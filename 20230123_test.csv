Using the fast shutter mode kills any dynamic range. There's a noticeable lack in quality with that setting on. 

Also, the 10x zoom camera just refuses to focus sometimes.

A few months ago, this wasn't a huge issue. I went on a trip to London (famously cloudy) and 99% of the pictures I took were great. Recently it feels like if I don't have perfect lighting I might as well not take pictures at all.

I love the phone, adore the design, and really admire some of the features on this flagship.

But for whatever reason, the battery just seems to ALWAYS drain so fast...

I came from a POCO X3, with the dame 5000 mAh battery, and I could easily get through a whole day (and some) with it.
However, for this phone, I'm constantly in the low numbers, even being able to literally see the drain when I'm playing a simple game.

I've used the Universal Debloat tool right when I got the phone, and I dont have Always on Display enabled.

Can I do more, or is the battery just to be expected to drain so much on this phone?

16,"Hard issue to describe, but S22 ultra (and 2 replacements) are not working in the same way. looking to see if this is a known issue, or how to fix.","Basically after around a few hours of use the phones response to touches becomes delayed by 10 or so seconds, and sometimes never responds. The phone is just slow overall. When the phone is on the lock screen, unlocking it simply takes away the ui and is still locked with only a background showing. Holding down the power button causes the power options to flash VERY quickly for fractions of a second before disappearing. If you manage to hit restart in that fraction it will restart, and work for a few hours before repeating this issue. In addition the sim tray is intermittent in working.

My problem is, I had pre-ordered a S22 ultra and got it on release day. A few months later this happened and I got the device replaced. A few months later that one started having the issue. I got that one replaced. Now after about a week of use my current one is having this issue. To my knowledge I do not have anything downloaded that would cause issues. I do not have any apps downloaded from anywhere other than the play store. In addition, the apps I do have installed are all well known safe apps. It is a 512gb model with the max amount of additional ""ram"" added from internal storage.

Basically looking to see if anyone has advice on fixes, or what the issue may be?

I have tried factory resetting. Resetting phone settings back to default. Resetting, and reinstalling apps when this issue happens (I thought it was snap at first cause it happened the first few times on snapchat but has since happened on other apps), and a few other basic troubleshooting tips that both Verizon and Samsung have asked me to do.

83,"Galaxy S22 Sammy 🌥 Backup problem, fixable?","TL;DR: Wondering if I can merge my lost S21 🌥 backup (that I have to wait for access to through Samsung) w/ my new S22's (that I'm currently using) current photos, texts, contacts etc. so that I don't lose the bulk of my already backed up stuff? 

~ I tried to explain my issue in the most uncomplicated way, but please feel free to ask me anything, bc I don't know if I even made it make any sense, lol. 😅 AND apologies for the long-ass post! SUPER THANK YOU in advance for any help! 🙏 


I recently lost my Samsung S21, &amp; had to purchased a new S22 to replace it, but I've run into a backup issue. When I had my S21 I had it backing up to the Samsung 🌥 automatically, &amp; I turned on 2 step verif. for better security. The issue I have now is my new S22 has a new 📱 number, so I can't receive my 2 step verfication sms from my Samsung 🌥 acct, bc it goes to my old 📱 number. I have my login &amp; password, but I can't receive my 2 step verif. code on my new number, so I can't access my Sammy ⛅ acct. 

Normally this wouldn't be an issue but all my info. photos, texts, contacts, calendar, app backup, etc. are in my Samsung 🌥 acct I can't access. So, when I set up my new phone it's empty bc I can't restore my backup. 

I talked to Samsung who said they could temporarily remove my 2 step verfication, so that I could access my Samsung 🌥 acct, I just have to provide the necessary info they need to prove I own the account, which I have. Then I'll be able to change my 📱 number on my acct to my new 📱number, then I'll be able to receive my 2 step verf. code, &amp; load my backup on my new 📱. 

This resolution will work, but it will take Samsung 5 business days to get the process done, which leads to my actual ❓, bc I would rather not be phoneless for 5+ days unless I have to be. 

My ❓ is, if I were to use my new 📱 &amp; number as normal until Samsung is able to regain my access to my Sammy ⛅ acct. would it be possible to backup my newer photos, texts, etc. to my existing sammy acct backup once I have access to it? Then reload the full backup, or will my newer files automatically overwrite my current backup, wiping out all my previously backed up stuff? 

I was under the impression that when my 📱 was backing itself up to the 🌥 it was doing an incremental backup each time, &amp; just updating the backup with the newer info only, (similar to what a  🖥  backup does). 

So, if that's the case I was 💭 I could hopefully use my S22 as normal, &amp; then when I get access to my Sammy 🌥 backup from my lost S21 (that I have to wait for access to) I can immediately backup my new S22 to my Sammy 🌥 acct. which would hopefully just do an incremental backup (updating the backup w/ my current info), and then I could restore the complete backup to my S22, &amp; all my photos, text, etc. would be intact.",Y,None,2023-01-23 13:44:00,True,False,False,True,False,False,True

Of course that's the main reason why I'm looking into Samsung and especially the S21 or S22 ultra due to the 10x Optical zoom as well. 

However apart from the obvious camera differences I'd love to have some more knowledge about the phones. I have a few things which I'd love to know more of!

- How big is the difference between the S21 and S22 ultra in terms of features? Is it worth the extra money?

- does Samsung have screen off gestures like a V for flashlight or an arrow to skip songs? I love that on the Oneplus.

- what is the battery and charging like on both phones? I read the S21 only has 25W changing?

- how is the software on Samsung? I've never used One UI before and Oxygen OS is quite nice.

- do you think one of these phones is worth the upgrade over my Oneplus 9 Pro?

117,Anyone upgrading to the Galaxy S23 Ultra?,"I'm personally not going to upgrade. It's the definition of an incremental update, the one thing I wish I could have in this phone is the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 especially if the s23 Ultra gets the overclocked version. My Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 is by no means slow but it's not very power efficient.Everything else seems pretty mediocre, that new gen 2 ultrasonic fingerprint scanner should be insane though, supposedly you could touch anywhere on the lower portion of the screen and it will register your finger. The IQOO 9 pro and IQOO 11 have it and it's a really nice feature to have. I couldn't care of less about the 200 megapixel camera, I have literally never taken a single 100 megapixel photo with this phone. I do like the 100 times hybrid zoom, I love taking pictures of the moon and I'm sure that s23 Ultra will do that better but I'm doubting it'll do it $1,500 better. Maybe if they went back to the Note 20 design language I'd be more inclined to buy, but for now I feel like my S22 Ultra is going to last me a few years.",N,None,2023-01-23 13:44:00,True,True,False,True,False,False,False
