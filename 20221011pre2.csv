How to Guide: OTA and Non-OTA Firmware for S22/S22+/S22 Ultra SNAPDRAGON	"This guide will allow you to flash unlocked U1 firmware onto any Snapdragon carrier phone and remove the carrier bloatware. You can also flash a carrier firmware onto an unlocked U1 firmware. 
**Firmware**​
All of the firmware posted here can be flashed on any U or U1 Device. Each of the firmware's are NOT carrier dependent and only has carrier labels listed in order to have an idea if you might get OTA when you flash it.
The firmware packages house each of the carrier's information, features, bloat, splash screens etc. (That's why they roll in at over 7Gb). When you flash a firmware the installation package reads your SIM, determines what carrier you're using and then installs the ""package"" that's designed for your carrier​
Spoiler: Understanding Firmware naming
S908USQU1AVA7 (Totally fake Firmware. I just made it up for example purposes)
S=Galaxy S
908U or F etc, the model of device
SQ, FX etc = CPU and model specific
U,S,E = Update, Security, Engineering, respectively
1,2,3,4,5 etc = bootloader revision (This is important! You cannot go to a previous revision)
A, B, C etc = Android version
U, V = Year (U=2021, V=2022 etc)
A,B,C etc = month (January A - December L)
1 - 9 and then A - Z =build compilation. This basically means how many builds there are in a month. They start at 1 and go to Z
So S908USQU1DVAM would be
S908-U-SQ-U-1-A-V-A-7
S908U (S22 Ultra Carrier version), SQ (Snapdragon), U (Update), 1 (Bootloader version), A (Build 12), V (2022), A (January), 7 (7th build)
**How to enter Download Mode: ​**
Turn off the device.​
Connect USB cable to your PC (Leave it disconnected from the phone)​
Press and hold down the Volume Up and Volume Down buttons. While they are still pressed, plug in the USB cable into your phone.​
The phone will go into download mode press volume up. In Odin you will see that phone is added.​
A decent writeup on how to use Odin:​
How to Flash Samsung Phone Firmware Using Odin​: https://samsungfirmware.net/how-to-flash-samsung-firmware-using-odin/
**Flashing procedures**
CSC and USER DATA = full wipe 
HOME_CSC = No wipe
If there is no user_data in the zip file you downloaded then it's not needed. 
Clean flash:
Do a back up prior to using Odin. 
Load these into Odin​
BL​
AP​
CP​
CSC​
Dirty Flash:​
I would only do this if you are having to manually update to the newer firmware and would not do it if you are coming/going to U/U1 or from beta firmware or if you are on an old firmware. I'd also highly recommend doing a back up prior to the doing this​
Load these into Odin​
BL​
AP​
CP​
HOME_CSC​
Do NOT flash CSC or USERDATA (If it's in the download package), either of these WILL wipe your device.​
​
This is a ""dirty flash"" and these can sometimes cause issues. Keep in mind if things start going sideways and stuff starts not working right, your first step to a solution will be to wipe the device.

Question for s22 base exynos owners	"It's about a week now since i'm thinking about s22. I really like the base model and everthing about it...except battery life. My major concern is will it last a day... I don't consider myself a heavy user. From 8:00 to 16:00 i'm at work listening to music connected via bt speaker, cheking a bit IG,FB and several other apps, when i get back home i usually have around 50% of battery left and i charge my device, let's say twice a day. And im fine with that. 
Currenly owning p20 pro, 4000msh battery.
Will s22  be able to handle this kind of usage? Will it last at least like my current phone?
P.s. sorry for my bad english"	N
Finally upgraded from the Galaxy S8	"S22 Ultra 256gb black.

S22 base model : battery concerns	guys, I'm going back and forth considering whether I should buy S22, it's the perfect phone for me except the battery concern me so much, I've seen people get 2hr 30min to 4 hr SOT then there's also people with 4 hr SOT to more than 7hr SOT. can you guys share your experience with the battery? I'm thinking about buying other phones but I also have no idea what other phone I should buy, I'm thinking A52s 5G or IPhone 11 or maybe phones from other brands.	N

Is it me or is the battery life on samsungs phones just plain bad?	"I currently have Oneplus 8 Pro ands im considering a switch to the Samsung S22 ultra but since im in the UK i'll have to get the Exynos version and so i was concerned about battery life / performance etc over the snapdragon variant. Now from some fair amount of watching youtube and reddit reviews etc the common consensus seems to be not to expect much beyond 4-6h screen time(best case scenario).  
so is this real life day to day usage people are seeing? my Oneplus only has 4500Mah battery and iget between 6 and 7 SOT and i was hoping the Samsung would get me more screen time not infact less?  
Has anyone else swicthed from an 8 pro to SS2U ? thanks"	N

Base S20 Exynos. Upgrade to S21 Exynos or S22 Exynos (base not plus or ultra)	"Hi Guys, trying to figure out whether to upgrade to the new S22 or the S21.
I do NOT play games. Occasionally watch video on the train/flight etc. Mainly use it for browsing/tiktok/social media. Spends quite a bit of time being used as a hot spot.
My main concern is the battery life of the S20.  The performance and cameras I am not too fussed about. So it comes down to battery. I will upgrade within 2 years so 4 years of updates isnt a big deal for me. 
S22 £690
S21 £350 (Second hand, not fussed, comes with a warranty)
What would those who have upgraded either from a S20 to a S22 or a S21 suggest?"	N

Coming from iPhone 13 Pro Max	"Hey guys, 
I used to be an Android user, the last 2 year I have been on iOS, I get tired of it so I decided to sell the 13 Pro Max and buy the S22 ultra...I can tell you guys, it's have been one of the worst experiences I have with a flagship phone, I hopping the device will get better with some updates, but compared with the 13 Pro Max the battery is garbage, Apps crashing, Twitter works better on 60hz than 120hz, honestly o don't know why Samsung can't debut the devices ready for use, is always like that, the device will get usable like, 4 or 5 months later.

I have the same software on 3 different phones and they are all on the same WiFi network.
The other two phones (note 9 and Poco X3 pro) have no issues with the software, the s22u will not allow camera viewing in high quality, just mid and low...
I've tried adjusting various settings on the s22u with no joy.
I know this is a very specific issue but someone else may have come across it :)"	N
Now after pre-ordering is over, trade in values have substantially increased... gee, thanks Samsung.	My S21's trade in towards the S22 was $390. Got a $100 accessory voucher for preordering. But now the trade in values are much higher. S21 is worth $550 towards an S22, and they're giving a $100 play store voucher. A bit annoyed by this. $160 more for trade in + Play store credit seems like a much better deal than a $100 accessory voucher, for some shit I didn't really need/want.	N

S22 Ultra first impressions	"Feels very premium (would hope so for the cost).
Cameras are unreal (coming from s10+)
Battery life is decent.
S pen is something I never thought I need... turns out I do. (Also does anyone know if the pen is ip68/the phone still is ip68 rated without the pen in?)
The phantom Black version has a slight purple tint in certain lighting which is adds a little something extra to break the black up.
Will update on battery life and overall thoughts after a few days with it :)
Any questions please ask :)"	N
Having problems with s22 ultra wifi signal on exynos	Hello! Is this only happening to me?

S Pen on Galaxy S22 Ultra - odd smell?	"I know this will likely get some odd reactions, but I'm actually serious. Anyone else notice a pungent aroma from their S Pen in the Galaxy S22 Ultra?

Still can't get hotspot to turn on. It just vibrates	"I've posted in here a few times, but i haven't figured it out. I'm on Google Fi. I also tried this with a T-mo sim. Neither plans are locked and should have no restrictions. Also, i can use same sim on my old pixel 3, and it works..
So here is what's happening: i go into ""hotspot and tether"", i click the slider, and it will vibrate and slide on for a nano second, then go back to ""off"" BUT then it will try (by itself) to turn on 3 more times while vibrating. So it's like something is preventing it from staying on."	N
s22 base sd battery	"Hey, thank you everyone who posted their sot.  
I want the s22 but the question, more important than sot, is if the s22 battery lasts a full day, 7am to lets say 22-23 pm and how much battery left. Or how many hours per charge.  
preferably people who use 4g all day, adaptive or 60hz refresh rate, light mode, mixed use of web surfing, spotify with bluetooth, whatsapp, social, and a little of calls, camera etc.  
if 60hz extends the battery a lot i think it's ok. But having to charge the phone during the day is a big no."	N

Question about return.	"I ordered an s22 ultra, a galaxy watch 4 and buds bundle for $768 total after trade-in/discounts. 
The s22 ultra is a bit too big for me and I want to go S22 or S22+ so I iniated a return. The return email says my refund will only be $460, but it only lists the s22 ultra to return. So I went ahead and iniated a return for the watch and buds(which I don't want to keep either) but the emails say the returns will be $0. 
I contacted 3 different Samsung support agents and they all told me that I need to ship each item seperately with their own labels and assured me I'll get refunded for the full $768. 
Has anyone gone through this and do I have anything to worry about? I don't want to be screwed out of $300 if I don't have to. 
Thanks in advance to anyone who responds."	N

Delays with S22 Ultra pre-order?	I ordered a S22 Ultra (256, black) a week ago with a trade in for my Pixel 3a XL. Order confirmed via email, delivery date said Feb 25. The next day, the Feb 25 date changed to "we will update shopping info shortly" or something to that effect. No changes since then. I stopped by local Verizon store; they said all looked normal, but to call the loyalty 800 # if nothing by Tuesday. So, just called the loyalty #, waited 15 minutes and got disconnected with no call back. Has anyone else experienced delays? From all I've read, the 256/black is not one of the backordered models. This is also my first 'upgrade' with Verizon so I'm not sure what to expect. I ordered a case for the new phone after the phone order and already received that.	N

Activating esim on S22 wipes phone?	"I just spent 4hrs setting up my new s22. After it was setup, I activated the esim so it would have service. Esim activated fine then wanted to restart phone. At startup, phone appears to be completely wiped. It is putting me through all setup screens like when new.
I am going to throw the phone through the fucking wall...
Why in the fuck would you wipe my phone for adding an esim??? I lost 4hrs of my fucking life and now will have to do it all over. Plus the data is active now, so it will do a bunch of stuff I didn't want it to do automatically now as I race to stop the data flow before it downloads a bunch of garbage.
Additionally, I have an error saying my rate plan is not compatible with my device. I'm on Magenta Max....
Tmobile CS could not have cared less about my lost time.
There is absolutely no warning on there website stating android devices will be wiped if you follow there do it yourself activation process.
UPDATE: So, when tmobile CS activated the second one over the phone, no issue.
It's when I followed the steps outlined by Tmobile that my S22 reset itself and gave me a ""unauthorized attempt to factory reset"" message.

FedEx gave my package with S22 Ultra to someone else!!	"I get a notification at around 5:30 that my package is delayed and to pick it up from FedEx ship center. At around 6:30 I get an email that my package is delivered!. I feel apprehensive already but think that may be since it went to the FedEx Center they marked it as delivered. 7:30pm I go to the Center and my fear is confirmed! They tell me that some one picked it up!!!!. According to the employee they checked the ID and it matched!!!
I ask how this can be, they have no answer. They say we will contact our security and they will review the cameras. In the meanwhile there is nothing to do
I am so mad right now!! I paid via PayBright so can't even do a credit card dispute! 
If anyone has been in similar a situation any guidance will be appreciated.
Steps I have taken:
Called FedEx Customer Support and opened an inquiry (Got an incident number)
Submitted an online Police Report regarding fraud under $5000. Got a temporary report number and the email said I should get a case number in around 5 business days.
Samsung Support is closed right now and I will be calling them tomorrow.
Any ideas if the above 2 will be enough for Samsung to send me another phone? Or if that is not possible how will refund work if I paid with PayBright?
I have the serial number and IMEI in my order in account, can Samsung blacklist the phone?
I ordered a white 1TB model and now it is out of stock!! Also used the $100 coupon code which is now wasted even if I am able to order again!

Longlife iphone user - first day with S22U	"Coming from 13 pro ,
Samsung one ui experience is out of the world,
Phone is amazing - display, smoothness , sound quality , split screen, screen popup, i don't know where to start lol, so happy on my decision
Will update the post with further experience
Any tip is more then welcome"	N
S22+ battery life	"This is my 5th day of using the phone, and the battery life is really disappointing.  
My A71 lasted the whole day, where as with the S22 plus my battery is sitting at 35% with 2,5 hours of SOT.  
Will the adaptive battery feature bring any improvements, or should I prepare for returning the device?  
I have the Exynos version by the way."	N
Poor game performance on S22 phones due to Game Optimizing Service (a.k.a Samsung cheating benchmark scores)	"Recently on Korean websites, there has been a lot of talks about S22 series phones severely underperforming on games.  At first people thought it was due to the games not optimized for the Snapdragon 8 gen1, but it looks like the Game Optimizing Service makes the phone underperform by a lot.  Even though the benchmark scores were good, these new phones were not meeting people's expectation in games like CoD, Genshin and etc.  
When some Korean tech youtubers ran more tests, they found out that benchmarks are not at all affected by GOS whereas most of popular games are severely affected in a negative way.  Someone changed the benchmark tool package's name to Genshin and set GOS to run it at max performance, and it resulted the benchmark score to go down almost by 50%
Even though this does not affect day to day use, it's probably a good idea to avoid Samsung phones for a while if you're planning to play games on it.  OnePlus was criticized for benchmark manipulation when they released OnePlus 9 and I'm honestly surprised that this hasn't caused any backlash yet."	N
Just got the s22 ultra	Upgraded from my Note 9 with 6 gigs of ram to the ultra 512gb that has 12 gigs of ram. This phone is so smooth. Battery life I can't comment on yet as I haven't had it long enough yet. My Note 9 which I got shortly after launch still had amazing battery life when I retired it today. Camera is great. Still getting used to the slight size difference. I have no complaints. This phone is great and would recommend.	N
Any recommended screen protectors for S22 Ultra in the UK?	"Hi there!
Got my S22 Ultra yesterday (said it'd come 15th March so this was a pleasant surprise!) and I'd like a screen protector for it. Problem is it has curved edges so that makes getting one annoying. So, has anyone had any luck with specific screen protectors that cover the entire screen and preferably glass?"	N
Disappointed in the low-res S22 Display, upgraded from an S8	"So I got my new s22 yesterday and as I woke up today &amp; used my phone in bed, I began to notice how easily you can see the pixels on this display.
I was not aware they downgraded the display resolution to 1080. I find it extremely noticeable.
I'm used to 1080 mode on my S8, but I did a side by side comparison and I can't see any pixels or blurriness on my S8 running at the same resolution. It must look better since it's a higher res screen running at a lower res.
This is going to annoy the hell out of me, this phone barely feels like an upgrade. The screen itself isn't any better in terms of visual fidelity as far as I can tell either. 120hz is nice but not worth these blury pixels"	N
Where's my screenshot folder? (S22 Ultra)	"For every Android phone I've owned. Google photos has an automatic screenshot folder than can be synced separately and not included with your actual camera photos.
Now my screenshots are mashed in with my normal pics in backup and sync....
What's changed?"	N
Does S22 Ultra support Bypass Charging? (Refer Asus ROG Phone Feature)	"As the title implied, Bypass Charging is a feature that bypass the battery and powering the phone directly when plugged in. Resulting in not wearing the battery as much, and less heat generated.
With the ~~Note~~ S22 Ultra being geared to be a productivity device, I invision such feature would be a great addition for those long hours of drawing, DeX...etc sessions, among other typical burst of productivity work you do at a cafe. While not fully capable of replacing a desktop OS based laptops, I'd imagine the S22 Ultra is plenty capable of lighter task and for those who want to stay lightweight and extra mobile.
PS: Return of the phablet, productivity of a tablet while retaining functionality and portability of a phone, all that without needing to carry two devices."	N

Galaxy S22 - Samsung Keyboard - no 'incognito'...	"Hi,

Samsung has better trade value post pre-order. You can get refunded the difference.	"If you pre-ordered this year you probably saw how bad the trade in deals this year were and now we know why. So they can still entice people post pre-order. Yes the pre-order deals are solid year to year but it has to be said, Samsung is pretty sketchy when it comes to pre-order time.
I'm not sure what they did for the s20/s21 around pre-order time but if anyone remembers s10 pre-orders they had much much better trade in credit. In the US at least, for people who pre-ordered the s10/s10+ (not s10e) they got galaxy buds or 130$ credit for pre-ordering. Here's where the sketchy part comes in, 2 days before pre-order bonus was ending they were sneaky and changed it so people who pre-ordered s10e get 130$ e-credit, leaving those who pre-ordered the s10e earlier received nothing. My guess is they were probably banking on people not noticing and causing a fuss. During that time at least those who called it out had to fight them over a month about it to get that e-credit.  
Well similar here they are probably banking on people not caring post pre-order, or noticing that their trade in value is now higher for their phone. The good news is there wasn't any fuss at all this time around. Chat rep has promised to refund the difference AFTER your phone you send back is received by them. In my case the difference is 125$ refunded since they are offering 275$ for s10e trade in compared to the 150$ during pre-order.
Make sure you don't do the chat function through the home page because they will just ask you to go through the support link on the bottom/top, select the options below. Take screen shots of everything as well, my rep even told me to do so which was cool.
Bottom links--&gt;Order support--&gt;Trade in--&gt;Still need help?/Contact us--&gt;Contact reason/Trade in--&gt;Select reason(I chose ""something else"")--&gt;Contact us."	N

S22 Ultra - Spigen thin clear cases differences	"In case anyone was wondering what the differences are between the Spigen Liquid Crystal (right) and Spigen Ultra Hybrid (left) clear cases, then here you go.

The hybrid is has a more solid back and is a smidge thicker all around. The camera cutout is larger too.
&amp;#x200B;
The liquid crystal is the thinnest and has more precision cutouts for the camera lenses.

Bye bye s22U	Yes , I did the swap , got s22U and Tab s8 Ultra , sent back the fold 3 . However after nearly I week I have realised it was a mistake . Carrying around two devices instead of one is a pain, and actually the fold 3 when folded is easier to carry around than the s22 Ultra . Obviously the s22 camera is amazing , but it's not that much better in normal use than the fold 3 . Not saying the fold 3 is perfect , but once you go fold you really can't go back ( for people who love it anyway !). I travel every day , often staying away, so having once device and one charger that does it all is amazing . I don't even need my galaxy watch charger I can use reverse charging . The Tab s8 Ultra is a beast and I love it , but so far I am finding it less easy to multi task on it than the fold . Example : I do my expenses every day, which involves photographing receipts and then loading up a web page to enter to enter the details and upload the images. With the s22U and the Tab u I have to take the photos on the phone and then quick transfer them over , as the screen on the s22U is still too small ...with the fold , it does it all . There are many more examples . But that's just my use , it isn't for everyone , and the s22 is a beast .	N
S22 Snap, Insta and Tiktok Camera thing	Is this coming to this phone too or just the s22? It should come to every phone..	N
I switched to base s22 and I'm keeping the flip3	"I wanted to quickly share my thoughts. 
I love small phones but the s22 feels really small. I didn't like the size at all or how it felt in hand. 
Even thought on paper the s22 should perform better, I felt it was very laggy compared to the flip. It def didn't feel as snappy switching between apps and often got stuck trying to pull in signal for videos which my flip has never done. 
The speakers sound better on the flip. 
Cameras. So this one was tough. It was pretty even Stephen for me. One pic I'd get with the s22 and it would be much clearer than on the flip but then the next pic the flip would be clearer. I do believe that the s22 would win the camera battle though and should spec wise. When cropping photos you could tell a huge difference in clarity between the two and I felt like the s22 didn't over process as much as the zflip. 
Battery... The s22 lasted longer but it was so close for me it isn't worth switching bc I really really love the flip.  I'd say maybe an hour more of SOT and that just really depended on my activities for the day and yes I know it was still optimizing and updates help but I'm still not convinced those two things would impact SOT enough to make it far superior to the flip. 
And surprisingly I missed flex mode. I use the phone as a bedside clock or handsfree flashlight."	N

Trading in a financed phone [N20U to S22U]	"Last year I traded in my Note 9 for a Note 20 Ultra for 400 bucks. As you know, you get the money back through credits which manifests through a cheaper monthly bill till the phone is paid off. If you pay the phone off early you lose the rest of the trade in deal which for me is about 200 bucks.
I see Samsung's trade in deal for the S22 Ultra. It's 850 bucks. 
1. Can I trade in my financed phone to get this deal and continue paying my bill/old phone?
2. Do I have to walk into a Verizon to get the new phone *activated* and give those guys $100-$200 ish bucks to do it?

FirstNet users with S22/+/Ultra U1 phones please read before posting	"Due to the sheer amount of threads, here is a quick guide. If any of this is a foreign language, I highly suggest you buy your phone directly from the AT&amp;T website or a corporate store. I'm just a random firefighter who has used unlocked Samsung phones on FirstNet.
I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that AT&amp;T reps/support are not responsible for any hand holding, trying to get your uncertified device up an running on a subsidised government first responder network.
There is a lot of misinformation on this sub and forums, due to the fact that FirstNet is not recognised on the U1 firmware as ATT CSC. Years ago it was thought to be a fluke, it is clearly by design at this point. If you are not willing to put the carrier version of the firmware onto your device, I suggest either Verizon, T-Mobile or AT&amp;T consumer service.
First, you need to download [Frija](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/tool-frija-samsung-firmware-downloader-checker.3910594/) and [Patched Odin](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/patched-odin-3-13-1.3762572/) from XDA developers. You will need a Windows PC for this process.
Open Frija and place it in manual mode, copy and paste the line items (Model/CSC(region)/PDA/CSC(version)/Phone) that you see once you click on the lastest TMB firmware, from the following links. (You can download directly from this site, but it is going to be brutally slow compared to Frija which uses Samsung servers.)
[S22](https://samfrew.com/model/SM-S901U/region/TMB/)
[S22 Plus](https://samfrew.com/model/SM-S906U/region/TMB/)
[S22 Ultra](https://samfrew.com/model/SM-S908U/region/TMB/)
Once everything is finished, extract the zip and open Patched Odin. In Odin select all the matching firmware pieces and use Home\_CSC if you would like avoid a factory reset. Put the phone in download mode, flash and then let the phone restart.

Galaxy S22 Ultra eSim	I want to activate my Galaxy S22 Ultra using eSim. How can I do this? I received a new 5G sim, but no eSim information. Does AT&amp;T Support eSim on Android like they do iOS? Do I still have to go to an AT&amp;T store to get the QR code or can this be done online or through phone or chat support online? Am I better off just activating and using the regular SIM that came with my device?	N
S22 trade in?	I ordered a s22 ultra and i seen where I can get $800 off through billing credits. I also seen where I can take in any galaxy s series phone In any condition and get the $800. I bought a busted up galaxy s3 on ebay. I mean this thing is in terrible condition. Looks like it's been ran over. The imei is clean. The pin code to get into the phone can't be taken off since the screen is so bad. Will they still take it? It says online any condition	N
Did not pre-order S22Ultra	For those of you that did not pre-order a S22Ultra and ordered directly through AT&amp;T website. How long before you are scheduled for delivery? I am showing mine will not ship until March 29-April 12. I ordered February 28. Not that I am in dire need of the phone, my Note 10+ works fine and I have an old S7 edge I am trading in for the bill credits. Just wondering what others wait time might be.	N
S22+ replacement screens	Do you think the T-Mobile full service repair shops have the S22+ replacement screens in stock, yet? I was walking down a flight of hardwood floor stairs ,in my socks ,and slipped going down and scratched the screen on my S22+. I do have the 360 protection plan.	N
Just picked up a Galaxy S22 - Ultra discussion about screen protectors.	This is the first time I went "full in" getting the best model (although I didn't, because I didn't get 512 gig, nor that slick green). I want to continue not using a screen protector, because I hate them. I feel they take away from functionality. Is this a mistake? This is the first phone I've bought that exceeds 1,000 buckaroos. A coworker said that the stylus can wear into the screen?? Is that true?	N
Samsung s22 ultra is better in camera than iPhone 13		N
I Love Everything About the S22 Ultra, Except One Thing Comes to Mind...	"A curved screen for a phone with a pen was not smart at all. 
I do wish the curved era would just come to an end. 
Whenever I get close to the edge the pen slides off the curve. 
Sure you can say I'm nitpicking, but try to use the selection tool and get an image all the way to the edge of the screen. 
Or just do anything near the edge and see how little effort it takes to catch the edge and slip away. 
Pretty annoying right?"	N
S22 Ultra worth it now or wait till Holiday deals?	"I have a S10 and with the current deal on Samsung's site I can trade it in and along with first responder discount get the S22 Ultra 256GB for $880 pre-tax. 
I'm just debating if I should get it now (tax refund purchase) or wait it out till Black Friday to see if there's a better deal going on.
Who else upgraded from the S10 (no issues with it) to the ultra? Good decision or wish you waited for better price? I got my S10 12/2019 after I shattered my S8 screen so it'll be 3 years old end of year. I've never had a top tier phone and figured this generation maybe be the one!
I'd mainly get this for the camera, I'm not a professional photographer nor social media influencer but take a lot for memories and sharing within my own network. S pen would be new to me as well"	N
S22 Ultra. I've looked everywhere and can't find how to set up employee ID like in the video. Anyone have any luck?	"Maybe I'm not searching for it right? I've looked on YouTube, Google to no avail. If anyone can help it'll be much appreciated. It was one of the reasons I upgraded from the note.

Any one else’s S22 Ultra getting delivered on March 25th ? 🤔	I preordered on the 12th of March, my original delivery date was March 4th , and now just today morning it got pushed til the 25th of March, I got the 256 Phantom Black TMobile	N
s22 ultra exclusive colour frame	If anyone has already received an exclusive colour for the s22 Ultra, I wanted to know if the frame of the phone is matte or glossy black. The images on the website shows a matte finish, but I wanted to confirm if that is true for the actual device as well. Thanks!	N
Spigen screenfilm + UAG Plasma case = ultimate S22 ultra protection	"My beloved but recently retired Note 8 was protected for 4 1/2 years from a Blu Apigen Tough armor case and a cheap screen film that was a bit orange peel but it worked well all around. 
But with my really sexy and expensive phantom white 512gb unlocked S22 Ultra, I really wanted to enjoy the natural phone color but also still have good protection as God forbid, it's not if but when I drop my phone despite my best efforts not to do so.
Not to mention my phone goes in and out of coats and jean pockets a lot for my datacenter work as well as at home, and I still don't have full trust that Gorilla glass will totally prevent scratches, so I wanted something to still protect the screen as well, and I'm still pissed about the loss of $50 for the white dome on my Note 8 being crap, so I wasn't gonna give them a try again on my dime. So I decided to give spigen neo flex a try and I was very pleased at how even it went on after drying off, almost no orange peel texture and the screen curves held very well after putting pressure on them
For the case initially went for spigen again but all the colors of the tough armor and hybrid were ugly and I couldn't see my phones natural color either, so I gave the Spigen Hybrid Ultra a try first for a week.  While it did allow me to see the phones beauty, I was worried about the reduced phone protection vs the spigen tough armor I was used to, it was a bit flimsy.
https://imgur.com/a/BIaQuis
So some more Amazon digging around I came across UAG prodict lineup and saw their Plasma series and I couldn't believe my luck, they had a clear hard case! So hit that bad boy in my fast cart check out!
Just got it today and slapped it into ""Hoth"" my phone and wow, it's perfect! It doesn't add too much more bulk but adds enough width for hands to get a good grip while texting, the multiple textures and angles allow easy holding of the phone even with sweaty hands. The corners are enlarged to take drops better and the screen is slightly more raised vs the spigen.
Oh and of course the best partz I still get to enjoy my phones lovely white color thanks to clear plastic! It's a winner winner, chicken dinner combo!

Does the S22u need some sort of update to utilize 45w fast charging, or is this speed normal?	"For reference, I used my old note 8 fast charger and compared it to the new $50 45w Samsung charger, and the speed difference said 1 minute!
I think I'll need to drain my battery a little more to test if it makes a difference at a lower battery level, but at 82%, there seems to be too little a difference for me to keep this charger. I got this for $8 after discounts, and I still might return it, unless of course it charges faster at a lower level.

The S22 Ultra (256 GB - Phantom Black) I have been using for a few days has been performing so well!	"I must say, well done Samsung. At least for me everything has been smooth, the screen is so freaking responsive it makes me so glad I sold my Pixel 6 Pro. I feel at home with Samsung's One UI 4, and the amount of features the phone has is overwhelming me! I hope Samsung can address the battery life though as I can't really get a lot of screen on time, especially when watching YT videos over WiFi. And playing games. I'm confident the upcoming software update will iron out some optimization issues.
From the Always On Display, customization options, performance settings, etc, this phone is so innovative it makes me realize why I've always have wanted to own a Samsung phone.
Overall though, this is a great phone. It's big, feels great to hold, is super responsive and I have yet to fully take advantage of the camera and S-Pen. 
How's your Samsung S22, Plus, or Ultra? I'd love to hear your story and opinion. Thank you x3"	N
torn between s22+ and the ultra	"im with tmobile and i currently have both the pixel 6 pro and iphone 12 pro max. im **1000%** trading in my pixel 6 pro. terrible phone. 
anyway, the difference between the s22+ and the ultra dont seem that much different outside of the camera which i wouldnt use much. 
i had a note 20 ultra and only used the pen once and it got me a kiss with a cute girl 😳.
my biggest concern was the s22+ didnt seem like much of an upgrade to the pixel and the ultra only seemed worth it if i got the 256gb version."	N

s22 ultra risking burn in for no reason by randomly waking up and not going back to sleep	I've found my s22 ultra 3 times now stuck at the lock screen with max brightness for several hours this only happens while it's charging	N
Alarm on S22+ not working properly for me	Previously I was using S10+ and would have phone on silent no vibrate at night with alarm set for mornings. The alarm would sound at the set volume through the clock app. Fast forward to my S22+, I put phone on Silent, or vibrate bc I can't figure out how to put on silent no vibrate like I could do with S10+. My alarm will just do a soft vibrate now for like a minute then snooze itself. Has anyone else had this problem and found a fix for it?	N
S22 Ultra 45W Charging "Controversy" Discussion	"As titled, I am not really calling into doubt Samsung's claim, but as my new samsung 45w fast charger (EP-T4510) arrived today and using a power-z KT002 USB PD Tester, charging from 24% to 92% gives me the following graph:
basically it ramps up to 27w\~29w from the start
and will start dropping from around 75%\~80% until its around 10w only
dont mind the sudden drops in the middle, I dont have more equipment to get other readings so just take it as a visual artifact
So......where's 45w? Maybe the 0\~20% range? God that would be stupid though.
[Graph Pic (Onedrive)](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ao7dGi2vaB0jhYMFWZ86yajasK1PkQ?e=rEbhXT)
Note: Before anyone doubts that my charger is faulty, i tested the Samsung charger on my Latitude 9420, my Latitude will draw 41\~42w from the charger, so the charger IS capable of 45w output"	N

Preferred Keyboard	"For all my previous phones, I've used Gboard. For this new S22 Ultra I thought I would give the Samsung keyboard a shot as I thought I read that it works better with the Spen then Gboard.

Facial Recognition Annoyance - Turn off?	When I use facial recognition to unlock an app, after my face is recognized, and before I can go into the app, I get a screen that is showing a message: "Verified. Tap confirm to continue".

I got my T-Mobile Galaxy S22 256GB Green last Thursday and let it do it's battery learning. After learning, the battery life was still pretty bad. I could only manage about 2-3 hours of SOT. So I decided to look online and see if there was anything I could do to optimize the battery. I found the guide above and decided to give it a try, worst case I have to factory reset. Following the presets exactly as is left me with some non-functioning things. My cellular connection didn't work, phone calls ended as soon as the other party accepted the call, etc. So I played with it until I came up with the lists linked below. Now everything works, the phone is smoother, faster, and the battery life is WAY better.

Dual SIM configuration issues	"I have a Canadian model Galaxy S22 Ultra (Snapdragon) and have an issue with how Samsung handles dual SIM set-up. 
Here's my screen under Settings - SIM Card Manager. 
https://imgur.com/a/1TjegB4
I want the Bell SIM (physical SIM) to handle most data-intensive tasks, but the Shaw one (eSIM) to handle SMS/MMS/RCS Messaging. It seems that if I set Bell as my Primary SIM, then the Shaw one won't allow MMS or RCS Messaging. It tells me to switch my primary SIM to Shaw if I want to do that.
It's been a while since I had a dual SIM Android phone but I don't recall having similar issues in the past. I don't think it's an APN thing either as these features work if only one SIM is available.

Regarding the display modes of the s22 ultra	"I have compared the natural display mode (preferred by me) between my galaxy note 10 plus and my S22 Ultra. The natural on the S22 ultra looks undersaturated compared to the note 10 plus which to my eye looks just right for a SRGB color mode. I would like others observations on this. Is the Note 10 plus better calibrated? In order for the s22 ultra to have a dynamic 120hr refresh rate did the color of the panel have to be compromised? I am hoping enough people notice and Samsung updates the natural profile to proper saturation.
Maybe the s22 ultra is more accurate but the note 10 plus has an extra punch to its srgb that reminds me of how the iPhone oled displays show color.

S22 Ultra Exynos 2200 issues - hardware or software?	"Do you think Samsung will be able to improve lower speed (lower compared to Snapdragon) with software update or we're just doomed in Europe stuck with bad hardware?
I don't see why they would put much worst hardware for one market, and better one for the other. That is something that tells me this is software issue they can improve at lest to some degree.
I've seen comments here that Exynos hardware is bad, but does anyone here knows if Samsung did improve its speeds on Exynos via software updates on previous Notes models? Did we learn anything from the past models and can we hope to receive some software update that will do a good job to catch up with Snapdragon?"	N
My thoughts on S21 Ultra vs S22 Ultra	"Alright, so I did a deep side-by-side comparison today of my S21 Ultra and S22 Ultra before trading the former in. My thoughts so far, YMMV:
&amp;#x200B;
Things to note, while comparing I had them both on the same settings for display, brightness, volume, and battery (both were fully charged). The S22U was on the Jan security patch while S21U was on the Feb patch. Both are T-Mobile versions. Both are the snapdragon versions (888 and 8G1).
&amp;#x200B;
Display:
S22U is notifiable brighter but not by much. Color temperature was definitely different for both the phones even after setting them up as similarly as possible. The S21U was slightly warmer colors than S22U. But this can be due to panel variance and is not anything major or of concern.
&amp;#x200B;
I did an HDR video playback test on both phones at the same time. Initially, the S22U screen flickered in brightness A LOT while playing back HDR video. After restarting the phone it seemed to have been fixed but overall the dynamic range of S21U definitely looked better to my eyes. I watched around 3 HDR videos at the same time.
&amp;#x200B;
Sound:
Clear winner: S21U by a significant margin. No matter what setting I changed or tweaked, I could not get the S22U speakers to sound close to S21U. The S22U speakers sounded tinier in comparison and had much less tight bass.
&amp;#x200B;
Like MKBD mentioned in his video, the vibration motor alignment was changed by Samsung which drastically reduces the perception of haptics at the same setting. Again not too major but it bothers me since I keep my phone on vibrate mode most of the time.
&amp;#x200B;
Aesthetics and Looks:
The back of the S22U looks much cleaner without any camera bump. I am impressed. But the added width definitely makes the phone feel significantly larger and more difficult to hold with one hand. This is a major issue for me.
&amp;#x200B;
Camera:
Rear camera: S22U is the clear winner, hands down. Better focus, colors, and low light compensation.
Front camera: For some reason, the colors and sharpness of the front camera are off on the S22U. There also seem to be some focus issues when compared to the S21U. Might be an issue with my unit, I am not sure.
&amp;#x200B;
Performance:
There is some lag while scrolling on the S22U similar to the issue S21U had when OneUI 4.0 was released. It's not as bad but is noticeable sometimes. Again nothing major and would probably be fixed in a software update. Thermals seem similar, although my S21U heated up and throttled often while gaming, so I don't think the S22U can be worse than that.
&amp;#x200B;
Overall, I have decided to return the S22U. Cost-wise, bundling with the Tab S8 ultra made the ""upgrade"" from S21U almost free, but it doesn't feel like an upgrade. The spen is great, but I don't use it enough for me to overlook the other things wrong with the S22U. Most of the things I have mentioned are fixable in future software updates, but the form factor is still an issue."	N
S22 ultra vs Z Fold 3	"Loving the s22 ultra. Had it for a little over a week now. Blazing fast. Sleek, with the Samsung leather case.
I thought I would miss my z fold 3, but nope. Sad to say everything is better optimized for this form factor on the s22 ultra compared to the fold 3. 
Every app just runs better. On the fold 3 alot of apps wouldn't know what to do when you open up the larger screen. It was annoying to say the least. 
The side finger print scanner on the fold 3 is amazing. Samsung needs to put it on all their devices. So much better than the in screen finger print scanner. 
The main two gripes I have about the fold 3 are the front screen and the non glass feel on the larger display (crease showing as well). 
The front display is too narrow. If they made it the same size as the s21 ultra I'd be all over it. Rumor is that the fold 4 will be keeping the same size front display as the fold 3. If that's the case, then I'll have to skip it.  Them adding a glass display with no crease on the large screen might keep me interested. 
It feels much nicer typing on an actual glass screen. Little nuances but they add up over time. 
The s22 ultra feels light as a feather compared to the fold 3.  Much much lighter. 
I really hope third party app makers get on board with optimizing their apps for foldables. I think it's going to take Apple releasing a foldable device for everything to start catching up, which could be years from now. 
Again, both if these devices are very different. Where the s22 ultra succeeds in that it knows what it is and does it very well because of that. 
The fold 3 is trying to be both a phone and a tablet and does both very mediocre ie the front display being too narrow and the larger display having an odd screen resolution form factor. 
Samsung has had over 10 years to perfect the galaxy line. The fold line is only three years deep so it's gonna take some growing pains, I get that. Hopefully by the fold 6 things start to really look good for foldables. 
For the better convenience and third party app optimization, I'm gonna have to recommend the s22 ultra over the fold 3."	N
Samsung S22 Ultra Hangs when unlocking.	hi guys, I am from the UK and i find it annoying that my phone usually hangs when i try to unlock, i need the screen to timeout before i can re-attempt to unlock the phone. Is it possible to return my phone to Samsung and ask for a cash back? London based here	N
S22 Ultra Cases or best ways to mitigate the horrendous wobbling because of the camera bumps when tapping the screen?	"I got the Spigen Thin Fit case for my S22 Ultra and the phone still wobbles when you press near the bottom right (and top left) corners of the phone when it's on a flat surface. Mildly infuriating, it wobbles when I type. I had hoped the Spigen case would remove some of the wobble, guess not.
Any cases that fix it? Might just get a thin sticky pad or paper and gluing it to the top left corner at the back!"	N
How do I snooze a notification for x time on s22u?	Coming from the s8 (android 9) and you could half slide the notification and choose to snooze it for 5 mins, 10mins, 1hr or 2hrs. Does anyone know how to do that in the s22u?	N
Has anyone in Australia got their S22 Exclusive colours?	"I ordered mine on 10th Feb and the order status still shows as customising. The checkout page said delivery will be in 3-4 weeks but it hasn't been shipped yet.

Funny thing is, I got the leather cover I bundled it with last week and I'm still waiting for the phone."	N
My current problem with the s22 ultra	"I was really hyped on getting the phone and by itself it's a fantastic phone, gorgeous, looks great and a very good camera. 
Big problem is that since I got it the phone restarted at least 20 times randomly without any hint on why it's happening. It's laggy and feels slow at times, it got an abysmal geek bench score and it's running hot most of the time. I really don't know what to do, if I wait I'll loose the 14 day return right and if I exchange it it'll take weeks until I get it back. Has anyone had the same problem with the exynos s22 ultra ?"	N
S22 battery	Got the new regular s22. pre-ordered it from samsung canada website and I've been using the phone for 10 days now. Really love the phone because its the perdect size for me but super disappointed with the battery life. My last usage graph is showing screen on time of just 3hrs40mins and screen off 1d15hrs. I've been just scrolling on social media with wifi and lte, streamed music on car Bluetooth and made few phone calls. Nothing super serious not even YouTube videos. I just switched from s7 plus after 5 years and it feels like my new s22 is draining battery so fast. I have power save enabled, battery optimized etc. Is this normal? Anyone else facing the same issue? Would appreciate some feedback. Thanks.	N

S22 Ultra Phone Hangs when unlocking	Hi guys i have an s22 ultra and it seems that i am experiencing lag when unlocking the phone sometimes. I need to wait for the screen to turn black before attemting to unlock it again. Any fix? This is exynos btw.	N
Problems with headphones with new S22?	So Ive had my Sony XM4 headphones for 4 months now and only just recently started having problems with them. I used them with my Galaxy S9 and always had them at full volume and was never told by anyone that they could hear my music at all. Well I just got a new Galaxy S22 and now whenever I use my headphones above 50-60% volume, its like the music is being broadcasted outside the headphones. Thats how insanely loud they are to everyone around me. Does this have something to do with new Bluetooth software or something? Is antone else experiencing this? Please forgive me, Im not tech savy at all	N
The UAG Plasma is a great case for the S22 Ultra	"My beloved but recently retired Note 8 was protected for 4 1/2 years from a Blu Spigen Tough armor case and a cheap screen film that was a bit orange peel but it worked well all around. 
But with my really sexy and expensive phantom white 512gb unlocked S22 Ultra, I really wanted to enjoy the natural phone color but also still have good protection as God forbid, it's not if but when I drop my phone despite my best efforts not to do so.
Not to mention my phone goes in and out of coats and jean pockets a lot for my datacenter work as well as at home, and I still don't have full trust that Gorilla glass will totally prevent scratches, so I wanted something to still protect the screen as well, and I'm still pissed about the loss of $50 for the white dome on my Note 8 being crap, so I wasn't gonna give them a try again on my dime. So I decided to give spigen neo flex a try and I was very pleased at how even it went on after drying off, almost no orange peel texture and the screen curves held very well after putting pressure on them
https://imgur.com/a/BIaQuis
Just got the UAG yesterday and slapped it into ""Hoth"" my phone and wow, it's perfect! It doesn't add too much more bulk but adds enough width for hands to get a good grip while texting, the multiple textures and angles allow easy holding of the phone even with sweaty hands. The corners are enlarged to take drops better and the screen is slightly more raised vs the spigen.

Is the s22 ultras camera supposed to move about a bit on the inside	Basically when I shake the phone you can hear one of the cameras rattle inside the lens thingy. Does anyone else's do that	N
S22 Ultra questions	"Really liking the specs of the ultra, I have had a nova 3i for over 5 years and it is only now getting annoying and too be honest if I cleaned a lot of the apps off it would probably still be fine. My biggest problems with it are the battery life and the charger port. It is loose as fuck, could probably get it replaced but I am using it as an excuse to buy a new phone.
I went and looked at the S22 ultra in person today and the curved screen is the most disgusting thing I have seen. Are there any cases that can mask that? Its pretty much a deal breaker and I am not sure if I can justify getting an S22+ when the specs of the ultra are that much better.
Also is there a way to change the app look? I'm not a fan of how bubbly everything is. Seen a lot of people complaining about poor battery life etc, should I hold off for a while before getting one or what's the go?"	N

Where's the "triple tap" screen magnification feature?	I'm having trouble finding the menu setting to triple tap the screen to magnify anywhere on the screen. Instead I have a small icon on the bottom right corner of the screen that when tapped once will show a square box for magnification which I don't like. It's not the same as doing the triple tap command. I found this feature useful on my Note 10+ phone, even my Samsung smart watch has that same feature. Thanks.	N
Lock screen video	What do you all use for lock screen video? This one is called Autumn Purple Neon smoke in the galaxy store and is what I currently use.	N
And extra 75$ off on my trade.	"Ok so my order has been a mess. All on me. I ordered on 2-10 and then cancelled on say the 24th. I ordered the s22ultra 256 red. So the usual custom order delay.  
When I did the order, samung gave me 425 for my note 10 plus and 100 for my tabs3. Well in the effort to not only keep my order but try and redo it, I went back thru the motions of ordering another. Well the system now says 500 for my note 10 plus. That's 75$ if my fingers and toes are correct. At some point I brought it up to one of the chat reps and they said they match trade Ins.  
So today I called for another issue and sure enough the rep pulled up the $500 and added it to my order so when I trade it in, I get the 500 not the 75.  
Not sure who else this fits, but try and give it a go."	N
Samsung Throttling Apps	"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-inv...9.html?src=rss

Case Hack	"So I've done this for years, but I never see anyone else doing it (I'm sure there are, of course). I had somebody recently see and ask me about it, so figured I'd share in case there are others like me that it could help. 
I need to have my phone protected, I am a network technician, and spend my days climbing utility poles, wiring buildings, often climbing in attics or crawling in crawl spaces. Also, I am driving half the day, and magnet mounts are absolutely the best for going in and out of truck all day, while also keeping my phone in reach (pop one in the shower or next to jacuzzi as well). In addition, I've become extremely reliant on a finger ring on the phone, so I don't drop the phone 100 times a day, while also making it way easier to use.  
I use NFC, I don't want to lose wireless charging, and while sometimes necessary, I don't want a 3lb brick for a phone all the time. So whenever I get a new phone, I get an OtterBox with belt clip (other cases with belt clips work, BUT most of them have very flimsy belt clips, not like the OtterBox), and I also grab an extra OtterBox belt clip for like $10 off Amazon. Then I put all my magnets and finger rings on the belt clips. Usually a magnet on the top and ring on the bottom. That way you can just have your phone when that's all you need, but to use magnet mounts or ring grips you just pop the belt clip on the back of phone.  
Stupid simple, just thought I'd share."	N
Best external hard drive for s22 ultra	Are Seagate a good brand, and are they compatible with cell phones. Also any other good long term storage for photos and videos besides computers? I'm getting the 516 gb in the s22ultra, but I want to store the best photos and videos on another device!	N
Trade in stolen	"I just got a email from Samsung saying they received an empty box. I'm going by the Fedex location I dropped it off at. Has anyone had this happen before? I know some phones have been stolen before, but haven't heard about the trade ins.  
It's crazy how someone at Fedex or along the way can just take something out of the box, reseal it I presume. I've contacted Samsung and they said they would investigate, but I'm not sure what they can do about it."	N
Phone payment setting question	"Having just moved back to Samsung, a S22 Ultra, after a few years with a Pixel, I am looking at Samsung Pay vs. Google Pay. I like the fact that I can put any card, and digital vaccination record into Samsung Pay. I don't see that you can do that with Gpay but I will have to investigate that further. But my question now concerns just Gpay: 
There is a setting in Gpay to turn on ""Purchase Authentication"". I can't get exactly what this is and how it differs from having to unlock your phone to use Gpay? 
Does turning off Purchase Authentication mean that you no longer have to unlock your phone to use Gpay at the grocery store? Or are the two things different? If they are different, what exactly extra happens when you turn on Purchase Authentication? 
Thanks."	N
Can you change this notification bar behavior?	"New phone, lots of questions, most of which I am figuring out myself ok. But here is another I cannot get figured out. 
First a simple question: What is the icon shown at the red arrow at the top of photo one?  It looks like an ""N"" but what would that be for? Maybe something saying I am using Nova Launcher? Just can't find anywhere what that icon is. 
Now the main question: 
When I get notifications on my top status bar and then drag it down to read them, the notifications are partially hidden within a dropdown option. See attached photo #1. I have to open the notification all the way or tap the dropdown symbol to see more of the notification and the options for responding. (as shown in photo #2). On an email or text this also means when I look at the notification, I have to do the 2nd step in order to see a summary of some of the text. On my old Pixel 2, I did not need to do this. The notifications were always displayed from the start as in photo 2 so I could tell at a glance what they all said. This also is an issue with front door camera notifications. Now they show as in photo 3 below whereas on my Pixel they always started out as shown in photo 4. Now I always have to open or dropdown the camera notification to see the image.  
This may not seem like a big deal on just one notification. But when I have 5 or 6 notifications it is an annoyance. Before, I could see enough of all 6 notifications to be able to just clear the whole list for later with one step to pull down the notification bar and a 2nd step to dismiss them all. Now with 6 notifications, I need to open all six of them one at a time to know if I can dismiss them. So with 6 notifications on my Pixel there were 2 steps needed. On my S22 with six notifications, there are at least 7 steps needed to do the same thing. 
How can I set my S22 Ultra to show these notifications dropped down right from the start?        "	N
Any way to switch to regular Google Messages (not OneUI version)?	"Has anyone found a way to install the original Google Messages on an ATT S22U phone? I'm not a huge fan of the OneUI version and also - this version locks you into using the ATT RCS backend (instead of the Jibe/Google backend) and therefore sets you back a few years into not being able to utlize RCS services except with other ATT users. So, I suddenly now cannot use RCS with most of my Android friends/family since they are not on ATT. I've tried installing the APK of the regular Google Messages but it won't install saying it's an invalid package. SIGH. There's a whole big hullabaloo on the ATT forums about this. Not holding my breath on ATT actually trying to fix this. 
I am guessing using an unlocked version with ATT sim would not have this problem."	N
When and how do I get billed for my Samsung financing for phone purchase?	I chose the Samsung 24 month financing for my S22 Ultra purchase. When and how will I get billed? Anyone know? I just received the official email from Samsung the other day saying I positively received my $425 trade-in credit for my Samsung Note 10+ phone. Thanks.	N

The S22 Ultra S-View Flip Cover has a magnet that interferes with the s pen	"I've been using this case for a little while now and I've noticed that when it's laid open, the s pen works normally. However, when the front cover is flipped back, there is a small patch in the lower right corner of the screen which has trouble recognizing the s pen. 
There's no magnet holding the case closed, but I believe that the small circular indentation on the inside of the screen cover is a magnet. When flipped back, this lines up with the area that won't register. Magnetic cases have caused this issue with past Note phones. 
Has anyone else noticed this, or could confirm? Touch inputs work fine either way, but using the s pen to draw over that area when the screen is flipped will turn a line into a series of dots as it constantly deregisters."	N
Phantom alarm appearing in KWGT widget for upcoming alarm, created by S Pen app.	"If you use the widget app KWGT, and experiencing a phantom alarm showing up in next alarms on a widget you created, the issue lies with the S Pen app adding a alarm.
I posted how to remove this alarm on the Kustom sub-reddit, which I'll paste the contents of that post below.
&amp;#x200B;
I  recently changed phones to a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. After installing  my apps, and custom KWGT widgets, I noticed a phantom alarm appearing  on my widget for the upcoming alarm display. The alarm set itself 9  hours ahead of the current time.
Oh  man, I thought, this is going to be a nightmare to figure out what is  adding this alarm. I figured it was probably a system app, since I did  not have this alarm appear on my old phone, which was a Galaxy Note 20  Ultra.
Well, I finally figured out where the phantom alarm is coming from...
# THE S PEN APP
There  you have it. If you're experiencing the same issue as me, and have a  Galaxy S22 Ultra. Your S Pen app is adding an alarm. It appears Samsung  did an amateurish hacky solution to get their app to function by having  it add an alarm for whatever function they need it to do.
# SOLUTION
I found how to stop the alarm from appearing, however it will eat up some battery power.
To  stop the alarm from appearing, pull out your S Pen.  The S Pen app  screen will appear. In the lower left corner, tap the setting gear. Look  for the section titled ""Keep S Pen connected"" and enable this setting.
There  you have it. The phantom alarm will disappear, but according to  Samsung, enabling that setting will eat up some battery life.
Hope this helps anyone trying to figure out this issue.
I'll  look into submitting a bug report to Samsung requesting they find  another workaround to having an alarm set for their S Pen functions.

S22 Ultra battery life does get better	"I've had my S22u for 11 days l now and I was so disappointed with the initial battery life. I've seen a lot of conversations on here recently, with some people saying it should get better and others saying it definitely doesn't. So I just wanted to make this post as reassurance to those who may be feeling the same as I was last week. 
In the last 13 hours I've gotten 3h 15m screen on time and 9h 45m screen off time and I'm sitting at 52%. That's a massive improvement from last week when I was charging twice a day, and barely getting 4h screen on time. 
I'm an exynos device and I've mostly been using for messaging, social media, light gaming and a few YouTube videos.

Canadian's who preordered the Online Exclusive S22 Ultra	Has any Canadian at all received their phone yet. Mar 2nd was my expected delivery date, but I am still on "Customizing" on the site. I did however get the "How are you enjoying your s22 ultra" email, so thats nice.	N
S22 ultra preorder expected delivery	"I pre ordered my s22ultra from a reputable dealer in Australia-jbhifi 
When pre ordering the phone they confirmed that stock was ordered and they could allocate one to me.
Confirmed with the retailer yesterday that it was ready for collection and was told that they had my phone but had to wait until today 4/3 for the release date to pick it up.
Went to collect my order and was told it's not available for at least another 2 weeks.
Has anyone else had any similar issues?
Has anyone in Australia managed to get an s22 Ulta?"	N
I pre-ordered S22 Ultra and received a defective phone. I will lose pre-order promotions if I "exchange" it.	"I pre-ordered Galaxy S22 Ultra 512GB because there were two major promotions: free storage upgrade and $250 Samsung Store credit. (important!)
I received the phone and realized there is a smudge at the screen that won't erase, i.e. screen imperfection. I decided to get it exchanged but soon realized Samsung no longer exchanges phone and instead have to return and reorder the phone. This is where everything starts to go wrong.
I contacted customer service center and see if I can receive an additional refund because I now need to pay more for the same storage (I got 512GB for the price of 256GB) and give up my $250 store credit I am supposed to receive. The staff told me they will issue an additional refund for the lost store credit but they will not do anything regarding free storage upgrade promotion.
There are two options at this point: keep use my defective phone, receive a new phone with part of my promotion taken away, or get a free screen repair under manufacture warranty even before actually using it. My question is: Why did Samsung decide to stop exchanging defective product?! My life just got so much more difficult because I have to return and reorder it. What should I do at this point?"	N
Note 20 Ultra S-Pen for S22 Ultra?	"So I heard people are getting colorful note 20 and note 10 s-pens for the S22 since the size is same. My question is that delay decrease samsung did from 9ms to 2.8ms, is that the s-pen or the phone? because if it's the s-pen, then I would be downgrading.
Any help appreciated. :)"	N
S22 vs s22+ battery life?	Has anyone compared the two? Just curious if the 4500mah battery of the s22+ makes for a significant difference in battery life between the two? The s22+ battery is of course powering a larger and brighter screen than the s22.	N
Underscreen fingerprint scanner on S22 Ultra seems way faster through a screen protector compared to Note 20	"I pressed in on the fingerprint scanner while applying the screen protector as well, I am using a whitestone dome screen protector. 
Anyone else using whitestone? I highly recommend them as I don't ever have to think about taking it off, I had one protector last two years without degrading much at all."	N
Gimbal for S22 Ultra?	"I've been looking for a gimbal for video, and looking at what's available, I keep seeing conflicting reports on whether the dji om 5 can handle 230 grams.  Some people say it works fine and others say it almost immediately craps out with lots saying it at least overstrains the motor.
I don't want to spend $500 on an rsc 2 when it's probably due for a third gen soon and I worry about how good the smartphone gimbals from feiyu and zhiyun that say they support 280-300 grams actually are when finding actually discerning reviews of them is even harder than dji's stuff."	N
Why your Samsung S22 or S21 any Samsung phone perform badly?	"  Hi,
I received many questions from people why my S22 performance is worst than Poco X3 Pro ? Why my Citra Emulator won't start?
If you are tech geek here is explanation
Main point why all Samsung phones Qualcomm and Exynos even with AMD RDNA2 performance is bad because of current cap.
Let me explain...
On PC we have TDP for max power draw but on mobile we use current as measure most phones doesn't have any cap as TDP.
That why your Mi 12 is so hot is using 24W to do AnTuTu benchmarks!
If you want latest and Greatest tech don't buy anything with SD888 and SD8G1, wait for SD8G1+ from TSCM 4-3nm node the same as Apple A16 which is already at production and is scheduled to release in Q2-Q3 2022
Samsung phones has 1000ma current cap in short 4W-5W TDP cap so any benchmarks can't be compere to Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 for Example Mi 12 which can use up to 5000ma current up to 24W.
Yes All Qualcomm chip on other phone can use up to 20W of Power Most SD8G1 And SD888 because of inefficiency of Samsung manufacturing node. Yes TSCM is better and SD865 and SD870 have only power draw of max 10W of power and SD865 with GLU OC 14-15W compere to SD888 22W.
This is only stress test data but if you want real world example Genshin Impact max settings 60fps
SD888 58-59 fps Average with Active cooling 11W on average peaks to 15W (Golder reviewer in Lenovo phone has similar power consumption )
SD865 in Mi 10T with GPU OC 7A on Average 9-10W peak power consumption Exynos 2200 doesn't have OpenGL drivers at all. If you
look at CPU-Z on Android show ANGLE (Vulkan..... )
It is using Project Angle to translate all OpenGL to Vulkan.
Vulkan is only good way of testing that. Nobody cares and testing Genshin Impact with OpenGL which isn't good and not Vulkan in hidden settings.
So your Citra Emulator won't work if developer won't
update it to compatible with Project Angle from Google.
If you don't believe me install CGB overlay it is rootless and see your current wouldn't go above -1000ma."	N
S22 Ultra Issues - UK based	"hi guys, I am from the UK and i find it annoying that my phone usually hangs when i try to unlock, i need the screen to timeout before i can re-attempt to unlock the phone. Is it possible to return my phone to Samsung and ask for a cash back? London based here. 
PS : i tried factory reset and it seems the problem is with OneUI since sometimes it gaves me a status that One UI is not responding.
I somehow wanting to change to iphone now."	N
S22 Opinion form an outsider	"I recently had to upgrade from a Sony Xperia XZ1 compact. Sony doesn't sell phones in Canada anymore so my two options were Samsung Galaxy and Google Pixel for an upgrade. 
Pixel had a lots of reviews for bad fingerprint reader and mixed reviews on the software. 
Reading reviews here, the Galaxy S22 seems like a good alternative that met most of my needs; ie. smaller phone, good camera, battery life. 
TL:DR - the Sony was a better phone for usability.
The long of it: Size is great, screen looks way better, the pictures have better resolution. Huge down side is the battery, it last a full day, 16 hours, but I was used to having 50% battery at the end of that time. 
I take a lot of pictures for work and the color accuracy on the S22 photos is not good. It has been 2 weeks and I can't quite get it adjusted right. Brown looks orange, green will look yellow. I have to describe the colours when sending a picture to someone else. Typically this is for wiring so the photos are close up and with flash. The samsung pro picture mode is close but doesn't have as much control as the sony did. 
Selfie camera on the Sony was much better, but it also had a much larger sensor. The green camera light is a nice touch on the S22. 
Sony automation on the phone was quite a bit better. You can essentially take any setting and change it depending on time or network connections. As far as I can tell you need to download IFTTT to do the same on the samsung. Small one I notices was sony will use your alarm clock to time when it charges your battery to full, I was surprised to see samsung doesn't have the same feature. 
The finger print scanner on the samsung times out enough that I don't think it really works. The Pixel must be terrible because I would classify the S22 fingerprint scanner as not working. The sony fingerprint scanner needed a hole in the case to work, but it actually worked 100% of the time. 
Not having a headphone jack or SD card slot I probably could have gotten over if it didn't seem like the rest of the phone was inconvenient to use sometimes. The one UI isn't really doing it for me and I am probably going to get a custom launcher anyways. Speakers are not quite as good when showing a video to another person, but the screen is double the size so that kind of makes up for it. 
I am sure I have lots to learn about the phone but buyers remorse is putting a damper on things right now. Anyone in the USA want to trade for a Xperia 5 III?"	N

Skinned Google Messages	"I wish I had the ability to have the same options I have on my Pixel 6 Pro and Google Messages. I love how on P6P the messages has a sort feature on the main screen(all,personal,business), I miss the iPhone emojis working(no more ""? liked this"") and the ability to send videos without losing quality via the Google Photos link. These may appear to be insignificant if you have never had these features but you do miss them when you have had them 
Not sure why Sammy chose to skin the app."	N

The boxy design of the ultra I love a lot."	N
Auto on wifi	Hi, just upgraded from a Note 8 to the S22 Ultra. On my old phone I enabled auto-on wifi even with location turned off and it still works turning the wifi on and off when I left and enter the network. The S22 Ultra wants me to turn on location services to toggle the auto-on wifi on, which I did, but I turned the services back off and it still shows it enabled. But it is darkened and can't toggle it back off. Will it still work with location services off? The Eye Comfort Shield works with the services off, but the auto on wifi seems to keep the wifi on after leaving my network. Would Bixby routines be an option without the need to turn on location services?	N
My First Samsung	"Believe it or not the 22 Ultra is my first Samsung smart phone - ever. I've had nothing but Motos up to this point (Atrix, all the X's, Edge). It's been a big adjustment but in a good way, since I love playing around with settings, which is why I love Android in the first place. The more stuff I discover on my burgundy beauty the more I really love it. The only thing I can honestly say I truly miss from my Moto is the always on display. Everything else - the reliable Bluetooth connection, beautiful screen, camera etc. - is just so much better. 
To be fair I paid a heck of a lot more for this phone than I did my Edge, but I got tired of the mediocre camera. If you want the best camera that means Apple, Google or Samsung. I love my iPad but have never had a yen to get an iPhone. I'm surrounded by a sea of them at work so I know how great they are, but I will always prefer Android."	N
AOD trick	"Hi all. I discovered a little hack for the AOD. It's for those people who want a bare minimum AOD with just the fingerprint icon and battery percentage and notifications and nothing else-no clock, date etc.  
Firstly, turn on AOD and set your schedule, (always on, tap to show or scheduled time). Then set your brightness to manual or auto brightness. If you don't select a clock, a default one will be set.  
Go to then, ""show fingerprint icon"" and activate that.  
Go then to Good Lock and download and open clock face. Select AOD for clock selection. And browse any clock that has colours in it. It has to be a clock with colours.  
Select a clock and then you have the options to adjust colours for the clock numbers or indices, clock hands, clock pin and day/date. For each of these items, press on the multicolour icon and select black for each item. 
Save that clock as your AOD and your AOD display will be nothing but the fingerprint icon and battery percentage. You also get notifications on this AOD without the clock and day/date. 
Alternatively, you can set up the AOD to have nothing as an AOD but still show notifications so that you don't miss them. Simply follow the steps as above but omit the ""show fingerprint icon"" step. You will technically have an AOD that is almost all black except for the battery percentage, but will display notifications. You can still double tap for the lockscreen or learn where to place your finger above the battery percentage to press the fingerprint sensor."	N
Extra Brightness	Wow the extra brightness is outstanding i can actually see my dark theme text , web all dark themed and extra brightness enabled i can definitely see really good in the sun, don't need to put the adaptive brightness.	N

For anyone planning on installing a whitedome	"Just wanted to shair my experience and give some tips. I did my first install when my preorder came and my fingerprint sensor was hit or miss, it would constantly tell me to push harder or cover the whole screen. I followed whitestones instructional video perfectly and reregistered my finger prints after install and turned on increased sensitivity (idk if this helps with the fingerprint scanner or not) and even added the same finger multiple times, sometimes it worked quick sometimes not at all. Well today thanks to my stupid pockets my phone took a face first dive onto my metal bedframe and it cracked my glass protector. Screen was fine but I did a new install since the crack was spreading. 
New install I did some stuff different. This time after doing the initial 15 sec cure to tack the protector on I pressed hard right where the scanner is for about 15 secs as well and then immediately hit that section with the 60 sec cure. I did the top portion, then I did the middle portion, and then pushed one more time on the finger scanner and cured again. After this I did about 5 more cures on the top, middle, and bottom of the screen. Now my scanner works like there isn't a screen protector on at all. I hope this helps someone planning on doing an install or someone currently having issues. 
TLDR: Scanner didn't work on first install, when I reinstalled I pressed hard on the scanner right after the first 15 sec cure and then cured for more time than they say it needs. No more issues."	N

Connecting S22U to PC (Windows 10/11)	Has anyone been having the issue of your s22 not being recognized at all by your PC? I installed the latest Samsung drivers, put my phone in debug mode and set the default USB to file transfer but still nothing and this was on multiple computers but my note 10+ works fine	N
Camera: We need a Sport modus with a shutter speed limit at the lower end.	"At least I need that, but if more would request such a feature..
Problem is, moving subjects and low shutter speed don't produce good photos.
And typically during action there is no time for manual settings.
So a mode where the camera never exceeds a low shutter speed limit (ideally set by the user) and raises Iso to keep above the limit, **but users faster speeds of course if there is enough light**, would make it perfect. Of course that should work across all cameras and shoot raw.
So let's all tell Samsung that this is a needed feature in smartphone photography and make it the best brand available. As this would be an industry leading new feature. Regular cameras do it, but I know of no smartphone software that does.
**Please note why this is not Manual or Pro Mode:** While 1/250th with ISO 800 works well in the shadows, it just overexposes once the ISO reaches its lower limit at ISO 25 in the sun and the shutterspeed still being fixed at 1/250th, or when switching between different camera modules, while 1/250th is fine on the dark tele lens it overexposes on the main with the F1.8 opening. Its better than nothing, but far from a quick point to shoot mode."	N

Whitestone dome screen protector review (ultra)	"Just wanted to put my review out there about the Whitestone dome screen protector since I noticed the reviews were kind of all over the place. Some people swear by them and say they are the best protectors ever and I've seen others say the complete opposite. After doing it myself I would say most negative reviews are from people not following the directions properly since there are a lot more steps compared to typical protectors.
This was my first time trying any Whitestone product so I had zero experience with the install process. If I'm being honest I was definitely a little nervous going into it because it seemed complicated but trust me it was not as bad as I thought it was going to be. Overall it took me about 25 minutes and now that I've done it once I could probably do it in half the time. Best thing I did was watch a YouTube video of someone installing on the s22 ultra. I watched it once all of the way through before trying and then followed along step by step while doing my own install. 
Make sure you do the install in a well lit and clean area with little airflow. That way you can see and smudges or dust that are on the screen. Take your time cleaning your phone and do a final dust check before applying the adhesive. With everything they give you to assist in the install process it couldn't have been any easier. 
Overall it feels a lot more premium than the cheaper options I've used in the past. The glass looks and feels smoother and has a more solid feel to it. When my phone is on you can barely tell it is even there and the fingerprint sensor works just as good as it did without the protector. I had to redo my fingerprints but that's normal with any screen protector. It also fits perfectly in my spigen liquid air case. Other cheaper protectors have not always worked with cases in the past. My only complaint is that up near the front facing camera and on some parts near the edge of the screen I can see a sort of rainbow effect when I tilt the phone at certain angles. It's not noticeable enough to warrant taking the protector off but it is there. Could have been an install error or it could be that's the way it is. Either way I would reccomend giving it a try if you have not in the past. I will update if anything changes in the coming weeks/months."	N

Anyone else moved from S9 to S22?	"How do you like your change? I'm debating the upgrade since my S9 has really slowed down over the past few years, battery has worn out a bit, and 64 gb of internal just doesn't feel enough. It's also not 5G compatible.
But I will really miss certain things such as the rear fingerprint reader for multiple reasons: feels more ergonomic, I occasionally use that notch to have a better grip, and I liked using the reader to drop down the top menu.
I will also really miss the Bixby button which I could program to do various things such as turn on my flashlight, change me from 'normal' to 'vibrate' sound profile, and do a few other functions such as start/stop my voice recorder.
I also realize that I'm getting a good $225 with Samsung trade-in... and that with any upgrade there will be features that will be different and I'll just have to get used to the new phone.

Samsung S22 Shipment Delay in Indonesia	"Hi reddit, 
I don't know where should I complain regarding this issue because there are lots of customer complaining on all Samsung Official accounts (e-commerce. instagram, twitter, even on offline stores) but yet there is no official statement regarding why there is delay on shipment of the new Samsung Galaxy S22 (this is happening on all S22 type, S22, S22+ and ultra). 
&amp;#x200B;
For customers who preorder during the preorder period (10 February 2022 - 1 March 2022) in all platform that Samsung Indonesia provides are not getting their phones until today and yet Samsung hasn't give any official statement regarding this delay. We also don't know when we are going to get our S22. When we call  Samsung customer service, they know nothing about this issue and says that the Samsung stores should know the info. When we ask the stores, they said that they haven't got any info from Samsung office. 
&amp;#x200B;
We as customers who are doing the pre order feels like we are getting scammed by Samsung and we don't know where we should ask for information regarding this issue. Some people says that we should wait until March 25. As for myself, I don't know if this information is true or not. Until I write this on Reddit, there is no news, and no statement anywhere while people all over the world are enjoying the Samsung S22
&amp;#x200B;
TLDR; We haven't get S22 here in Indonesia"	N
S22 Ultra, Exynos. Can't make phone calls.	"S22 Ultra 12/256, Exynos model. Phone is working good... but I can't make phone calls, with neither of the 2 SIMs I'm using (2 different carriers as well). Actually I can make phone calls, but they will last 1 or 2 seconds (with very low quality), then the phone will automatically end the call.
For some reason, the only moment when I can actually make phone calls without problem is just after rebooting the phone. Then it will stop working properly again.
I'm trying to reset the phone to see if this can fix my issue, before sending the phone to repair. 😟
Is anyone experiencing the same problem?
Thank you."	N

My Exynos S22 base's battery drains 34% overnight from 7 hours of idle standby	"[Album of battery usage screen](https://imgur.com/a/8wGhGFF)
I recently upgraded to the base S22 Exynos from a Note9 Exynos, and while I absolutely adore this device, the battery life, especially the idle drain, is very frustrating. It drained an extra 34% of battery after 9 minutes of active use and 7 hours and 9 minutes of idle use:
| Time               | Battery % | Screen on time | Screen off time |
|------------------|------------|------------------|------------------|
| 2022-03-26 00:06 | 56%       | 00:41          | 03:47           |
| 2022-03-26 07:20 | 23%       | 00:50          | 10:56           |
I've had this phone for for less than 3 days now, and while I understand that the phone may take some time to optimize to my usage patterns, I feel this level of drain is unacceptable. Especially when I downloaded and use only a handful of additional apps with no gaming, with most of my apps being FOSS apps from F-droid or stock Samsung apps. 
My relevant setting details:
* Charge level capped to 85% from protect battery setting
* Adaptive battery: On
* Processing speed: Optimized
* Adaptive power saving: On
* Super fast charging: On (Using official 25W charger)
* Fast wireless charging: On (Using official Samsung duo wireless charger)
* Dark mode: On
* Adaptive brightness: On
* Motion smoothness: Adaptive
* Eye comfort shield: Sunset to sunrise
* Screen mode: Vivid
* Bluetooth: On
* NFC: Off
* Location: Off
* VoLTE: On
* Wi-Fi Calling: On
* Network mode: 4G/3G/2G (auto connect)
* Wi-Fi power saving mode: On
I imagine that the idle drain is related to data usage, so I made a Bixby routine to turn off mobile data when I'm connected to my home Wi-Fi network. I'm trying this out as of this morning, and it seems to improve my idle battery drain so far. But this is still not really a true fix, as not using mobile data is not really an acceptable work-around for a smartphone. 
Another thing I noticed is that one of the apps I have to use (KakaoTalk) occasionally gives a pop-up of unstable network connection, and that may be resulting in the app actively trying to establish connection in the background, resulting in the high idle battery drain. This can't be confirmed in my battery usage screenshots, but if the above attempt doesn't work, I will try putting the app in question into deep sleep and see if that has any impact. 
Aside from idle battery drain issue, as you can see from my third screenshot, my phone was also at 14% after 1:55 of screen on time yesterday, after navigating around with Google Maps for one hour. I understand navigation is tough on the battery, but the phone basically dying after using navigation for one hour is hardly a usable device.
I really want to love this device. It's everything I've wanted in a phone except for the battery life. Have any other base S22 users seen similar issues with their devices, particularly the Exynos versions?"	N

Samsung service is terrible	"I  recently received my new Galaxy S22 Ultra. Unfortunatley it has a  problem with the screen. When you tilt the phone and look at it from an  angle, it has a weird green color shift. If you look directly at the  screen, everything looks fine. You can see the problem here: [https://imgur.com/a/lYmPP5g](https://imgur.com/a/lYmPP5g)
I  contacted Samsung after noticing the problem on Wednesday. I also sent  them pictures of the color shift and a video. I didn't hear anything  back from them until Saturday. I wouldn't mind waiting that long if I  got a good and helpful response. But what they sent after 3 days is  beyond me. They advised me to restart the phone and if that doesn't  work, reset it to factory settings.
Here is the answer I received (translated by deepl):
&gt;Thank you for contacting SAMSUNG Electronics Switzerland. You have a green tint in the display. I will be happy to help you.I am happy to receive your e-mail.I  recommend that you first perform a forced restart by holding down the  Power button and the Quiet button for about 7 seconds.The unit will shut  down and restart on its own.If this does not bring any changes, then  reset your device to factory settings.If  you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.  Were you satisfied with this service? Then I am happy about your  positive rating with a simple click at the end of this email.
It  is clearly a hardware defect that cannot be fixed by restarting the  phone. Are they really that clueless or is this just a standard response  they send to every customer?
&amp;#x200B;
EDIT: Thank you very much for all your replies. I thought I had a defective unit because my Galaxy S20 5G has much better viewing angles than my S22 Ultra and almost no color shoft no matter how extereme the angle. I didn't know that this was normal for the Galaxy S22 Ultra, sorry.

Unfortunately every review I can find compares Ultra to Ultra which doesn't help me."	N
Fold 3 vs. S22U for those interested	"Here is an in depth personal comparison between the Fold 3 and S22U.
&amp;#x200B;
First let me start out by saying that before the Fold 3 I was an Apple fanboy. Iphone user since the original, and Apple could do absolutely no wrong in my eyes. Over the years I tried many Android devices to try to break away from Apple, but I always found myself within 2 weeks going back. The Fold 3 is different, and I don't see myself ever owning a non-foldable android device ever again. In fact, when I put away my Fold 3 to use the S22U as my primary... I started missing my iPhone. That went right away when I came back to the Fold. There is **ONE** thing about the S22U that I love and will address that at the end.
&amp;#x200B;
Now if that paragraph didn't give it away then yes, I have returned the S22U after just a little over a week use. While there were a very few things I liked more on it, the S22U couldn't hold a candle to the Fold 3 for me... and this is why:
&amp;#x200B;
First the obvious, the **wow factor**. This is what stole me away from Apple. The gorgeous inner screen that still months later is just satisfying to open and close. I know everyone knows this already, but the capabilities of this screen are endless. For years we have been calling these smartphones ""pocket computers"". The Fold is the true definition of a pocket computer. Multitasking, media and pretty much everything looks amazing on the inner display. Even just scrolling through apps is more enjoyable
&amp;#x200B;
This will be shocking to most, but the **SPEN** is next. The built in factor is great but the size is just awkward to write with or use. The SPEN for the Fold is the perfect size and for me the Thin Fit P case makes it as good as it needs to be. Honestly, if the SPEN is built in on the Fold 4 that will be a bit of a disappointment for me. Not a dealbreaker by any means but that would mean the size of the pen would have to be trimmed down tremendously which will make it annoying to use and not as fun.
&amp;#x200B;
**Camera** wise I was expecting to be blown away by the S22U... I wasn't. I am sure a software update will help but this made me realize even more that the cameras on the Fold are not that bad. Images and videos are pretty much identical on both phones and low light actually looks better and more natural on the Fold 3. The **ONE** thing I like about the S22U more is the zoomed in focus feature. I have never seen such a great quality image on a phone when zoomed in. I can't remember of the mode you turn on for it but it is incredible how clear and focused it makes whatever your zoomed in on.
&amp;#x200B;
The **speakers** probably are one of the biggest frustrations for me and I would think for most people on the S22U. The placement is absolutely HORRIBLE. To the left of the charging port is where you'll find the speaker and there is no comfortable way to hold the phone and watch or listen to media and it sound as good as it should. My hand covers most of the speaker when holding it two handed and with a device of this size not many people can hold this beast one handed. The speakers on the Fold 3 are the best speakers I have had on a phone in my life. Even setting the level to 50 is enough for most situations. Everything sounds so crisp and clear and having a speaker on the top and the bottom of the device is a big part of that surround sound feel it gives off.
&amp;#x200B;
**Comfortability and everyday usage** is just better with the Fold. This is an issue with every other smartphone as well the but the S22U is big...FREAKISHLY BIG. The display is beautiful and colors pop on the S22U but that is just not enough to overcome the inconveniences this causes. The Fold 3 is the first phone in a while that I can use one handed and I don't think I will ever want to go back to not being able to do that. Everything is reachable on the outer screen and of course if I want more space and need to handle a task that requires two hands and a bigger display? Well the Fold has that too. Although the Fold 3 is thicker... ALOT thicker it still fits way better in pockets and is more discreet. Again, I am sure some people will love the form and size of the S22U but for me these inconveniences are too much to handle and the size of the Fold is preferred.
Now for the one thing that the S22U has that the Fold 3 doesn't and honestly was probably the biggest reason I wanted to try the S22U even though it wasn't enough to keep me from going back to the Fold.
&amp;#x200B;
**Battery:** I know a lot of people will say it's not that bad but coming from an iPhone and now using the S22U... The Fold 3 battery is bad... months later I am still trying to find ways to save battery whereas with the iPhone and S22U I just didn't have to. I am a heavy power user and the S22U always had battery left by the end of my day. At work when it wasn't getting much use the battery barely dropped in standby. When in use I would time that it would take almost 15 minutes just to drop 1%. The Fold 3 simply can't compete and incredibly inconsistent. Some days my battery is good, others not so much. I use my phone pretty much the same way everyday and even timing the drop times between percentages were incredibly inconsistent all while running the same application which doesn't play any media.  I am hoping the reports are false as the Fold 4 NEEDS a battery improvement. It will be extremely disappointing if they include an SPEN and because of that either have to drop the battery capacity or keep it the same. 
The Fold is my new iPhone so to speak. I do not see myself ever going back to a slab phone or even Apple when or if they ever make a foldable phone. Does it need some improvements? Of course. The cameras could definitely be better (iPhone 13 Pro Max quality or how the S22U really should look) and the battery needs a huge improvement (S22U battery is more than enough). This is already the greatest smart phone you can get today, these 2 improvements would push it even further above the rest."	N
Swapped to an S22U and now I'm swapping back, and here's why. (and whether or not you should do it if you are considering the upgrade)	"I've been a huge Fold user since the release of the Fold2 (never had a chance to get the OG Fold), swapped to the Fold 3 as soon as it came out and have been very very happy with it. But there is one area that has always annoyed me about it, despite what people here will say, the camera's are very old and I take a lot of pictures with my phone. They aren't crap by any means, but they aren't modern. 
&amp;#x200B;
So when the S22U came out I decided to go ahead and grab one and see if I liked it better or if I missed the Fold a lot, and long story short, I missed the Fold a ton for the 1 week I've used to the S22U, and IMO the S22U is just not good enough to justify the ""upgrade"". So for those of you that have been posting here about considering the S22U, I would say no, don't do it. 
&amp;#x200B;
First and foremost, lets be totally clear, the S22U is an upgrade in almost every single way over the Fold 3 on paper, faster CPU, brighter display, higher PPI, better cameras, S Pen built in, etc.... But, lets be honest, a huge number of those things aren't a big enough upgrade for even a mobile gamer to really notice.  There are a handful that matter IMO though, and I will address each below.
&amp;#x200B;
The S Pen being included is HUGE, I personally can't stand the fact that the Fold 3 doesn't have an S Pen built in, and all the case designs to hold it with you on the go are just crap, like lets be honest, they make an already bulky phone too bulky. I know some people might be ok with that but I'm not. I personally love using the S Pen, but not having it built in is a huge killer for me and a big part of why I got the S22U to try for a week. But I've also found that I don't ""need"" it most of the time so I'm personally OK with not having it built in as a downside (though I still really want the next fold to have a built in one)
&amp;#x200B;
The brighter display on the S22U is nice, up to 1750 nits is actually insane, while out and about in the sun in my car, with sunglasses on, I found that I had to still keep the brightness BELOW max because it was so bright. This, in my opinion, is as bright as a smartphone display will ever need to be. BUT the 900 ish nits that the Fold 3 can put out is no joke either and is still plenty for almost all situations. I'll admit the softer display does for sure show fingerprints and reflections a little worse out in the sun, so the S22U takes the win here for sure but the Fold 3 is once again not bad. 
&amp;#x200B;
The better cameras, if I'm being honest this is the #1 reason I wanted to give the S22U a shot, and at the same time is the #1 disappointment to me. We are talking a near 4 year leap in camera tech, and if I'm being honest I expected a lot more, the cameras between the 2 are almost impossible to tell apart unless you bring zoom into count, and so far in the dark the Fold 3 has actually been way more accurate to real life colors. Both clearly share the same color science, and in the best of the best lighting, the S22U for sure wins, and it's always sharper at least by a little, but it's not enough of an improvement to be losing the folding display. If I'm being totally honest the real world photos out of Samsung and Pixel's are a great disappointment to what my iPhone 13 users are getting. In reviews they always seem comparable but in pictures I've seen doing side by side testing in low light, of moving things, animals, outdoors, etc.... the iPhone always looks way better and a lot less processed/fuzzy IMO. Don't get me wrong though, the zoom on the S22U is INSANE, it's like no other and could be totally worth it for some people, especially if you do a lot of outdoor photos.
&amp;#x200B;
The battery on the S22U is just stupid good, the best of any Android phone I've used other than back in the day when you could put an extended battery inside a phone (talking Galaxy S6 days with ZeroLemon 10k mAh lol, those were the days). The Fold 3 still is *almost* a full day for me 100% of the time, I'd say maybe 90% of the time I don't have to charge it part way through the day. But for a heavy user like me, I can say the S22U would get me through a full day basically 100% of the time even on my absolute heaviest of days, this is something I really appreciate about it. I know many people say they just charge in their car or at their desk if they can't get a full day out of it, but my argument against that is that it's not good for the longevity of the battery, I'd much rather have a charge it once per day phone than a sometimes twice per day phone, especially if I'm using fast charging for that second time in the day. 
&amp;#x200B;
Now, before I address some of the better things about the Fold that were brought to light, I want to address one huge failure on the S22U, that for me is, would have been a dealbreaker despite all the other points I've made above. This is very very personal, but definitely won't be a just me problem either, the speaker placement is awful. It's on the bottom left of the phone, and when I two hand a phone like this to type, I rest my pinky (both actually) on the bottom to hold the phone. In doing so, there is about a 50% chance I cover up the speaker and muffle it like crazy. This is mostly an issue when typing (which is what I spend maybe 50% or more of my time on my phone doing), it sounds like it'd be no big deal, but having your keyboard sounds go muffled to unmuffled back and forth can really trip up your typing, as a keyboard enthusiast myself, sound plays a huge part in it, and having that happen makes the phone in some ways almost unusable. 
&amp;#x200B;
OK, so the Fold 3, other than the super obvious of having a huge display and a wow factor, has some things going for it that the S22U doesn't, things that I think are important to address. 
&amp;#x200B;
The speakers, wow the freaking speakers, the S22U has great speakers but nothing compares to the Fold 3. I always knew they were good, but here we are with another flagship a year later and still it feels way behind in comparison to the Fold 3. The bass is super lacking, the earpiece speaker while louder is nothing like having 2 balanced identical speakers on each side, and if you crank it all the way it's still quieter than the Fold 3 and is clearly louder than these little speakers should ever be driven anyway (they distort a lot). 
&amp;#x200B;
Durability, which isn't really something I thought I'd be bringing up when writing this, but it's clear the Fold 3 is built like a tank and I think it stands a much higher chance of surviving drops, EVEN on the outer display which is still glass (of course it would take an insane drop to break the inner display since it's flexible). The bezels are so much larger around both displays on this phone that I'm confident it'd survive a pretty bad drop. Of course the Fold 3 does fall flat in one area here, the scratch resistance of the inner display. I've since removed my screen protector and have 2 small scratches on the inner display that bug me, they aren't noticeable while it's in use other than on all white backgrounds, but I still hate that it's scratched when I've been so careful with it. However, scree replacements aren't too expensive and I imagine the Fold 4 will be around before this one is bad enough for me to care. 
&amp;#x200B;
Wow factor is also another one, no matter how much we like to pretend to be humble, us tech nerds like to show off our tech, and the Fold 3 gets people talking whereas the S22U just won't, it's nothing unique design wise, just another slab phone. 
&amp;#x200B;
Comfort is the final thing I'll touch on, the Fold 3 is just easier to hold, whether it's making a phone call folded up, or using it two handed, I don't feel cramped on it since I can use it 2 handed without my fingers touching. And when it's folded up it's much more comfortable to hold in a single hand. And this IMO is a huge benefit of the fold, you've got the outer display for single handed use, and the inner display for 2 handed use. Whereas any other slab phone you'll generally get the worst of both worlds, too big for one hand, but too small for 2 handed use. 
&amp;#x200B;
Now, if Samsung wants to make the Fold 4 the best phone ever, I think there is a couple key things they can do. Put the S22U camera system on it (or whatever the S23 will have if they really wanna do a good job), include an S Pen, and somehow make the battery even bigger on it. This, in my view, would be hands down the best phone out there."	N

FirstNet - All Galaxy S22 U1 models are now in the IMEI whitelist	"In Local Control they now show as FirstNet certified and will provision for VoLTE, RCS, WiFi Calling, 5G, Hotspot, VVM, and Video Calling.
**You must perform the ATT sim swap while still being on the unlocked U1 firmware that the phone shipped with, and then flash U firmware, in that order, you cannot skip this step. I have a full guide here.**

This is about as easy as it's ever going to get, but at least you no longer have to call in and get them to manually push through your IMEI."	N
Is my new unlocked S22+ defective? Extremely slow data on T-Mobile network	Ordered directly from Samsung to replace my old S9+ Since say one I'm experiencing an issue with data speeds. My download speeds are a joke between 1.5 and 2.5 Mbps. Any video streaming through the youtube app or browser is extremely glitchy and unusable with constant buffering. Called T-Mobile who performed a reset on their end, checked my settings and said there's nothing more they can do. Tried calling Samsung but after a 2 hour hold, was transferred to another rep, then disconnected. Wondering whether my new phone is defective or if this could be due to the S22 being an unlocked version, not a T-Mobile branded one which is what my old S9+ was. Anyone with similar issues?	N
Samsung S22 Device Unlock Time?	"I bought my S22 directly from Samsung and got the T-Mobile version.  Naturally it was locked, so I requested the device IMEI be put on the Device Distribution Inventory System so I could unlock it.  I also provided a fully-paid-off receipt from Samsung.
I did this on Tuesday.  How long does this usually take these days?  I keep trying the Permanent Unlock but get Code 116 (not eligible).
Thanks!"	N
S22 Ultra 1 TB Phantom Black promised delivery date	"Hi there,
Are there more people extremely frustrated by the promises made by Samsung?
Ordered the S22 Ultra 1 TB Phantom Black on 16:17 CEST (17 minutes into that presentation), still my order is set on the first status 'ordered',  Ships: February 24, 2022 , yet nothing from Samsung.
I called the 'Customer service', they told me a batch had already arrived and shipped to people who ordered AFTER me and now they are waiting till a new delivery of phones. No fixed dates, no compensation, nothing."	N
S22 ultra pre order concern	"I placed an pre-order for my galaxy s22 ultra 256 blue unlocked on day of the announcement. I'm waiting for update on when my device will ship. On the website it says deliver by 4-6 weeks, is that time frame from pre-order or exact launch date?
I also noticed some inconsistency dates between my order status page on the web and my devices. On Samsung.com my order status shows fast, no date or anything for shipping. On my pixel 6 Samsung app it shows delivery by April 8th and on my iphone it says March 8th, anyone else experience this inconsistency? 
Hope my phone comes in real soon lol 😂"	N
My S22 Ultra Battery Life Improved!	"To those of you struggling with battery life, I assure you, it gets better and incredibly sudden.
My S22 Ultra would barely get through the day on what I consider normal use (social media, light gaming, YouTube etc)
It's now been turned on for around 5 hours, been doing all that as usual and the phone currently sits at 74% - when I first got it, it would of already been down to 50%
Has anyone else seen such crazy improvements?
I did also just get the update a few days ago to the March Security Patch, not sure if that did something."	N
How is the performance on S22 Ultra (Exynos!)?	"Right now I have a iPhone XS Max but it’s getting slow and storage is almost full. I can get the s22 ultra for €850 so it’s really tempting to switch because for the same price you have a iPhone 13 lol. 
I read a lot of story’s that the performance on the exynos is terrible. Also the camera and battery life is worse than snapdragon. So can people who have the exynos tell their experience right now (after the latest updates)"	N
s22 ultra ETA in India?	Hello anyone from India who ordered the phone in the last 7 days? For me it says the order will be delivered on April 2nd but I've been seeing a lot of posts where even for the people that ordered during February are getting their order delayed?????	N
s22+ battery not holding up	"hey all. i got my s22+ when it came out. loving it a lot so far, but I've noticed the battery depletes extremely fast, to the point where I'm only getting 3 to 4 hrs SoT before I have to plug it in again. I'm having to charge 2 to 3 times a day, which feels like a lot. 
I'm using the updated Samsung 45w charger and have battery protect on to 85%. any advice on how to get better battery life? I've looked on here but not really seen anything."	N
Does Anyone Else have a Galaxy S22 Ultra Order that is Stuck with No ETA?	"I had to pre-order mine through Best Buy since Samsung's website was giving me problems with my financing info. I pre-ordered on Feb 15th, so pretty early (I think?).
https://imgur.com/a/cBE067C
After placing the order, it just says ""Thanks! We'll let you know once it's ready.""
Its been stuck on that screen since then. Best Buy support has not been able to give me any other insight other than one person who said that supposedly best buy hadn't received the shipment of phones yet to distribute to stores.
Anyways, back to my original question: Is anybody else having issues getting their phone that pre-ordered fairly in advance? Thanks in advance for your insight."	N
Has anyone that ordered the exclusive S22U colors from Samsung actually gotten their phone or a delivery update ( ie not delayed ) yet?	"I ordered on the day pre-orders went live. Yesterday I got an email saying my S22 Ultra (red) was delayed with no date.
I've read threads/posts here with a lot of people getting the same email so I'm curious if anyone has even gotten theirs shipped yet and I'm just one of the unlucky ones that got theirs pushed back?
I'm tempted to just cancel my order and stick with my S20U. Only reason I ordered was because of the 250 bonus and trade-in was tempting. Now after this delay I've asked myself if I actually need/want it since my S20U is still doing great."	N
Swapped my S22 for an S22 Ultra and the difference in battery life is unbelievable.	"EDIT: Typo in the title, i got the Plus.
To preface, I work at a phone store. I've been using the S22 since about a week before launch, coming from an iPhone 12 Pro Max. I LOVED the format factor of the base S22 but battery life was absolutely abysmal for me. We can get pretty slow so a decent amount of time can be spent on YouTube, playing games,  etc. and I noticed the difference right away. I would start at 9AM and watch sporadically, and by noon I would be at 15%. Mind you, this is with battery saver turned on, screen set to 60hz, brightness almost all the way down. My buddy's 6s Plus gets better battery life than that on the stock battery. I tried to hold on for a while, hoping the reports were true and it would get better. It did not. So, not wanting to go back to iPhone, I swapped up to the S22+ in 256gb. Genuinely the best decision I could've made. While I'm not a huge fan of moving back to the bigger size, the difference in battery life was immediately noticeable. I've actually been able to get an entire day out of my phone."	N
Went from a Pixel 6 to a S22	"I was unhappy with my Pixel 6. It was unweidly to use one handed, heavy (magnetic mounts inside the case wouldn't work well), and was extremely buggy until I updated to the 12L Beta.
The S22 is everything the Pixel should've been, minus touch wiz. I had to use a Nova Launcher, Google Keyboard, and some fiddling with settings to get a similar feel software wise to my Pixel that I loved. I also had to up the minimum dpi in Developer settings because websites looked too zoomed in.
This phone hardware wise feels perfect.
My only caveat, battery size, andcharging speed. It's pretty slow. I was aware of the 25w brick, but I feel like my Pixel 6 charged faster, and that was also a 25w charging phone.
This also can barely make it through the day. This is WITH optimizing for battery life. I even set the screen to 60hz.
Getting about 1600ma charging speed at 50% isn't great.
Other than that I'm slowly making this feel like a Pixel. Just wanted to share my mostly positive experience"	N

Samsung Galaxy S22 : is the shutter problem really a problem ?	"Hello to all.
&amp;#x200B;
I'm in the process of looking to buy a new smartphone, and so far I'm really enjoying the S22 because it's able to take portraits with its telephoto lens, which the Pixel 6 Pro can't do.
&amp;#x200B;
However, I have a question, is the lag for taking pictures, which results in often blurry photos or missed important moments, still present? Is it annoying in everyday life?  
Thank you."	N
Battery getting worse S22 Ultra	"Sitting here at 15% battery life and it's only 9:30 am eastern timezone. I was up at 6 am and it's already dead. Sad to say my old Note9 holds a better charge than this phone and that was the whole reason I replaced that phone. I don't play games just read reddit or news and watch my stocks. 
Well time to go plug my phone in. Will probably be 2 times today seeing how fast it's going"	N
Pixel 6 Pro User Switches to the S22 Ultra, My Thoughts	"I've been a life long iPhone &amp; Pixel user, I was always turned off from Samsung products because of their not so loved TouchWiz days. Gone are those days, thankfully. 
After having the Pixel 6 Pro since release day, I've had nothing but a terrible experience with the phone. Photos were great (sometimes) &amp; everything else was a mess. Performance was slowing down already, constantly cellular issues &amp; battery drains, there is so much to list I honestly can't be bothered to list it all. 
S22 Ultra is released &amp; I'm intrigued, I get it yesterday &amp; I cannot believe how much I love this phone. 
It's everything I wanted the Pixel 6 Pro to be &amp; more. Using this phone is an absolute treat. The software is lovely, the hardware is fantastic, I have absolutely no slow downs or hiccups throughout my usage (granted it's only been 24 hours, but with my Pixel 6 Pro I already had many problems within the 24 hours.)
If anyone is a current Pixel user looking to no longer be a beta tester for Google, I can honestly say I'll never go back to a Pixel device ever again. Samsung is now my favorite smartphone manufacturer."	N
S22 Ultra Exclusive Color US Shipping delayed	"This morning finally got a confirmation from Samsung that my 256GB Graphite S22 Ultra is delayed. Message:
There is an unexpected delay in shipping your order #USxyz (redacted). We will send a new delivery date confirmation as soon as we are ready to ship the delayed item.
We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.
Also ordered on 9th Feb morning with original delivery date being 8th March on old invoice. No expected delivery date on new invoice.
UPDATE: On questioning Customer Service how unfair it is for folks to preorder the device on the first day and still face this issue they said we will offer you 5% upto 50$ refund when you are charged for the order (probably when it's shipped). I have a reference number and need to check with them at that moment for the refund. So more effort on my end I guess."	N
S22 Ultra bad battery life	I've seen comments telling me to wait 7 days for it to optimise but it's been 7 days now and I only get 5 hr 30 min OsT.. seems poor and even comparable to the 4 year old iPhone XS I just upgraded from..	N

Problem with S22 Ultra adaptive refresh rate while gaming	"Just got my S22 Ultra and I notice when I play music game (cytus 2) which requires stable refresh rate, the game stutters a lot and make the game unplayable.
After a lot of fiddling in the settings, removing game launcher, installing and removing game booster plus (using Max FPS settings), trying to uninstall game booster but failed miserably, google how to disable GOS but give up because its too complicated, I notice something... The game only lags more often at slower songs which requires less touch input while playing... Then I was wondering if it is the adaptive refresh rate doing its thing (reducing frame rate when there is no touch input from user).
So I change the settings back to standard refresh rate (constant 60fps) and voila, the stutters is gone completely! This kinda annoys me why samsung doesn't auto disable the adaptive refresh rate while gaming when a stable and smooth FPS is so important for games? Anyway I found a hack using Bixby routine to set resfresh rate to 60fps when a game is running so I won't have to switch it manually everytime before I start a game.
Does anyone here encounters the same issue?"	N
Galaxy S8 -&gt; S22 Ultra! About time!	"Got my S8 in 2018 when the S9 came out and the price dropped. Easily the best phone I've ever owned, and to this day there is nothing really wrong with it - no screen burn, no serious slowdown. OK, battery has taken a beating but that's hardly unexpected at 5 years old.
But sod it, time to upgrade right? Thought I might do the same again and get last year's model but... nah. Straight to the top!
I hope it's good...! :D"	N

S22 Ultra (Exynos) Stuttering mess in 120hz	"Have the s22 ultra for a week now. Got the 800mb day one patch too.
Still the device is a stuttering mess. One of the worst performing phones and definitely not flagship worthy.
Since it is super annoying i decided to switch to 60hz. 
All the stuttering is now gone and 60hz feels more fluid.
Uhm what?
I mean cool i guess but what fricking beta software is this?
Also got the tab s8 ultra. Runs perfectly fine in 120hz.
Otherwise i like the s22 Ultra. I hope samsung can fix its OWN processor with software updates. Its a shame."	N

S22+ battery life is MUCH better than s22	I loved how small the s22 is, but the battery life of the s22+ is so much better than the s22. It's what made me decide to keep the s22+ even though I prefer a smaller phone that doesn't take up as much pocket space. The s22+ seems to have a brighter screen than the s22 as well. Both are excellent phones aside from battery life differences.	N

Trading in phone with a different color from factory	"Has anyone ever traded in a phone that came for a different color from factory.  Reason I'm asking, I got the special color S21 Ultra Phantom Titanium and when I popped my cover off, apparently the back glass cracked.

I said any color is fine since I'm going to trade it in but the rep said Samsung rejected the repair from using any color other than what it came with.

Which way did you purchase S22?	"Hello guys, a human being who's not so well informed when it comes to electronic things here! Could you share some tips on several things as I'm planning to get my mum a new phone?
The main thing is, I am wondering, what's the most used/legitimate way to purchase phones these days? I used to get it off retailer shops a lot and started finding all these specific ""phone plans"" in order to get supposedly good deals on devices not so appealing. 
So I am thinking of buying one online this time, you know, just the device. Would it be the best way if I go on Samsung website? 
And would transferring data from the old device be doable on our own without the help from shop assistants? And when the phone arrives, all I have to do is putting the USIM in the new phone for it to start working? 
And how's your experience with S22 so far? Which model did you choose amongst S22, S22+, S22 Ultra and why?
Also how do you get the screen protector on? I'm used to having it done with the machine at the shop and am wondering if I can do as good a job myself so I am thinking of buying a phone online and going to the Samsung support centre for the screen protector. Or is it too much of a hassle you think? Should I just buy it offline and get it all done there? Hmm..
I'd really appreciate your opinions :)
Thank you!"	N

(US) S22U Excl. Color Delays | Chatted today, was told we'd get automated emails within 3 business days with new delivery dates	"Title. I ordered the Red S22U 512gb. Got the same email as everyone else on Saturday about delays; had the ship date disappear on both site and app. Chatted on Saturday and got the same response as everyone else about ""case has been escalated expect a response in 1-2 days.""  
Chatted again today just to check, let them know about everything done so far + stuff going on on this sub; they said they've been getting a lot of these questions (obviously). Guy said he saw my request was escalated to fulfillment from Saturday, but that everyone should be getting new delivery dates within 3 business days this week regardless.  
Thanked him for the real response and for putting up with the amount of requests we are sending in, he seemed appreciative of that."	N
Why do I have to Frankenstein my phone to get a decent looking case with a magnetically attractive ring and a decent kickstand in 2022??	"https://imgur.com/a/oSgX6ou
So there's my phone case in all its stickerfied glory. I hate it! 
I can't believe there isn't one manufacture making a nice looking case in different colors, not just blister pack clear, that's ESR compatible with a kickstand that can support portrait and landscape mode while not sticking out like a huge mountain.
This is 2022. People have been using magnetic mounts for 20 years now, and kick stands are practically an essential. Back when I had my Galaxy S3, it was so simple. Tape a metal plate to the backside of the cover, and you could stick that phone on any type of magnetic mount. Of course, that was long before wireless charging came along f'd everything up.
BTW if you're interested, here's the products shown...
Spigen Thin Fit Case. I originally bought the Spigen Tough Armor case, but that made the S22U waaay too thick and uncomfortable to hold.
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09JFTV8LP
ESR Boost Phone Kickstand
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08FB5GWZZ
ESR HaloLock Universal MagSafe Ring 360. It's $13 bucks for two rings, but provides an extremely strong grip to a magnet and doesn't interfere with wireless charging. You can use the cheaper metal rings, but you'll have to notch out a part of the ring to get your phone to wirelessly charge on a base charger.

22u exclusive color delay in US - I called and CS is literally useless	"I called to see why my exclusive color was delayed since I pre-ordered immediately and got a confirmation email at 10:45am ET on Feb 9 (show was still going on).

Upgrade to S22 Ultra.	"Hi All. 
I picked up a refurbished S20 Ultra a few months ago. It was directly from Samsung's eBay site for about $535. I really like a large screen and camera performance is important. Except for email and social media I really don't do anything else. Samsung is offering $825 for a trade-in. The total after trade-in is $437.00. I really don't understand why they charge tax on the phone's original retail amount but that's a different story. 
Any input?

Frustration activating an eSIM on unlocked S22 Ultra	"The title. I've tried chat 3 times and even went into a store. The store didn't even know where to start, and the chat reps have told me that the IMEI 2 (the eSIM one) is what they have on file, but the app does not reflect this, and of course activating with the QR code doesn't work. 
Is there a trick to this or am I going to have to leave Verizon again to use a basic function of my phone?"	N
I pre-ordered a Samsung Galaxy S22 and it's being shipped AFTER my 30 day trade in date expires	"Decided to use Verizon's ""Contact Us"" feature on my account, because I placed an order on February 22nd for the new Samsung Galaxy S22. I'm not getting a good deal on the trade in because I'm going from a Galaxy S10 (which is having a hard time charging now) to this phone.
When I looked at my account, it says the Galaxy S22 was ""shipped"" on the summary on February 22nd and my trade in was due 30 days from February 23rd. However, looking at the details, I don't have anything actually shipped nor have I received my package to send out my old phone.
I used the online feature and felt like it was all bots or just generic responses. When I ordered the phone it did say ""Shipped by April 1st, 2022 2nd Day Air Free"" so I asked if they think they know when the shipping date will actually be, since I know these pre-orders were being shipped out on February 25th. Sure enough I get an answer of ""Your phone will be shipped on April 1st, 2022"". I asked if there was a way to expedite the process and get this shipped out sooner and this got ignored.
I had to ask about the trade in then, because there's no way I can ship them a phone before I receive my other one and be without a phone for 2 weeks since I use this for work. I asked if they can change the trade in date and they said ""No, we can't do that but you can re-submit the trade in closer to the due date"".... then gave me no options on how to do this. 
Anyway, figured I'd ask, is there a way to get Verizon to move on this? Why such a long delay? Other places are getting these phones out to people within 1-2 weeks. Thanks in advance!"	N

Do you guys keep location on? Should I take it off when not necessary? What can I do to extend battery life? I run tasker and IFTTT which run in background but they have almost no profiles (the profiles that do work are things like what happenes when you open app or set an alarm, so I think it doesn't take THAT much energy)"	N

S10+ to the S22+	"My thoughts about moving to the new model.
&amp;#x200B;
Pros
&amp;#x200B;
1. Feels very snappy with the 120hz refresh.
&amp;#x200B;
2)  This is the best phone I've ever held in terms of feel. Feels like the perfect weight, I also love the flat display. Made installing the whitestone much easier and it's safer. I feel like curves are the Achilles heel on displays.
I also hated when I would accidentally think my phone was having issues because my palm was touching the edges.
&amp;#x200B;
3) The Camera is noticeably better. Especially on Snapchat and Instagram.
&amp;#x200B;
4) I love the new UI.
&amp;#x200B;
Cons
&amp;#x200B;
1. The battery is okay. Sometimes below average.
&amp;#x200B;
I don't really have any major issues with my device. Samsung throwing great promotions also helped. I purchased it with the tab s8+ 256GB for about $1550 after the trade-in. (with free keyboard)  And that tablet is amazing and has been a life-changer for me."	N
Wallpapers for the 19.5:9 aspect ratio on the S22U	"Does anyone know of any good websites or apps where I can find wallpapers for the specific aspect ratio of the S22U? Or even 19.3:9 which is on the S22/S22+?

Brand New s22 Ultra coming in 2 days and I have to return it	"will try and make this as short as possible but it's alot. So last week I wanted to purchase the ultra on a prepaid card and trade in my s20 fe on the Samsung app. So the app said it doesn't take prepaid cards for whatever reason so I added the card to my PayPal and made the purchase using that for $796. Everything was cool until the following day I get a notification saying my actual bank account was overdrawn for $844
Apparently the system either glitched or something happened to cause a price miscommunication. I have and showed screenshots to Samsung about this. What happened was since only $796 was on the card and they took $844 the card wasn't used at all they took $844 from my bank card which is where the overdraft comes in so I call my bank and tell them what happened so they blocked the transaction and eventually restored my account to what it was and I called Samsung and told them what happened and they told me the krder could not be canceled and it'll eventually ship regardless.
So I spoke to someone else and they told me to not worry once the phone ships they will just have me pay the $796 meaning they were gonna honor the price I showed proof of it being. So 3 days later.... today the phone ships so I contact the same representative and said how will they be taking the $796 we agreed on and she says they can't take the money off the prepaid card with me giving them the info off it and they can't recharge my PayPal even though she said they would do so. 
So now they're telling me they can't honor the price if I reorder and I may not get the full $475 for the s20 fe since that promotional deal I believe is over for trade ins. So here I am with a brand new phone coming in 2 days that hasn't been paid for because they didn't/ can't modify the payment to take the money off my pre card and they claim they see its already paid for through PayPal which is why the phone was shipped in the first place but my bank canceled and restored my account for me already. 
I'm frustrated by all of this and will be even more mad once fed ex gets here and I have to tell them no. I would love to keep the phone but I'm sure there's a high chance the phone becomes blacklisted.

Question: what is the point of "single view" in Director's view?	"Like seriously, the reason why I thought that the Director's View option in the camera app exists
Is because it's to simulate recording in both front and back cameras,
So in the form of ""picture-in-picture"" and ""split view"", it makes sense.
But in single view, as the name implies, you can only record either only the front or the back cameras. Like what?!
Also, I do understand that probably one of the reasons for ""single view"" mode is so that we can preview &amp; switch into any of the 3(ultrawide, wide, and 3x)cameras located at the right side of the screen, whether you're recording thru the rear or front camera. 
But since it's locked at 1920x1080 recording quality, 
If that's the case, isn't it just better to skip ""single view - Director's view"" option
and just head straight into ""video"" mode where we can even choose our aspect ratio &amp; Resolution/FPS???
If anyone can let me know what I'm missing in this, that would be great. Thanks"	N

Pro photographer with the S22 ultra followup	"Hey everyone so here's a follow up on my previous post about me as a professionnal photographer using the S22 ultra as a camera.   
This time I shot something different and I relied on the camera's automatic mode and only used the built in edit function of the gallery app. Here are some shots I took with it. 
&amp;#x200B;
So here's what I think about it : 
The phone's ""AI"" or algorithm tricks the eye in some way and it does it very well, the photos aren't of great quality (I mean nothing compared to what a professionnal does with a decent sized sensor) but it tricks us into mimicking a professionnal result and it does it well as long as you don't zoom into the photos too much. As soon as you try to edit them a bit too much, the pictures fall apart pretty quickly. 
But I must say that for the first time, I'll be ok being lazy and not pick up my pro camera because out of the box, the camera takes better looking pictures than my unedited pictures from my camera and I really enjoy the fact the camera will always expose to prevent blowing up the highlights. The problem here is if you have a backlit subject the camera will do a terrible job of getting a proper exposure on the subject and if you override it manually, the result is pretty bad. But overall, I'm impressed with what I can achieve as long as I keep those photos for social media, as soon as you watch them on a decent screen / print, you'll know...

Has anyone else had this happen?  What was the fix?  With it stopping like that on less that a full charge the first (two) times, make a bad start for the battery in general?  Thanks in advance all!  
&amp;#x200B;
Otherwise This phone is great.  I tried the iPhone 13 Pro Max before this.  I have always been a Samsung guy, but the wife and son convinced me to try it.  I returned it before the 14 day grace period to get this one lol."	N
Exclusive Color processing steps on website	For exclusive colors in the USA (I've seen several posts from UK, Canada, and other countries), does anyone know the order in which the processing shows on the website? Meaning, it goes from Order Placed to Customizing xxx, etc. What are the steps in between Customizing and Shipped, if any? I unfortunately tried to cancel this order a few days after placing it on 2/18 (Red 256GB), but I got the dreaded "Unable to Cancel" email and my cancel button is gone, so I can't exactly track it that way.

Which would make a better combination buy?	"Hi all.. before I start just want to let you all know that I am using a trusty note 8 and gear s3 frontier as my daily driver. I preordered a s22 ultra and I have some options of discounted wearable choices. To cut the story short, the options are
A. Buds 2 + watch 4 classic + buds pro
B. Buds 2 + watch 4 classic + watch 4
If i chose option A i might give the buds 2 to my wife while option B might keep both watches to myself and change it according to the theme of the day.
Any opinion?"	N
S22 Ultra cases with cut outs for each individual lens?	I'm looking for a back-cover-style case with round cut outs for each individual lens and for the sensor/flash. A good example would be the official Samsung leather and silicone cases. Unfortunately, I am quite picky, silicone is too grippy for my taste (too much friction with pants) and the leather cases are plain boring. Apart from those I cant really find other cases with the individual cut outs. Does anyone know any other cases that fit my high demands?	N

S22+ vs S22 Ultra or S21 Ultra?	"I'm currently using my S10+ so it's about time for an upgrade. Over the last few days I've been reading &amp; watching reviews of the S22 lineup and still I'm finding it hard to make a decision on whether to get a S22 or look at second hand market for an S21 Ultra.
One of the main reasons why I'm struggling is because lots of reviews have mentioned how bad the battery life is and that it drains too fast all the way down to 20% within a few hours or so compared to the S21 Ultra. Now I'm not sure if this applies to both the Snapdragon &amp; Exynos chipsets, but where I live Exynos is the only option I have.
Been looking around on Facebook Marketplace/Shpock for S21 Ultra's and they're going for appox. £600 to £750-(New), whilst if I trade in my S10+ an S22 Ultra will be (256GB) £979 or (512GB) £1059. S22+ will be (256GB) £779."	N

While chatting with them I (politely) asked if there was any sort of compensation for the delay. They said to message back once I receive it to get $100 promo code. YMMV  
(This is on top of messaging them about getting the 7.5% off deal they offered in the last two days of pre-order, which they said they will refund me once the phone ships. Even though it's delayed I'm quite happy lol)

I have the s22u, 12gb exynos model and I have some issues that I'd like to check it anyone else is having. 
1) games on facebook/facebook games straight up refuses to play ANY game. Updated app, reinstalled app, updated phone and still nothing. 
2) while in a call, audio cuts out and I end the call but my phone is stuck in a weird offline state. Can't make any calls, can't recieve any calls, can't toggle data on or off as it gets stuck on h+.

Questions about Data Transfer ( Smart Switch )	"Okay so I just got my S22 Ultra and have been using Note 9 so far. And had a few basic questions that I can't seem to get the answers to. 
1) When it transfers apps does it also transfer all their app data. For example, my Netflix, banking apps and such would be logged into. My chat apps would have all conversations, files, pictures and such moved over as well. 
Or does it simply install the same apps on the new phone. And I need to manually log in and transfer/restore data within them. 
2) Does the data on the previous device get deleted. Sounds stupid, I know. But the last time I used smart switch was between a Note 4 and S8+, my contacts and messages (texts) disappeared on the Note 4. So am not sure if that was just some bad luck file corruption or that's the way things work out. 
3) Does wired vs wireless make any difference other than speed ? And which is better. 
4) Does smart switch only work or have any difference if I run it while initial phone set-up vs any time after. 
5) Any other advices you may have on this process. Things I should transfer or I shouldn't ? And so on. 
Thanks a bunch for reading and would appreciate any answers or suggestions."	N

One plus 9 Pro Or S22 (regular one, not plus or Ultra)	"Hi guys, I need your opinion on these two phones. I recent switched to Pixel 6 but really did not like the experience. The phone looked great and function okay, but battery life is terrible, and charging left a lot to be desired. I am looking at these two option to replace pixel since they are high end phone that does not require down payment for JOD.
S22- I like my S21, S22 got the same design language, but I am kind of worried about the battery life with new power hungry chip and small battery. Also not a fan of their finger print tech. Does how does the battery compare, it is not ultra.
One plus- Enjoyed 8t, fast charging was a life changer, nice overall set, but one plus always seems have some buggy software issue.  ( I know one plus 10 pro is already out, but I do not think the upgrade is worth the wait)

S21fe or S22 or A52s	"I kinda need a new phone, I am from Europe meaning any phone im buying is Exynos. I was thinking between S21Fe(6bg/128gb) or S22. With S22 you get new buds pro and price of S22 is 840$. Meanwhile S21Fe I can buy for 650$. S21Fe has bigger battery of 4500mAh and S22 3700mAh. I read few posts on reddit and a lot of people returned their S22  because of battery issues and battery only lasting for 5 hours. I have also read that some users had problems with S21Fe battery. Was also kinda looking at A52s (6gb version, 4500mAh, 390$) but it has bad built quality and im looking for phone that would stay for at least 3 years. S22+ fits my needs but its kinda way too expensive its around 1130$. Im  little on the side of the heavier phone users, I dont play games but i do watch some videos and use social media applications. I am currently using my 5 years old S8 and im looking for upgrade. I really like the performance of S series. I got information from a friend that he needs to charge 3 times a day his S21 old 2 months (from 40ish to 85% battery).
If anyone has experience or suggestions on some of these phones it would be awesome, thanks.
TLDR: S21FE and S22 battery problems, A52s bad built quality ,S22+ too expensive"	N

Question about fast charging	"Hi all, I've been playing with my S22 Ultra today which I absolutely love love love! 
I'm really confused though about one aspect. I used the cable that came in the box with a Samsung 25W fast charger I bought. In settings under ""battery"", both fast charging and super fast charging are toggled on. I just assumed that super fast charging was for when you plugged in a 45W charger and that fast charging was for the 25W charger.  
So I plug in the 25W charger and the lockscreen says ""super fast charging"". And sure enough, it charged my S22 Ultra from 76% to 81% in literally a few mins. Like the time I plugged in the charger, got up to the kitchen and grabbed a snack, took a quick bathroom visit and returned.  
I was astonished and blown away but I'm really confused how the 25W charger can register as super fast charging. And even more so how it can charge so incredibly quick."	N

Screen rotation only in selected apps	Ever since Android 12 I haven't been able to figure out how to get back the option to allow auto rotation only in apps that I specifically select. Oddly I tried googling it and I can't find any information about how this setting works. I know I had the option before because the screen would only rotate when I was in YouTube or adobe Acrobat. For other apps I would need to manually turn on auto rotation so screen rotates when I'm in landscape. If anyone knows how to bring it back please let me know. Thank you in advance.	N
Charger question...	"Hey! I'm new to Samsung and am a little confused about the wattage. For my previous Pixel, I went out and bought a bunch of 18w PD chargers.

45W Charging Curve Tested on Official Samsung EP-T4510XBEGUS - 40W delivered @ peak, more wattage delivered vs. 3rd party charger for 23 minutes - overall charging time the same	"Hello,
This is a follow up to my previous post [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS22/comments/szsmos/s22u_super_fast_charging_20_test_powered_off_w3rd/) where I documented the charging curve of a 3rd party 65w charger supporting PPS and showing ""Super Fast Charging 2.0"" on screen when powered on, using a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 512GB Green AT&amp;T (Flashed to U\`1 Firmware with Modified Odin)
I performed this test in the same conditions (Power off, 0% charge, Room Temp), but with the (new) Samsung Official 45W Charger, EP-T4510XBEGUS and included cable.
I used the same tester, TC66C. I'll focus on the differences in charging behavior to the previous test.
Peak charge wattage occured @ 266 seconds - delivering 40.1W - compare to 28W delivered from the 3rd party adapter.
There were about 23 minutes spent with a charge current over 28W.
Interestingly the time to complete charge was the same within margin - 54 minutes in this test vs. 52 minutes in the previous test. Showing the official 45W charger provides better bursty charging, but not necessarily better overall charging time.
Heat generation felt substantially higher in the beginning, matching the higher wattage output.
I'll get a charging curve from the Official 25W to compare next.

[PSA] Fix for Gmail Not recieving any notifations	" 
This is the only thing that worked for me regarding not getting gmail notifications for a new email on my android . After doing all the other obvious stuff to make sure you are going to get notifications, you have to change the setting for syncing the labels. For some unknown reason, the default doesn’t set them all be synched.
For my google pixel 3–
1. Go to Settings
2. Go to the Gmail address in question
3. Go to Manage Labels
4. Change any that are not synched to sync ‘Last 30 days.’

S22 Ultra for SPen?	"I currently have an S21 5G, which I absolutely love, but I'm considering upgrading to the S22 Ultra for the S-pen features.

I've been using the official Samsung 25W USB-C ""super fast"" charger to charge both phones and on the S22 base, the estimate to full charge has been pretty spot on to actual.  Same goes for the third party Ravpower 20W USB-C PD3.0 when I used it with the S22 base, charge eta to completion was spot on.
Things are quite different with the S22+ using the same Samsung charger.  Earlier today when I plugged it in eta was showing 46min to completion but the phone actually completed the charge in about half the time, which is great.

Galaxy S21+ or just regular S22	I plan on upgrading me and my wife from our A71. My main options is either a S21+ or just a regular S22. I can't really afford to go to a S22+ or ultra. Would I be better off getting the S21+ or the S22? I heard that the S22 isn't much of an upgrade from the S21. I am looking for something to game on and my wife for pictures and videos.	N
Is the S22+ Canada a myth?	"I am getting extremely frustrated with this. My order page has said shipping/arrival on Feb22 and has not changed once. I've gotten 1 email telling me what to do with my new phone. AND I've gotten a different story from every rep I've talked to. With stories ranging from they've confirmed its the warehouse and was going to ship out any moment to being told my case is being escalated and I would be emailed shortly, and then, surprise, not receiving something from Samsung. They've given me no time frames, no updates with anything remotely concrete, no explanation why the order page hasn't been updated at all. 
I've also gotten very sick of the ""thank you for your interest in the new thing"" and the support reps the moment they feel they've appeased me start trying to sell me something else. Its almost as if I got this phone because my last one is dying.
I'm sorry, but Samsung is of a scale that they have to know lead times of things happening in the next month, the supply chain is not that erratic at that point. Something has to have gone really wrong logistically for them not to remotely know when things are happening.
Quite honestly its the support and lack of updates that are really getting to me. Yes, I want my phone that I've paid money for. I have zero interest in extending Samsung a loan. But really, its the sheer lack of communication, the disingenuous support, who either make things up or don't have access to anything more than I do. I don't know which is worse. 
I'm just looking for anything, hell an update to the order page removing the shipping date of the 22nd would at least show that they are acknowledging that I don't have it."	N

S20 FE 5G vs S22 or S22+. Would it be worth it to upgrade?	I believe Verizon has some sort of trade deal going on where they'll give you $800 for an eligible trade in towards an S22 (I'm not 100% if the + is included). There could and probably is caveats but I was wondering if it'd be worth the upgrade from my S20 FE 5G. I looked on a comparison site and it looked like the FE had a better battery and maybe some better display things. The only thing I could really see standing out in the 22 is the better rear camera and increased RAM. I don't know too much about Samsung's tech so would it even be worth te upgrade if it was free or $100 give or take?	N

Differences between Android 9 and 12	"I just pre-ordered a Galaxy 22 Ultra to replace my Note 8. Some oddities I notice in Android 9 on the Note: 
- If I am reading a new text message via Android Auto, and a new message comes in, I'm not notified that a new message has arrived.  
- If I tell my phone to ""Read New Messages,"" it reads all previously read messages in ADDITION to the new messages. 
I use Android Auto a LOT. So my nits are mostly with AA. 
There were a couple other nits that I had, but for the life of me, I can't remember them now. I'm supposed to get my new phone on Saturday. 
Does anyone know if either of these behaviors still occur with Android 12 on the S22 Ultra?

The idea seems brilliant to me but I know it's not so popular, so maybe there are any setbacks/disadvantages to that approach?

Should I instead use charging pad? Maybe you guys know of some negative aspects that I don't see? I don't want to buy two devices, because one of them will be mostly unused, making it an ""electric waste"".

S22 Battery Protection / Life?	"I upgraded from S8+ straight to the S22, ironically enough I was wanting a small phone (almost went with iPhone mini!) but the smaller S22 sealed the deal and I waited out my very used S8+ until this one came out.
Right away out of the box I turned on the battery protection mode which prevents the phone from charging past 85%.... HOWEVER.... I am ending up with a dead battery before bedtime if I spent much time on my phone during the day.
I am in the US so I believe we only get the phones with Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, which appears to possibly be....how to say it... a battery hog?
Would I be better off letting the phone charge to 100% a few weeks then enabling 85% charge cap? Or should I keep the cap on for now until I simply can't make it a full day? I'm basically afraid of making the future battery life even worse since I don't upgrade phones for 3-4 years if I can help it."	N

Return/exchanging a S22+	So I recently upgraded my phone from an s9+ to S22+ earlier this month. I have been using Samsung for a while so I did not spend a whole of time researching it. I should have since I work in infosec but I am not an Apple fanboy. 1. I find out that there are issues with Samssung encryption. 2. Samsung is throttling performance. Both of which I am not thrilled with but then Samsung then gets breached and their sourcecode leaked. That breaks the camel's back. So here's my question.

Absolute Garbage Experience Ordering Samsung S22 Phone Through Verizon. UPS Lost Phone	"I ordered a Samsung S22 Ultra through Verizon on 2/22 and the entire ordering process with Verizon have been the worst I have experienced and absolute garbage. The tracking shows that it was shipped March 1st via UPS 2 Day but it never arrived. It kept showing as rescheduled so it is fair to assume that it was lost or stolen. 
&amp;#x200B;
I have made countless calls to get this item reordered only to be on the phone an hour each time without getting anything resolved. Finally today, the latest representative figured out how to make a new order but I will have to pay $117.25  up front despite having already paid that for the lost phone that never arrived. They cannot refund the original amount until they ""get the original phone back"" or ""figure it out with UPS"". 
&amp;#x200B;
So as of today 3/10, I am getting billed $153 which includes the 5G service and the $36 phone payment for a phone that I don't have and a 5G service that I cannot use. Are there any managers on here that can assist me with this? At this point, I am over everything and the only thing holding me back from switching to T-Mobile is that I have a back up phone."	N
S22 Ultra Software Update	I got this phone around February 25th, and it's now March 10th and have yet to receive the March security patch update. Anyone in the same boat? The reason I ask is I have seen multiple people with a AT&amp;T S22 already receive it.	N
How long will the S22 Ultra trade in offer last?	My phone is set to arrive in April, and I used the Samsung trade in. Was hoping to double dip with AT&amp;T. Would it last till then?	N
S22 Ultra Software Version	I have the s22 ultra thru T-Mobile it is on the January 1st security patch. When I check for update it says software up to date. Just wondering if others with the s22 ultra thru T-Mobile are on the same security patch as me or a different one.	N
Pixel 6 user looking to jump to S22 ... what should I know? Any advice about switching?	"Hey all, i'm a Pixel 6 user since launch, looking to switch to the S22. I'm fed up with the Pixel 6 for 3 main reasons.
1) The phone is just too damn heavy for me to comfortably use.
2) The phone is just way too damn big for my hands.
3) The fingerprint reader on this phone is god awful.
-----------------------
**What are some problems or things that a Pixel user like myself should know before I make the jump to the S22? Any deals I should wait for?** Just looking for advice about the switch! Thanks in advance for any feedback!"	N
S22 Ultra: freezing, crashing, and unexpected reboot	"Hi,  
I am making this post to figure out if I'm the only one experiencing these issues, and not to get any sort of solution - As I don't think there is any beside returning the phone / service. 
I pre-ordered the Samsung S22 Ultra (Exynos version, EU) in that sweet green colour just shy of a month ago - And 5 days ago it arrived. The initial impression is that it's a great phone - Beautiful screen, great camera, and the s-pen has a lot of uses. Although the phone doesn't feel quite as snappy as my soon to be three year old OnePlus 7t Pro. All in all a great experience.
I set up the phone (no transferring old data, as I like starting clean), and made a test call (first thing I usually do to make sure I'm reachable) - Good, we are online and ready for action. Then I installed my most used apps, and started tweaking the phone to my liking.
The problem started when I made mye first proper call. It was fine for about a minute and a half, then suddenly the call was dropped, and when I tried to turn the screen on, nothing. The phone then showed me the Samsung logo, and I realised it had restarted, cutting off my call. I tried again, and the call was cut off, and the phone crashed after a minuted and a half of call time. I made quite a few tests the following day, but continued to use the phone. 
Skip forward to today, and the phone crashes and restarts every time I try to make a call. It randomly freezes for about a minute, and then restarts (this can happen even if I'm not using the phone - it's just lying on my coffee table, and I suddenly see the Samsung logo when it's booting up again). It's entirely unusable - I'm just so bummed as I was looking forward to getting a new phone, and having to return it / service it, is quite a setback :(
**Anyone else experienced this? :)**
*If have tried the following - no luck:*  
*Safe Mode*  
*Different SIM card*  
*Factory reset (done that twice)*  
TL;DR: My S22 Ultra freezes and crashes during phone calls 90% of the time. Making the phone unusable as an actual phone. Anyone else experiencing this? :)"	N

Upgrade to s21+ or s22+?	"Hey all, 
Currently I have OnePlus 3t, and it is very much time to upgrade. I kinda have a budget for either s21+ or s22+, but I´m cheap, and seeing how everyone loves their S21 I am tempted to buy S21, cause it is 40% cheaper now. What are your thoughts on this, am I hurting myself by being cheap? 
I truly care only about lack of lags and camera :) but as you could guess, I am expecting this phone to last like 5 years. Please, advise!"	N
Samsungs version of Google messages on s22 ultra	I have the s22 ultra and am using Google messages that came pre-installed. Is there any way I can use Googles version instead of the skinned samsung version without an update changing it back to samsungs version?	N
S22 Ultra battery vs other SD8G1 WQHD+ 120hz phones	"So there's this battery review by the channel TechNick on YouTube - https://youtu.be/sZQkCIisBF8
In this video, all the phones are fresh out of the box, so none of the phones have learnt usage patterns. And you can see other similarly speced phones exhibit a better battery life performance than the s22 ultra.
The oppo and oneplus phones have the same battery size, same processor and the same display specs, yet they last longer than the s22 ultra despite running hotter. They even perform better than their predecessors, not the case for the ultra.
This made me wonder that there must be scope for better software optimization because otherwise it doesn't make sense. What are your thoughts?"	N
S22U Delayed Again	Ordered a S22U at the beginning of the announcement on 2/9 with an original delivery date of 3/8, now my delivery date has been pushed up to Apr 12, 2022. Anyone else notice their delivery date pushed up to a ridiculous date? Samsung won't even let me cancel the order because it's in "fulfillment".	N
How much worse is the S22's battery life compared to the S21?	Has anyone seen any graphs or data that shows exactly how bad the S22's battery life is? I'm going from an S7 to either an S21 or S22 (not plus or ultra) and I'm wondering if the S21's battery life is really that much better to justify giving up the improved camera, since both of those are my main concerns with a new phone. I don't know how to check my SOT on this S7 but I'd estimate an average of 1-2 hours SOT daily, mainly just browsing insta and twitter and watching Twitch streams. I figured if the S22 can still go a whole day without needing to recharge given that average activity then I'd deal with it to get the improved camera, but I'm hearing it can't even last that long.	N
S22 delivery in Belgium	"Are there people how bought a S22 or + or ultra.
I bought a 22 + online color a it was delivered in just 2 weeks the ultra I bought  6 days prior to the + is still
Not delivered. It's also a online color. These will both  replace a S 8 and a A 70 witch is a great phone but the camera sucks. The A70  is almost 2 years. I will keep it as a backup in case one of the kids phones  breaks .
Let me now how your delivery of your purchase  is going."	N
S22U "On the Way" but no shipping details whatsoever, anyone else? Canada	"Ordered Feb 9th, Sky Blue 256GB. 
Does anyone else's S22U say ""on the way"" with absolutely no details? Nothing from FedEx, advanced tracking shows nothing."	N
Do the S22u Online exclusive colours actually exist?	According to my research they do not. (My research isn't research)	N
Who traded in their old S or Note phone for S22 Ultra for a $300 bonus?	Asking because I ordered 2 and will trade in 2 old galaxy phones, an old Note 5 and an S5 Neo. I have a deal of a crack screen S10 for $50. Curious if I can make something more than $300 bonus for the S10?	N
Anyone else having issues with their S22 Ultras?	"For example (I think this has stopped; either that or it's intermittent) I take a photo, go to the home screen, open my camera a few seconds later and it brings me the gallery not the camera then I have to close the gallery by bringing up the app menu then swiping and re open the camera.
Once or twice, when looking at a static screen (maybe the variable refresh rate?) the screen went black for a few seconds then came back on 
Yesterday my phone froze with the screen on and I was not able to switch it off. Eventually I manged to somehow reboot after a long while. 
Still not that great at typing plus v easy to make new paragraphs in the middle of writing  (although that may just be me). Frustrating having it change things on autocorrect 
And finally, it won't let me copy links at all. Well Google let's me copy them. But try paste them in Notes and it just doesn't work. Works pasting it back into Google search bar. 
Also how have I seen these amazing night shots of the moon with the camera? Tried to take one last night with night mode of the moon, came out a blurry  light source. My Nikon takes much better pics of the moon. Could be like when Huawei took pics on a DLSR and passed them off as phone photos. 
And also when you switch do not disturb on when you have a set alarm it doesn't always give the option to set to when your alarm is set. Say you have an alarm at 10:30. I have the option to set to 10 hours or whatever (which is adjustable) so if I go to bed at 1am I have the option to put DND on till 10am or 11 am not 10:30. I want my alarm to go off but don't want to be woken up early. 
None of these things really interfere with using the phone (apart from when it froze) but when you buy a phone outright (works out cheaper than taking out a new contract) and you're paying this kind of money for a phone it's disappointing. 
I tried rebooting and it didn't sort out the pasting."	N
S22 vs S22+, upgrading from S21	"Hey Everyone,
I have an S21 with T-Mobile and am looking at upgrading to the S22 or S22+ and am looking at the differences between and as far as I can tell it's just a bigger screen and bigger battery ( but they're supposed to be more efficient now.)
Tmobile will give me $800 for my s21 which would be an equivalent exchange for the S22 and would cost me $200 for the S22+
I've heard some somewhat disappointing things so far about the base 22 with things like battery life and brightness. Wanted to get some peeps opinions."	N
S22 on Verizon - anyone gone internationally yet?	"Hey Folks,
Went to MX with my S22 and despite 2 hours with customer service, they couldn't figure out why my phone couldn't get service.
Also missing were the options to select network type (GLOBAL, 4G, 3G etc.) which I guess is an indicator for international support.
Wondering if anyone else has also had issues. Realize this could be a small group considering COVID, but never hurts to ask."	N
Is it true that only the S22 series is gonna get the update for the throttling	Is it true the S22 is the only S series phone getting the throttling issue fixed and the S21 S20 and S10 won't or might get it or am I wrong I hope I'm wrong cause that's messed up that only the S22 will get the update to fix the throttling.	N
Kids and pets' photos	"I don't have kids, and my dogs are too old to move fast, but I saw thus on a video about how to make the S22U take better photos of moving objects, so just passing it along,

Messages - Get Rid of "You:" ?	I am referring to the list of message threads on the opening screen. Is there any way to get rid of the prefix "You:" that shows in front of all threads where I was the last one to communicate? I find it totally unnecessary. Plus, it takes away 5 characters from the actual text of the message which I find more helpful than a long list of "You:". Could not find a setting that would turn that "helpful" feature off?	N
How do I apply themes to my messanger?	I have an S22 Ultra and when I apply the Samsung themes that are supposed to change my messenger or text messages along with the rest of the phone, it stays either white or in dark mode. What do I do?	N
Can I enable Work Profile on S22?	"My company uses an app to manage all email, tasks, calendar, stuff like that. One of the requirements of having work email on my phone is that they have forced me to install a VPN and I think it's running all the time. In VPN settings, it is not turned on to run all the time, but the little vpn icon is always on up by the time and battery symbols.  
1. Is there a way to enable a work profile and separate this work app into that profile and run other apps in personal profile? 
2. Is my VPN always on even though that option is not checked?
3. Can my work see everything I do on my phone, including browser activity and app usage? 
Thank you"	N
Samsung Gallary	"Hi! When I open a picture in the gallery to show someone there is a tiny insert on the bottom showing the next 10 pics in the gallery to choose from. 
How can I get rid of that little insert? It ruins the appearance of the picture I am showing someone. 
Thanks"	N
Hoping For Update Soon	"Hope they put out an update soon for our US released S22 Ultra cause so far the only thing better on it compared to our Note 10+ is the camera and the battery lasting long then our 3 year old Note 10+.
Tired of the spinning arrow."	N
Watched this video of an cased S22 Ultra fall less than 5 inches and cracked the screen.	I left this comment "From top to bottom of a lot of the phone cases there are raised ridges on a lot of the cases to give "Raisivity", as @Flossy Carter would say. It's to keep the screen of the phone from being flush if placed or falls face down. From side to side, the screen is higher to allow access to the curved edge. I just looked at my $80 UAG Kevlar case, and the exact same thing would have happened to my S22 U if it hit the edge of a table. I swapped it out after seeing your video with a $20 CaseBorne V off of Amazon. Damn you curved edge! Damn you to hell!"	N

Regarding USER FLAIRS, and posts being deleted	"Hello, we first want to apologize to everyone about the issues with the USER Flairs. As stated in the pinned post (https://www.reddit.com/r/S22Ultra/comments/t09wou/user_flairs/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) We looked to bring clarity and distinction between the different models, especially between the 2 chipsets (Exynos and Snapdragon). We hoped this would make it easier to identify problems like the screen issues, discuss them, and share fixes if possible. However, this has caused more issues than what it originally looked to solve. In addition, the required user flair has made the experience in this sub worse for everyone. We sincerely apologize for that. 
From now on, we will no longer require user flairs in order to post or comment (we turned off the setting this morning), but we still encourag the use of them or make sure to identify your device in troubleshooting or problem related posts, this is so the community can respond appropriately. 
Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We encourage feedback and recommendations. As stated, we apologize for making the experience worse for all. This community is yours; you speak, we will listen."	N

How do you use the S-PEN?	"Coming from S9 Plus and S20 Ultra, I haven't had a pen in my phone before.

So, I am curious how you use your own with your phone?
I'd love to get inspired to do more.
HOW do YOU enjoy using the S-PEN?"	N
Update on S22U MagSafe	"Sorry for the delay guys, it's been a crazy few weeks and I've been trying to finish up the remaining Pixel 6 Pro orders before I complete the S22U design. 
I also have been hit with a major delay in my overseas supplier so case design has been slowed considerably. 
All in all, the MagSafe design for the S22U is completed and works as intended. I've done S-Pen tests and I can say, the preliminary results are looking pretty good. The functionality of the S-Pen is almost completely unaffected. I say ""almost"" because there are a few minor caveats. This will be explained more in depth with a full release post later this week for the case. 
Unlike the Pixel 6 Pro, the design for the S22 Ultra will be kept minimalistic, and with minimal customization options. This is due to the massive responses I've received, and my overall inability to keep up with large quantities of orders when high amounts of customization is involved. I fell behind considerably with the Pixel 6 Pro case and had to increase handling times to 7-10 days. I do not wish to do the same for the S22U case, so in keeping customization to a minimum, I can also have a much shorter handling time and get the cases out much quicker. 
For now, I think the design will allow you to choose between the color of the case, and the design on the back (ie. the pattern, like smooth, honeycomb, etc) and whether or not you'd like a kickstand cutout so you can attach your own kickstand. This offers a small degree of customization without requiring too much per case. 
I will be making a much more in depth post later this week which will offer much more details on the case. 
For now, if you have any questions, feel free to ask. I am a little busy but will answer as efficiently as I can. 
Also, if you have any other suggestions, please let me know. I have had a few requests asking for a lanyard hole to allow for lanyard straps to attach to the case. I am considering that and attempting to implement it. 
Thank you for all the support."	N

PSA: Note 20's Spen fits inside the S22 Ultra, but your phone won't pair with it	"* Note 20 Spen fits fine, and white pen color matches the white S22U
* The latency is the same as with S22U's spen, as latency improvements comes from the software side on the phone
* Spen removal/insertion detection works normally
* The tip is a bit harder so it glides smoother if your screen has a protection film
* The pen won't pair with S22U over bluetooth, so air actions (e.g. using the pen button to take pictures) won't work
* Occasionally you'll get notifications that the original Spen is disconnected

Well, for some reason, now it's gone completely. I've searched everywhere in the settings menu, and have searched online and found other people that have similar issues but haven't been able to pinpoint a specific solution. It seems that the common factor though is switching devices.

Just a little warning: don't buy Casebus phone cases. False advertising/description/feature promises.	"I came across Casebus while looking for a wallet case for the S22 Ultra. I bought a case through their company website, and it was a regular case shell with a small magnetic tri-fold wallet that attached to the case. I don't like flip cases, and didn't want anything too bulky. Also, I didn't want all my credit cards and stuff with me 24/7, especially while sitting around the house. I wanted to be able to come home, detach the wallet, and use my phone like a phone, but have everything together when I went out.
The website description showed several images promising that the case supports wireless charging if you detach the wallet part. It also describes it a few times in the text. Once I got the case, it definitely doesn't support wireless charging. The phone thinks something is blocking the phone between it and the charger, and I tried on several different chargers by different brands. One was a Samsung charger too.
The only reason why I'm heavily warning against this brand is because of their customer service and item descriptions. I showed them screenshots of the website and how they promised wireless charging. I also followed their exact procedure mentioned on their site for requesting a refund. I was trying to get my money back because I exclusively use wireless charging and bought this particular case with it in mind, as well as the stuff mentioned above. They influenced my purchasing decision with false descriptions, which is false advertising.
The company told me that it was not cost-effective to have the item returned since they were located in China (and I'm in the US). They told me that I can pay for shipping myslef and return it, but after looking into this, I would actually be spending $15 more than the refund would be. They also told me that they will not refund me unless they get the item back.
However... despite all of this, they DID offer me an equal-cost exchange for a different item of my choice. I do not need another item, nor want one. (Especially with their inaccurate product descriptions). Also, how is it that they won't take a hit and just refund the cost and not require the return, yet they WILL take a hit and ship a different item while not requiring the return of the old one? Makes no sense to me! It just seems like some stupid personal or company policy is taking priority here, and it isn't making logical sense to me.
Anyways... luckily for me, I used Paypal for the purchase, so I opened a case and got a refund the next day from the seller. (Confirmed too). I filed it under an ""inaccurate item description"". The company was not willing to argue with me in front of Paypal, but yet, they are still emailing me currently, trying to refuse a refund, give me my only options they'll accept, and just all-out giving me the runaround. I did just reply to them that I received my refund from the Paypal dispute case and that this is now over.
Please... just be careful with some of these companies. I should've thought about the purchase more beforehand, especially since they had reviews on their own site, which were all positive (implying that they could be filtering out negative ones and only showing the good ones)."	N
Pre-order gift of Super Fast Wireless Charger not such a great gift	"With my Ultra pre-order credit I chose a Super Fast Wireless Charger (single pad) as I was running out of choice. The 45W brick was OOS. Unbeknown to me this wireless charging pad only comes with a worthless cable and no brick. 
Anyone know of a good brick that is compatible with this charger? The bricks I have laying around don't seem to be compatible because all I get is a blinking yellow light on the pad when connected.

Sick of waiting for your phone and want it next week here is how	"I ordered a red s22 ultra on the 9th Feb during the event and was told it was going to wait till the 10th of March, but I didn't get it by then and got told it could take up to the 30th of March for it to come. Personally, for me it is not worth it, so I did some looking around and found how you can get the s22 ultra next week it won't be an exclusive colour but it will come.
The way you do this is on carphone warehouse ( [https://www.carphonewarehouse.com/samsung/galaxy-s22-ultra-5g.html#!colour=white&amp;capacity=512GB&amp;dealType=sf](https://www.carphonewarehouse.com/samsung/galaxy-s22-ultra-5g.html#!colour=white&amp;capacity=512GB&amp;dealType=sf)) 
You can only get the green next week at 512 GB or the white next week at 256 or 512 GB, the others you have to wait till the 6th of April which is still better than what people are getting told or what they are offering on their websites. 
You will still get the free Disney plus and galaxy buds pro I'm getting mine on the 15th of March. And there is still a trade-in offer if you like, not as good as Samsung ones but there is one if you are looking to do that."	N

Mod Announcement: Battery screenshots that do not follow the rules will lead to an instant ban	"Any battery screenshot needs to fit these five guidelines:
1) Your phone model and chipset must be listed (S22/S22+/S22 Ultra; Exynos/Snapdragon)
This goes for any kind of post, really
2) Why this matters (aka not just ""showing off my battery"")
3) How it matters (detailed description of your usage patterns)
4) What you did (what you have tried to solve your battery problem or enquiry so far)
5) Where you want to go (what would count as 'success' for you)
This naturally means that your screenshot would be much better as a *text* post. If you don't do this and we receive a report on your post, you will get an instant ban with no questions asked.
So far, the battery megathread is optional, in that problems that are actually worthy of their own post are still allowed. If this behaviour continues however we will be forced to make the megathread a mandatory location for any battery post regardless of its contents. This also means that by extension if your problem isn't worth a full post, you know what to do: comment on the megathread instead."	N

5G US AT&amp;T with S22+ Asian/PH Version	"Hello Guys, Just want to ask if I purchased a Galaxy S22+ in the Philippines and decided to bring it with me when I go to the US and get there an AT&amp;T sim card, will I be getting the 5G connection of AT&amp;T? Is there any difference on the 5G capabilities of an Asian/PH version vs a USA version, given that both are using SD 8 gen 1 processor?

Frame Cover Question	Is anyone else using the frame cover from Samsung? I bought one for my S22+, and there's a lot of wiggle room on the sides.

battery life of all three models	I've been using the s22, s22+, and s22 ultra for a couple weeks now, using them all equally, running the same apps and videos at the same screen brightness/phone settings. I don't understand why the s22+ uses so much more battery? The standard s22 has the longest lasting battery of the three so far, and it puzzles me. Wtf is going on?

S22 Ultra - Thoughts on cases I've tried	"I've been using the S22 Ultra for about a week now and have tried eight different kinds of cases. Actually the actual number is ten because I tried two different colours for two of the cases. For reference, my S22 Ultra is in white. I have also measured the weight of each case.
Ranked from least favourite to most favourite:
[**Itskins Hybrid Clear**](https://www.itskins.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-5g-hybrid-clear/) **- P shaped camera cutout, 34.2g weight**
This case actually feels good in the hand, with lots of grippability at the sides while being lightweight. I guess you could say the case is rather protective because it has quite a substantial top and bottom lip. However, it is my least favourite case because:
\- the right side of the case feels loose (you can easily 'peel back' the side of the case) and hence, not very secure; and
\- I feel the sides makes an already large phone feel even bulkier. I guess this is up to personal preference.
[**Otterbox React**](https://www.otterbox.asia/galaxy-s22-ultra/react-series-case/77-86618.html#prefn1=series&amp;prefv1=React+Series&amp;start=1) **- rectangular camera cutout, 43.4g weight**
This is, by far, the most expensive case I've purchased for my S22 Ultra. I like the fact that it has a rectangular cutout (looks better than the P-shaped kinds you see) and it has a very clean look (I got the version with the black borders). The PC backing (which has a micro-dot pattern if you look closely, presumably to avoid the 'rainbow effect') is actually quite thick as compared to say, the Ultra Hybrid, thus making it one of the heavier cases I've tried. That said, despite its weight, it feels very easy to hold because the sides are squared off and has a good grip. Unfortunately, there are two dealbreakers with this case, rendering it unusable for me:
\- the cut out for the speaker sits a bit too high, so you can always see a sliver of the phone's top frame at all times; and
\- it interferes with the Whitestone Dome screen protector.
[**Spigen Neo Hybrid**](https://www.spigen.com/products/galaxy-s22-ultra-5g-case-neo-hybrid) **- singular camera cutouts, 50.1g weight**
This case is **very** protective and covers the individual camera cutouts, **except** for the 3x zoom. This kinda spoils the look a little on a non-black phone but still a hundred times better than a P-shaped cutout.
The case feels quite good in the hand (both the sides and back) and I especially like the soft touch feeling on the sides very much. There's decent lip protection and quite a bit of camera protection on the rear, all the while not interfering with my Whitestone Dome screen protector.
However, this is a very wide case (barely fits in a car mount) and makes an already wide phone even harder to hold in one hand. It's also quite heavy.
[**Spigen Cryo Armor**](https://www.spigen.com/collections/galaxy-s22-ultra-5g/products/galaxy-s22-ultra-5g-case-cryo-armor?variant=40437203533871) **- rectangular cutout, 44.2g**
I'm not sure why Spigen's website lists this for $59, when I got it at less than half the price on Amazon.
This is a really unique design and a refreshing one at that. The back cover feels so nice to touch, with the contoured hexagon circles. I'm not too sure how the cooling claims bear out (I don't game), but I don't think the phone ever felt hot with the case on (can't say the same for the Neo Hybrid. which gets hot easily).
The sides have some ridges to them which I guess is supposed to help with the grip. However, I find it a little bit too slippery to my liking and ironically, the ridges make it a little *more* uncomfortable for me to grip.
While the case is on the heavy side, it still maintains quite a slim profile and is hence easier to hold in the hand as compared to the Neo Hybrid. The rectangular camera cutout is also a refreshing change from the P-shaped ones and looks quite good on a white phone.
[**Spigen Ultra Hybrid**](https://www.spigen.com/collections/galaxy-s22-ultra-5g/products/galaxy-s22-ultra-5g-case-ultra-hybrid?variant=40436993720367) **- P-shaped camera cutout, 35.2g**
A very light case and one of my favourites from my S21 Ultra and Note 10+ days. The sides are a bit slippery (despite the soft touch material) but the grip on the back makes up for it.
I tried firstly the new [frost black](https://www.spigen.com/collections/galaxy-s22-ultra-5g/products/galaxy-s22-ultra-5g-case-ultra-hybrid-matte?variant=40436996505647) version, which didn't look very nice on my white phone, before switching to the matte black verison, which looks considerably nicer. There is also a crystal clear version which I did not try (curious if the grip on that would be better, but I was afraid that it would yellow).
While the sides are a little slippery, the sides are quite thin and so, the phone remains easy to hold in the hand. The P-shape camera cutout is a definite minus (although better looking in person than in photos), but at least it is thick enough to provide decent protection to the camera lenses.
[**Caseology Skyfall**](https://www.caseologycases.com/products/galaxy-s22-ultra-case-skyfall?variant=39559749468234) **- rectangular camera cutout with additional 'protection', 35.0g**
I opted for the Royal Black version, which has translucent smoke black sides and rear on the camera lens area. I like this case because of its unique take on the camera cut-out design. I wanted the Royal Clear version for my white phone but I could only find the Royal Black and Royal Rose Gold. The Royal Black looked pretty decent on my white phone, though.
If you're coming from an older phone, you may wish to note that the Skyfall this time round is a single piece TPU/PC design (unlike the older ones which had a plastic bumper similar to that of the Neo Hybrid). There are some 'ridges' at the side which helps with the grip and it feels really, really good in the hand. One of my favourite cases. Only con is that there is a wee bit of give at the right hand side near the power button (which makes a 'click' sound occassionally when you press the side of the case against the phone).
Curious to see how the sides will hold over time (whether it will yellow).
[**Spigen Thin Fit**](https://www.spigen.com/products/galaxy-s22-ultra-5g-case-thin-fit-1) **- singular camera cutouts, 30.1g weight**
This case is amazing. Superb feel and fits like a glove. Not too slippery on the back and very grippy at the sides. Barely adds any bulk to the phone, yet the essentials are protected -- slightly raised camera bumps and front lips. I think it would survive light falls but don't take my word on it.
The singular camera cutouts (except for, unfortunately, the space in between the laser LED and 3x zoom lens) look really great on the phone.
This would have been my favourite case, if not for the fact that it's only available in black and the camera protection on the rear is ever-so-slightly wanting. It'll probably be a case I'll use down the road when I'm not so concerned about babying my phone any more.
Which brings me to my favourite...
[**Ringke Fusion**](https://www.ringkestore.com/products/galaxy-s22-ultra-case-fusion) **- P-shaped camera cutout, 31.5g weight**
In spite of the P-shaped camera cutout, this remains my favourite case for now. I first purchased this in Smoke Black, until I realised Ringke also sold this with a 'matte' (actually, frosted) back cover.
The version with the frosted back cover looks absolutely amazing on my white phone. Plus, it has very good grippability all around, and the contoured edges should help in the event of any minor fall. The only concern, of course, is whether it will yellow over time. But for now, I'll use it while it lasts!"	N
rant - Samsung support is SO BEYOND GARBAGE that i'm tempting to switch back to iphone	"Just got s22 ultra, slight physical damage on it. I spoke to samsung support online and they said since it is just recently purchased I can get it fixed for free at a 3rd party location. Well i showed up, they said number 1 we wouldn't do it for free, and number 2 we don't even have any parts for this phone yet. I've spoken to like 10 fucking people and have been on multiple phone calls. ""you can call the sales team they'll do a replacement for free"" now the number they give me is absolutely wrong. Nobody can speak english properly on the live chats. Nobody knows what they are doing on the phone.
&amp;#x200B;
JESUS FUCKING CHRIST SAMSUNG! THIS SUPPORT IS WORSE THAN FUCKING VERIZON/ATT/TMOBILE
&amp;#x200B;
&amp;#x200B;
&amp;#x200B;
update: Demanded replacement just like people in the comments were recommending. It took me multiple hours over multiple days (and a SEVERELY inconvenient useless trip in person) to finally get to the right person , but at least they're giving me $400 credit. I'd rather have not gone through this and just got it fixed. I wish there was Samsung store like Apple store. Oh well.
&amp;#x200B;
&amp;#x200B;
second update to clear things up: I  realized my post wasn't clear. I was the one who caused the physical damage. That's why i was reluctant for asking for a return. I explicitly stated that i caused the physical damage and so that when they said they would repair it for free, I just went ahead and listened...you know, because why wouldn't I. "	N

FYI - you can choose from more screen modes than just Vivid or Natural	"Previous Galaxy devices had more screen modes than just Vivid or Natural. AMOLED Photo, AMOLED Cinema, and Basic.
I always found AMOLED Photo a good balance between the over-saturated Vivid and somewhat bland Natural.
To set one of these other screen modes, you just need to run a simple adb command. But first you must set the screen mode to Natural in display settings. Then run the following adb command.
**adb shell settings put system screen\_mode\_setting #**
Where # is:
* **0** AMOLED Cinema (DCI P3 target)
* **1** AMOLED Photo (Adobe RGB target)
* **2** Basic (sRGB target)
* **3** Natural
* **4** Vivid
After running this command, you then need to go into Settings &gt; Display &gt; Screen Mode, then back out of Settings. This will apply the screen mode.
I'm not sure how accurate these settings are on the S22, whether AMOLED Photo is close to Adobe RGB etc...but it certainly looks more pleasing on the device.

Unlocking a carrier locked ATT S22	"So, I just wanted to post this in case it is relevant for anyone.
I bought a carrier locked ATT S22U from Samsung directly.  I didn't want to be on a payment plan locked in with ATT in the event I decide to switch in the future. 
So anyway, I bought the phone out right after trade in, and I've had it a week or so now. I decided to request a carrier unlock code from ATT just to get that out of the way so I don't have to do that in the future if it ever came up.
I made the request via this link https://www.att.com/deviceunlock/
And once the code arrived, a few minutes later it gives instructions on what to do, I took a screenshot of that for my records.
Well it says to insert the new carriers sim, to get a pop up window where I can enter the unlock code, I don't have that I'm not switching at the moment.
So, the following code entered into the phone dialer gets you to the needed prompt where you can enter the device unlock code from ATT.
#7465625*638*#
After being entered it lets you know it was successful.
**Unlocked software differences I've noticed, this is entirely separate from the above. But since conversations in this post went this direction I wanted to add this info here.**
Edit: I decided to flash the unlocked software, a few things are indeed missing or are different for att. I'll make a list below of confirmations of features that I think are relevant to know.
WiFi calling does seem to work, at least it doesn't argue and it shows the feature turned on.
Visual voicemail is a separate apl, not integrated into the dialer now.
Att video call is removed entirely (replaced with Google duo, more universal if the people your wanting to video call with use duo.)
Att bloat is now not included 
Google messages rcs now goes through Google/jibe, instead of att. Which also gives it a bigger messaging size limit.
I'm prob going to stick with the unlocked now that I've switched but I don't think the carrier firmware is bad at all. A few more items to disable due to att bloat but not too much. And I did like the dialer before with the integrated voicemail."	N

Samsung UK: Anyone else's pre-ordered S22 denied to be collected while stores had stock for walk in buyers?	"How's every one taking deliver/collection of their pre-ordered S22/+/ultra in the UK?
I ordered mine on 16th of February, with a collection date of 12 March from King's Cross, London. Walked in to the Samsung store to collect only to find out that:
1. My phone was not delivered to the store
2. Phones on the store were for walk in buyers so they could not use that stock for online purchases.
3. Purchases on the store could not price match or make use of trade-ins.
So I left without a phone, while having pre-ordered it almost a month earlier. In the mean time any one could walk in and buy one.
I was told to wait for the email. Today is the 14th, still no email, still no phone.
It's like making a reservation at a restaurant, and being turned away, while others could walk in and be served.

The "Green" S22+ is actually blue with a green metallic, change my mind.	"Received my S22+ last week and I absolutely love it coming from my Pixel 5. The design is so premium and it just feels so solid. The Green naming scheme is definitely a lie. Still waiting for my case to arrive so I'm risking it with no case right now which has allowed me to really enjoy the feel of the back glass. Only thing is that I'm now 100% sure that this actually a blue phone. Unless you're in direct sunlight or hold it at a certain angle the phone is definitely blue. Am I just colourblind 😂.

Looking for S22+ phone case that is waterproof/tough af	I'm a heavy equipment mechanic and I'm constantly outside in the rain and dirt.

S22 Ultra first impressions.	So I primarily use 2 phones, s20+ (for work) and note 10+ (for media consumption). Both of my phones were the exynos variant. Waited a few years for the next note to replace my note 10+ and when I saw the s22 ultra, i was immediately sold. When I knew that this year my country is getting the snapdragon variant, immediately bought the phone upon the launch and I'm not disappointed. 8-9hours of SOT with QHD and 120hz on is simply amazing compared to my s20+ 4-5hours screen on time. Although the chipset might play apart in the battery life but boy oh boy am I glad to have purchased the s22 ultra.	N

Any thoughts? Is the S22U curved display toddler proof? Meaning it's actually more durable than it looks and can afford some bangs or drops, with case?
Edit 1: My kid is just 1yo+ and I wish I could speak some sense to him. Plus I guess the emphasis here should be more on the phone rather than how to keep my phone away from my kid?"	N

Delay S22 series	I pre-ordered the S22+ 256 GB in green, but the estimated delivery date keeps getting delayed. I ordered it from T-Mobile. First moment of delivery was estimated to be on the 11th of March. The estimated time from the moment you ordered depends on the color and the internal storage. But it ranges from at least 6 weeks to 10 weeks(!), which means that the earliest moment I'll receive my phone will be mid April.. The big problem here is that my current phone, the S10, has tons of issues with google for example not syncing my account anymore, google apps crashing and being able to make a back up anymore, so I really need a new phone now. Does anyone know exactly why it keeps getting delayed? Should I just cancel this order and just order another phone? Or should I just wait it out? What is a good alternative?	N

iPhone to S22+?	"Hello friends. 
I’m here to maybe gather advice? Insight? I dunno. I’m currently on an iPhone 13 pro max. 
TLDR version? I’m bored. 
Long version?
I am really considering upgrading to the S22+. If the ultra didn’t have a curved screen I’d likely do that one. I also considered the pixel 6 but they’re not doing good after doing some research. I’m not tied into apples eco system, I only have ear buds and an iPad that I only use for shows and procreate. I have a gaming PC and do all my photo editing and such on that for social media (with the exception of stories and such). I mainly use my kindle app, audible, Reddit and scroll on tiktok, ig and fb. When posting I’m sharing photos that were taken with a professional camera. I don’t use airdrop because again, my computer isn’t apple. 
I’m really bored and really craving the customization that comes with androids since I actually am sort of needing those functions with being an arc reader for authors. I really don’t use apple apps (calendar, iCloud, mail).

Samsung s22 ultra screen protector thread!	Hello ultra users, I've come across a couple of tempered glasses for my previous s21+ and I've seen they haven't been able to detect the finger print and now that I have an ultra I want suggestions from you guys which screen protector or tempered glass will work with S pens and finger print and everything?	N
List of Pros and Cons for the S22 Ultra	"As the title of the pros and the cons of the S22 Ultra. Quick aside before the list starts; I have the 256 GB/12 GB RAM US version with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. Also I have only had the phone for 2 days, so things that other people notice, I may not have noticed yet. It's always a bit sad to have a post end on a sad note, so I will list off the cons first, and then I will discuss the pros.  
Cons:  
1. The removal of the camera bump in favor of the five elevated rings on the rear surface of the phone. Many reviewers have already said the same thing, so I'll summarize, ""The spaces in between the lenses allows dust to cover the sides of the camera rings"". Also not all cases solve this problem, since they have a cutout that doesn't cover each individual lens.  
2. The curved display. I used to have the Samsung Galaxy Note 20, and even for that phone's many shortcomings it had one thing that I did like; the flat display. A flat panel is more conventional and causes less frustration with palm rejection.  
3. The lack of a charger included with the device. For the price that this phone goes for, there is no excuse not to include the charger. Samsung does their customers a disservice by not including a charger in the box. Especially since this phone supports 45 watt fast charging. So to advertise super fast charging and not include the charger raises a few questions.  
4. The MSRP. The Manufacturer suggested retail price for the S22 Ultra is $1200, before any trade in or carrier incentives. In the day and age where you can get other android mid tier devices for $600 even $700, twelve hundred is a bit of a big ask.   
5. Exclusive colors. The exclusive colors on Samsung's website are neat, however it's kind of a shame that the only place you can get them is on their website. It's also worth noting that a lot of folks who have ordered custom colors are experiencing some kind of delay. The Graphite, Blue, and Red should be available on every carrier.  
Pros:  
1. S-pen. Whether you're using it for doodling, scrolling, air actions, or just to tap small buttons on a web page, the s-pen is a clear winner. The reduced latency is really noticeable and helps with scribbling, or signing documents. Writing with it, or drawing with the pen feels close to traditional pen on paper. And the button on the S-pen is re-mappable to launch other apps, depending on a press, double press.  
2. Display. Samsung has a long history of successes with displays and this phone is no different. The 6.8"" panel is great for consuming media, playing games, or even just looking at webpages. I didn't feel the need to turn the display all the way up to 1440p, since it looks fine on Full HD+. The one option you will notice is the 120 Hz high refresh rate display, it makes scrolling so much smoother.  
3. Battery. 5,000 mAh is certainly a big number, and it performs as well as you'd expect. Over the two days I've had the phone, I didn't kill it on either of the two days. However, by the end of the first day I did have to charge it as I did do a rather heavy gaming session on it. Also since the battery adapts to your usage, your battery life is going to be different.   
4. Performance. This shouldn't be a surprise, but this phone handles heavy tasks with confidence. With the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, I never felt an inkling of hesitation or slowdown. The processor paired with the 12 GB of RAM basically ensures that I never have to go easy on the phone.  
5. Wireless DEX. What I feel is a truly underrated feature of Samsung phones is DEX. Now I have only used it on a TV, but my goodness is the experience amazing. It's intuitive, it's fast, doesn't stutter, and enables you to use your phone while you're busy on a bigger screen. The thing I use it for most is to access desktop websites on the phone and have the extra screen real estate on the television."	N

Announced that this week will get my S22, but got just the Earbuds	I've got a mail few weeks ago in which says that my phone will be delivered this week. On Monday I've got another mail saying that my products are on their way, so I assumed that I'll get both of them, but no. On Thursday I got only the Earbuds... It is kind of annoying to pre order something and getting it later than someone that buys it from a store.	N
Confused about refresh rate on galaxy S22 Ultra	So, I just received a galaxy S22 ultra phone today and I turned on the show refresh feature in the developer setting and I can only see the refresh rate dipping to 24htz on a static more, as far as I know, Samsung advertises that Ultra can go as low as 1htz.

My Ordering Experience	"Bit of a ranty post, but just wanted to share my experience that some of us here know all too well at this point.
Placed my order through Samsung Canada on Feb 14th.
S22 Ultra 256gb Phantom White, Trade-In (S20 Ultra 128gb), Double the Storage, 50% off Samsung Care, $100 Voucher Code and 15% through S+ Rewards Program. Total cost $1045 taxes in.
After an entire month of watching my order not even budge from ""Processing"" and ""Arrives 02/22/2022"", no communications from Samsung whatsoever, and multiple chats with Customer ""Service""... My god I knew it was bad, but I didn't know it was downright abysmal. Constant lies ranging from ""you'll get an update in 24-48hrs"" to ""just wait another week"" to ""I've sent your order to the fulfilment team and they will update you by the end of the week"", to telling me the reason for delay was because I ordered a ""limited edition"" model (not once, but TWICE lol). 
Even trying to get them to cancel my order was a headache in and of itself and I'm not convinced in the slightest they even did that properly since it's still ""processing"". Since customer service was less than useless, I fired off a mighty long email to their support team expressing my frustration with the whole experience but I'm sure nothing will come out of that either.
Would've loved to have been part of the gang, but I can't help but feel discouraged seeing exclusive orders ship out, others getting their non-preorder devices less than a week after ordering... etc. Seems like there was little incentive to pre-order this year aside from discounts to drive more sales, and that's exactly what Samsung got. Bummed that I'm missing out on such a good deal but it is what it is. Gonna hang on to my S20 Ultra a little while longer, which is still powering along aside from camera focusing issues and slightly worse battery life over the years.
Enjoy your new toys fellas, I'll stick around and live vicariously through all the crazy Space Zoom shots and pet pics.. 👋🎩"	N

Anyone got a clue what's going on here? (Explanation in comments)	"Hi, 
Bit of a weird one, I've just had an email through from Samsung saying my orders been delayed.
Thing is, I never actually made the order. The orders for the tab 8 ultra and 512gb s22 ultra. Weird thing is, there's trade in discounts for my current devices (imei matches and everything) and the delivery address is my house.
There's no pending payments on my accounts at all, is this an error on samsungs end? I did toy with a tab 8 ultra at the time, but cancelled the order shortly after due to buyers regret. But this orders completely different.
Would be happy to receive the items if they ever appeared however not if they're gonna take the best part 1.3k.

First I seemed to have tried to pop my sim card tray out by the microphone hole, but the mic seems to work and from what i read its not a straight hole to the mic. 
My second problem is with Google Chrome on my new S22 plus. I have two google accounts. I had forgotten I had the first one that was used for my Samsung phone (from s7, s9 and s20 plus now my s22 plus) and my Samsung 4 watch classic. My computer google chrome is under my other google name. On my old Samsung s20 plus google chrome was set to my second Gmail and synced with passwords and history on my pc browser.  However now on my S22 plus it shows my two google accounts, but chrome keeps defaulting to my other google account. When I go to a website it has no saved passwords for websites. How do I lock the phones chrome into my second google address? 
I set it to my second google account and then the passwords say no saved in my first account. Also the google chrome says it needs to update. I hit update and it spins for a second and then does nothing. So it keeps saying it wants to update."	N

Trying to comprehend the Custom Colour order progress bar.	"Context: I ordered a Graphite S22+ on February 9th. Samsung Canada said it would show up in March 2nd, I still haven't gotten a tracking number. Samsung Support has been largely useless, as seems to be the theme. 
Here's what I've gathered so far:
Samsung's arrival dates are clearly more aspirational than anything else. They seem to be using a pull manufacturing process.
""1 - Order placed"" is largely self explanatory. 
""2 - Customizing"" seems to mean the device is being assembled, perhaps in Korea.
""3 - Ready to ship"" seems to mean the device is ready to make it's way to a warehouse in the country where the device was ordered, not ready to ship go you. The date support gave me for when my device was completed corresponds with the Ready to ship date. 
""4 - On the way"" seems to include the 3 first steps from a normal order: Order placed; Preparing for dispatch; On the way. In other languages it's translated to ""On the way to your country""
The date Samsung told me my device was shipped to the warehouse was the date where it moved to On the way. About a week later the status changed to ""Preparing for Dispatch"" from ""Preparing"" even though it hasn't moved from ""On the way"" and I've yet to receive a tracking number. I have to assume the next change to the status will be to properly ""On the way"".
""5 - Delivered"", I guess we'll find out when it shows up. 
It seems they should have another couple steps in there to make things more clear. Or at least give their support personnel more than just a series of platitudes to copy paste into chat. 
Does anyone else have more insight? Have any other Canadians received their custom colour S22's yet? What's your experience been like?"	N

Some of this is confusing because I'm sure all of the Spotify/Youtube/Sirius/etc. is included in those discounts and I'm just not sure which is which or how to calculate it. Plus I think I got a $250 discount for bundling both the tablet and phone but it says $155.86 for some reason? I don't want to cancel if I'm going to pay a lot of money to get the 512GB version but wanted to factor in how much a refund would be in the total cost. (I wouldn't even be doing this if they just ship my phone but it is what it is at this point). Anyway, I'd appreciate any insight to this."	N
"Swipe to open" from lock screen is a bit obnoxious. Anybody know a way to bypass?	"When you're on your lock screen and the phone is unlocked by Smart Lock (say, location), if you tap once on a notification to go into it, the screen goes black and says ""Swipe to open"" - see screenshot here:
[https://i.imgur.com/V12OB0h.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/V12OB0h.jpg)
Coming from a Pixel (yes, I know, my second post in regards to that), it's kind of annoying and seems poorly executed. If I did the same thing on a Pixel, it would take me straight into the app, no swiping necessary. 
I understand it's probably for accidental touches in a pocket or something, but does anybody know a way to skip that ""Swipe to open"" screen?
Thanks all. Loving this phone otherwise."	N

S22 exynos - framedrop/lag experiment findings.	"Hello people of reddit - my first post in this sub. Sharing some experience and also asking for help.
This is my first Samsung phone - S22 base  - exynos as i'm based in the U.K. Previous phone was oneplus 9 pro.
I am loving the S22 so far however have a very specific peculiar issue with framedrop/stutter/lag. Compared to other forum users, my experience has been very smooth however I noticed when changed my wallpaper to the live wallpaper green and red one(have attached my lockscreen so you can see the wallpaper) every so often it would stutter and the live wallpaper animation would slow then resume normal speed but this jarring difference is easily seen when I wake up the phone to the locker screen.
This seemed every odd as how does a 2022 flagship phone from one of the biggest manufactures stutter on a 1st party wallpaper that is included by Samsung themselves. I understand phones drop a frame on heavy tasks but waking a phone is pretty normal? My previous oneplus did not stutter once so am kinda intrigued. Everytime i locked the phone and woke the screen, it would be smooth so wasn't sure how it happened every so often so I experimented and found  a way to make it more. reproducable.
Here is my method. 
I tried all the 1st party wallpapers firsts - Static wallpapers are all fine. Live wallpapers are also all fine except the red and green [https://ibb.co/HChY822](https://ibb.co/HChY822) and the greenish yellow one with the same style. The other live one with white background are all of similar style and do not stutter.
Now I identified the 2 wallpapers that did this. I did some further investigation and found this only occurred when I used double tap to wake function and not when the power button was used to wake the screen.
Next I noticed, it only occurs when you have AOD to show on tap to display so when you double tap to wake, the clock moves from where the AOD clock in different position ([https://ibb.co/fSVLnxg](https://ibb.co/fSVLnxg)) then moves to default position on the lockscreen. Next to reproduce it, open the camera or playstore or whatsapp and quickly go to the home screen, lock your phone then double tap to wake. The animation stutters almost 40 - 50% of the time. If you're not quick enough it will not stutter. 
So to recap, AOD on to show on tap, wake and lock using double tap. Those 2 specific wallpapers only. All other options have been fine for me. 
Of course this is insane but this is just to try to reproduce the problem. It mostly happens 4-5 times a day naturally and I am aware, I could just use a another wallpaper (all the other that don't lag or even static one) or just use the lock button or just turn off AOD. I am actually more intrigued if anyone else has had these issues and how a 2022 flag has these issues.
I think this is the due to the clock moving from it's position on AOD to default lock screen position and is more to do with the adaptive refresh rate than maybe lag? What do you guys think? Does anyone know why those specific and why specifically with the AOD.
Anyone else using this same wallpaper having framedrop/stutter/lag issues on waking the phone using double tap? or even with any other wallpapers?
Would also be grateful if any of you wonderful people can try out these two wallpapers and report back if any of you having the same problem? 
Which version are you using? Snapdragon or exynos? Maybe only the exynos are having this issue?
It's a minor issue but i'm wondering if i'm the only one affected. Would like to exchange my phone if this is only happening to me.
Thanks. Looking forward reading your comments. 
Tldr ; Found 2 wallpapers that lag/stutter every so often. when using AOD tap to show and double tap to wake function otherwise a smooth experience on S22.  Asking for help - for people to try out these wallpapers to see if I'm the only with this issue."	N

Insight on Battery life wanted (s22 s22+ s22U)	"Hello folks. I have ordered the s22+ because based on my research it provides the best battery life of the three available models. However I have been second guessing myself frequently due to varying reports I've seen. 
Can anyone offer some personal or researched insight into the battery life's on the three Snapdragon versions of the phones?

For those who waited on their preorder bonus... how long after your phone arrived did you receive it?	"So my phone finally comes tomorrow, I ordered the Graphite S22 Plus, which took a little longer. I also elected to save my $200 in preorder credit until after I received the phone as I wasn't sure what I wanted to get. Fortunately, I've decided to go with the Galaxy Buds Pro, which are luckily enough $50 off at the moment and come with a free charger, plus an extra $30 if you trade in your existing earbuds. I then can use the leftover amount to possibly upgrade my Galaxy tab.
Unfortunately, per a Samsung rep I just spoke with, it will take up to 14 business days before I receive my preorder credit, by which time the deal will almost certainly be over. However, the key phrase is ""up to"", meaning it could get here before then. Since those who didn't opt for the custom colors have had their phones for a couple weeks now, how long after you got the phone did you get the credit?"	N
Is there anybody from Puerto Rico that has recieve their phone from Bestbuy?	"I pre-ordered the base S22 (Green) since Feb 11 and there hasn't been any updates about it since then. They just told me just to wait for the email to pick it up. 
Already expected a delay due to the shortage and huge amounts of pre-orders and thats why I waited and waited and went there on March 2nd. They told me that Samsung hasn't sent any phones and told me to try to comunicate with them(Isn't it supposed to be them?). I comunicated wity Samsung US and they told me ""We are not the ones that ship to Puerto Rico."" 
So then I got to Samsung Latin America and asked them, they told me ""We don't know what is currently happening."" 
I check T-mobile and they have it. I go to Claro PR and they have it. I got to AT&amp;T and they have it. Then there's Bestbuy with nothing."	N

No Band 14 on S22?	"Switching from unlocked Fold3 to AT&amp;T S22. Excited to make calls again (VoLTE), and to actually use 5G.
Problem is, S22 &amp; S22+ don't have FirstNet Band 14 (only the S22 Ultra), so question is, what am I losing with that? Thanks in advance!"	N
Unlocked S22 Not Getting 5G	I got a new S22 on the 8th of this month, but 5G hasn't been working the entire time. I've been back and forth with AT&amp;T over the last few days, and they finally created a case today. I tested out a Pixel 6 a few weeks ago and it worked fine, but they still made me change my old plan and SIM. The BYOD list was just updated and now says the S22 should get 5G, VOLTE, and WiFi Calling. But I'm thinking something on the network hasn't been updated properly and is still blocking the phone. Anyone else having this issue with unlocked devices from Samsung? A quick google search showed me what sounded like the same issue, for a couple of customers on the AT&amp;T forum, but I get a 404 error when I click on them. I think they've been taken down.	N

Galaxy S22 Snapchat camera quality	"Hello!
Those of you who have a Galaxy S22 (not Ultra), does it still just screenshot the camera preview and look generally terrible when using Snapchat? Is the video still 15fps in dark rooms? I'm on a S9+ currently, and compared to my girlfriends iPhone 13 the S9+ looks absolutely horrible in Snapchat. 
I've seen videos on the Ultra not really improving that much, but nothing on the base S22 which is the one I'm thinking of buying.
Thanks!"	N
Upgrade to S22 Ultra?	"I'm still using my Note 8 and I don't have any issues with it, except outdated software.
Battery still lasts me a full day with anything from 30% - 50% to spare when I go to sleep and put it on charge.
I mainly use my phone for browsing the internet, reddit, calls, texts and jotting down a few notes with the s-pen, so an s-pen is a must.
In SA, we only got the exynos chips, until now, which is also a reason why I'm still on my Note 8 when the exynos chip was still on par with snapdragon. The S22 is the first one we can get with the snapdragon.
I feel that the latest and greatest features are not worth the price, since I have a Tab S7+ with all the latest and greatest features.
Dex on the Note 8 is slow and very outdated, but I don't use Dex on my phone, since the Tab is more convenient for that.
In short. I don't need a new phone, but is there anything that the S22 Ultra offers that warrants its price to replace a perfectly running and functional Note 8."	N
Why can't we have S22 features in a smaller phone?	"Long time Note/Note ultra user so I recently upgraded to the S22 Ultra. But I'm finally acknowledging how cumbersome it is to hold these larger, awkwardly tall phones. Even with a pop socket I find myself propping my phone on my pinky for stability.  I saw someone mention how sometimes they get bad quality pictures because they lose stability as they try to handle the phone and press to shoot....yeah been there often! I can't one hand my phone without nearly dropping it, not exactly great in an emergency.
It's always been a struggle but it's just all the sudden hit me how frustrating it is and that it used to be a lot nicer when I could actually casually hold my phone without feeling my wrists be overtaxed. Or when I could fit them in my purse or pocket...what a dream!
Thinking about returning the S22 Ultra for a S22, but nervous and sad to leave the good features of the Ultra line. Will best features always be reserved for the biggest phones? Why can't we have them in smaller phones?"	N
IMO, UAG Monarch for the S22U is a beautiful case, but is this corner its weak point?	"GIF for reference: https://imgur.com/a/hIKBwO9
Out of the four corners on my Monarch UAG case for my s22 ultra, one corner for the camera side is flexible, while the other three are rigid. I can see how it'll survive a huge drop from those three other corners, but I'm not so sure it'll survive shatter free if dropped on the flimsy corner.
My other cases from Samsung, the rugged and clear standing ones, don't bend as easily as the Monarch's one corner for the camera.
For a premium case, is this acceptable?
I think I'll still stick with UAG, but I'm reconsidering keeping the Monarch, especially since the sides are also slick."	N

This product designed for iPhones seem to be very highly regarded. 
Anyone here have any insights into this protector?

Gesture option	I just bought the s22 ultra after a horrible brief experience with the pixel 6 pro. The only thing I really enjoyed from the pixel was the gesture option for navigating. Does the ultra have that option without using the 3 symbols on the bottom? Is it similar if it has it?	N

This is intimate from Artificial Intelligence Video Digital Image Stabilization (AI VDIS) which is 4x faster in analyzing device movements and user conditions, for example when walking or running.
That way, the resulting stabilization becomes more optimal, allowing users to create more stable videos like using a professional camera. In addition, 58% wider Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) to capture more variations in the direction of light also makes recordings clearer, including at night.

Dictation on the S22U	"Just got my Green 256GB (amazing colour) S22U and I love it, cameras are amazing, screen is incredible and a big upgrade from my Pixel 3.  
One thing I did use a lot on my Pixel 3 was voice commands/dictation. Easy way to hands free reply to messages and such, even when I slipped out of ""dictation voice"" with clear enunciation it had a really low error rate and text was displayed almost instantaneously. I don't recall doing much to set it up or train it either. It's such a handy way to enter text, search for things and launch things like Spotify.
I find it really lacking on my S22U so far, either through the Samsung Voice/Bixby option or GBoard. It's really slow and the error rate is like 30% on really obvious words even when intentionally speaking clearly and enunciating. Mic quality sounds quite clear in recordings so it feels like definitely a software issue. 
Is there something I'm missing or a way to improve it? Or is the Samsung voice experience just awful compared to Google's phones? It's literally the only disappointment with the phone so far and would love if I could resolve it. Feels kinda wrong that a 3 1/2 year old mid-level phone grossly outcompetes a new flagship on something!"	N

For anyone looking, Visible has some Ultras in stock. $200 gift card for new customers.	"Long post but this launch has taken the cake as one of the worst I've experienced. 
S5 
S6 
Note 4
S9+ 
So this isn't my first time. 
Customer service reps keep giving different answers. 
I pre-ordered a 512 Graphite on launch week. Got an email saying it would be delayed. 
Cancelled it. 
Ordered a Phantom Black. Ship date at the time was March 14th, then 29th. Now April 12th. 
Ordered a Graphite last week because Samsung site said March 18th. Now March 29th. CSR said it will be longer because they take 4-6 weeks to be created. 
#Tonight I was looking on my carriers website and to my surprise they have Burgundy in 128GB, 256GB and Phantom Black in 128GB available by Friday. 
Confirmed their return policy of 14 days with a 14 day return window, so a total of 28 days to send it back to them. 
Went ahead and ordered it. Will send this one back when one of the other phones ship but I will at least be able to use one in the meantime. 
I still don't want to cancel my order with Samsung because they agreed to price match my first order and send a $250 voucher when it ships and I am still getting a great deal on the trade in with the higher trade in credits they offer now. 
TLDR
Im an impatient creature and figured I'd share if anyone was looking for one ASAP and they are offering a $200 Mastercard gift card to new customers."	N

I'm having a hard time deciding between keeping my graphite s22 ultra. Or going back to my 13 pro max.	"Mainly has to do with apple watch/apple pay, and Galaxy watch/Google pay.  The apple watch is far superior when it comes to payments,  being able track and share workouts and even reading and replying to a text. The raise to wake is slow. And usually take 2 sometimes 3 times to see a message. And by that time it doesn't show me.  The Galaxy watch 4 just seems clunky and un polished. Samsung health is a joke. It won't show me my full workout stats with different workouts integrated but it will show me my full weeks workout instead. And show me a bunch of weird heart readings. I like the phone don't get me wrong. Obviously battery life is better on my iPhone but the battery life on my s22 ultra isn't an issue. Yeah it has a few bugs but they're not huge ones and that's not my deciding factor.
The payments. That's a whole different story. I don't like Samsung pay. It's pointless since MST is not around anymore. I prefer Google pay on Android devices. You have to do this weird workout just to get Google pay on the watch. I use wireless payments everywhere except Walmart. Because they don't offer it. I use Google pay on the chrome browser as well. No need to have two wireless payment options. 
The speakers on the iphone are way better in my opinion but the s22 ultras are very good as well. Just not as full. It's livable. All in all I really like the s22 ultra. But the ecosystem is what's deterring me away from using the device and come crawling back to the cult that is apple. Idc about Mac integration.  I have windows and Mac, and I don't really want text messages and other phone data on my laptop when I'm trying to write code and be productive. That's what I use Microsoft teams and slack for."	N

Ur phones also just randomly freezing?	"Out of the box the software was working fine for a couple weeks or so with just one freeze.
Since about a week ago the freezes would get more common and since today I have one freeze every like 30 minutes.
A freeze would go like this: Mostly when turning the screen on, the system stays in lockscreen and all the buttons, aswell as the screen become unfunctional. The screen will still show the frozen lock screen until oneui reboots and I get the message that it did so.
I have found that this issue occurs more often when I have something plugged in to the usb port, namely my usb to aux adapter. But I doubt its the usb, since the issue occours with out it too, although less often.
Any advice would be greatly appeciated."	N

1080p ruining the experience	"Coming from a Galaxy S10+ I was really keen to get a new phone as this old thing is now quite slow compared to the newer models.
I got a S22+ and everything about it is great except for the resolution. Text is blurry... icons are blurry. Even photos are no longer sharp compared to a 1440p display.
I was used to 1440p back on the S6! After almost a decade with high resolution phones why did Samsung downgrade? I'm trying to get used to it but it's laughable how bad it is.
Did anyone else feel like I do and then get used to it?
Even now comparing the phone side by side to my S10+ I feel like I've made a huge mistake."	N
Cracked camera lens glass on Note 20 - Trade in question	"I knew it would happen..

I was wanting to change the fake red to Black or something that looks better/would get here quicker but I guess you gotta cancel the whole order to do that.  My phone was in good condition until the crack.  No issues.
I preordered when they were offering the enhanced trade in/other goodies so I got $600 for the phone.. what will they do with my cracked device?  If I try to fix it with the little $15 kit on Amazon, will it pass as good on trade in?  Any advice?  Thanks"	N

S22 Ultra UK - Should I just wait for these isssues to be patched or try and get a replacement?	"Main issues I'm having are that calls are distorted and crackle a lot then eventually just hangs up.  
In addition to 5G simply not working, like at all. Even if forced on it simply doesn't recive any signal from the tower that is advertised to have it. Could have a 1% chance of being the operator but wouldn't be surprised if it is the phone.
Been trying to contact the operator to see if there is anything wrong with the tower, but all people gotten though to have been dense as hell and seemed to not give me a straight yes/no answer I'll try tomorrow.
Called Samsung a few times and went though everything there and they say the next thing would be a replacement but this isn't the bog standard model either got the Sky Blue 256/12GB so it has to be customly bult and I'm not waiting more for that again really.
Plus I went for the trade in too so either I try and get a replacement and so either I'm going to have to convince them to keep my old S10+ untill they get a replacement or I'll have to go phoneless and I'm not doing that because the phone is like this.
I don't know what I should do. I have Samsung Care + on the phone so that might count for something but don't know if I should get it replaced now because I have both phones. and Can fall back on one but the BS thing is the period is only a week here, I got the phone on Friday so not alot of time."

S22 Ultra Unlocked zero 5G service.	"Just received my S22 Ultra from Samsung yesterday afternoon.

Mine only shows ""LTE"" or ""LTE+"" in the upper right hand corner.
I've replaced the SIM card with two separate 5G cards, reset the network settings, tried manually editing the Access Points (it doesn't seem to let me), and manually selected ""5G preferred"" from the drop down menu in advanced network settings. I've also tried taking it to the AT&amp;T store and they were unable to make any progress.
I've waited over a month for this phone and want to try every option before RMAing it, if I send it back I simply will take the refund and wait for the Motorola phones around August as it will be at least mid-April before I see a replacement.

S22 delivery	"So I know I'm not the only one to be left in the lurch in regards to when this phone is actually being delivered! So I wanted to write this post so we can all moan about it together...
I placed my pre order on Feb 9th and it was due to be delivered March 11th. I was already unhappy as I didn't get so much as a confirmation email after my order! So I had to squeeze that out of them  but all along I was  being assured my order would be with me on the 11th.
Then on 10th March day before delivery , i even changed my work schedule etc... to be home  was told its not coming until UP TO the 25th march. 
I've spoke to them a few times since, I'm at the point now where I actually feel sorry for the agents at customer services, they have about as much idea as we do. They can tell you nothing. It's poor of samsung to not even enable the customer service agents with enough information to attempt to keep the customer happy they've got nothing.

Should I cancel the order for my S22 Ultra?	"I'm currently using an S9+, and I absolutely love the phone, but recently it's started to lag heavily while multi-tasking and last week it actually completely froze twice. So time to upgrade.
If there's no SD card available, I need 512 GB minimum to carry me the next 4 years (I'm currently storing 193GB on my phone now between card and phone and better camera will only make things worse) which means if I stick with Samsung the Ultra is the only option. And people were telling me the Pixel 6 Pro was having massive issues. So I pre-ordered the S22U. 
But now the problems are showing up for people. And it's leaving me wondering, should I stick with it or cancel and maybe get a different phone instead? The big question i guess is, is the phone worth the price to upgrade from an S9+?"	N

Can I use US version S22 in Europe?	"Hello, 
every year Europe gets the worse Exynos version phone while US gets the snapdragon chipset.
I am interested in buying the Galaxy S22 and thought that if I was paying so much money for a phone why get the worse version one.
But now it left a question, will the phone work normally and fully if I bought a Galaxy S22 from amazon in the USA and got it shipped to me in Europe?"	N

S22 Ultra rants and disappointed by Samsung	"Hi there, I received my S22 ultra on February 23rd and I was super excited as I was jumping from Note10+ to S22 ultra after 2 years of using it. I previously owned few models of Oneplus and LG before that maybe G2 back few years ago. Here are some of my disappointment for device that costs almost 1300 USD before tax.
1) They removed MST so you no longer can use Samsung pay on terminals that doesn't have NFC, why remove feature that was making life better for people?
2) I have had plenty of disconnects and reconnects with buds 2 for no apparent reason while listening to music or during an active call but I never had this issue with note10+
3) If I play clip on messenger and backup to open clip from someone else the whole Video freezes and doesn't let me do anything unless I restart the app
4) Although I have Snapdragon version I can see few flickers on display when ""light mode"" is on with Wqhd+ and 120hz mode active
5) RDP app lags so bad that I don't know why this only happens with device with such a beefy spec while my old devices have no issues what so ever
6) I used dongle bought from Samsung for my Sony WH-100XM3 but it doesn't let me turn on ""UHQ upscaler"" feature on
7) I don't know why Samsung phone never feels smooth like Oneplus, it always feels like something is missing or maybe I am just missing Oxygen OS from good Oneplus days
These are some of the issues I found so far, some of you might say reset the phone and most will be fixed but why can't Samsung deliver proper phone like their competitor Apple. Why is it getting worse by worse each day, is it because there is no actual competitor for Samsung in Android ecosystem so they are doing whatever they will. I had high hopes but I am disappointed, if Pixel had latest snapdragon processor and no issues that I keep hearing about I would return this phone and move on..."	N
I know people won't believe me	"I know people won't believe me, but today with continuous use, web surfing, YouTube, bluetooth headphones and WQHD display, I averaged 15 hrs screen on time. I know it sounds ridiculous. And I'll give you the numbers.  
I started at 1:15 pm with 78% battery. And ran the phone non stop. I had YouTube running, sometimes in the foreground, sometimes in the background. I had bluetooth headphones continually on. Mobile data, wi-fi and location on.  
I constantly switched between YouTube, Samsung internet browser and Chrome. At the time of posting this thread, it was 3:15 pm. So exactly 2 hrs elapsed. Battery was down to 65%.  
Doing the math, that is a tad over 15 hrs continuous screen on time. And I experimented this time and set the display to WQHD.  
I don't know how it's possible, but I've been getting these results regularly with continuous use."	N

Samsung only allowing one order per address?	"I placed an order for a Black and a Red yesterday. 
Samsung kept cancelling and I'd get an email saying they couldn't verify my payment information, yet my credit card company says they are all cancelled on Samsungs end and I have a $3,300 available credit line. 
This is the same saved information they have had for over a year and I have an order for accessories that wasn't cancelled using the same exact card. 
Support just sends a link with a cart containing the same items but it keeps getting cancelled after the order is placed. 
I instead used PayPal using the SAME credit card. 
One was approved and the other was cancelled later that night.  When I try using a different card they still cancel it. 
I am not sure what's going on but support has been completely useless. 
One is still good but I also want to place an order for a different color and it won't allow me to."	N

The models for S22 U are: Versions: SM-S908B, SM-S908B/DS (International); SM-S908U (USA); SM-S908U1 (USA unlocked); SM-S908W (Canada); SM-S908N (Korea); SM-S9080 (China); SM-S908E (Asia/Africa)

S22 U Snapdragon (US) SM-S908UZKFXAA: Single Nano SIM + eSIM
S22 U Exynos (EU/CH) SM-S908BZKHEUE: Dual Nano SIM + eSIM

US Samsung Trade In... "Enhanced"	"So, I pre-ordered my graphite 512gb. I thought I was getting an amazing deal. Free storage upgrade. Enhanced trade in for my Note 20 Ultra 5g ($600). $200 to spend on accessories. 
Well..... now the enhanced trade in is $850. Granted, I don't get a watch, which I honestly dont really want or need. But I just went through the cart.
A watch, plus the phone, was about $780. Now, with the watch AND pro earbuds, its $700. Same phone in both transactions. Part of this is because they have a 30% off bundle discount now.
So... how the heck does this work out? Anyone else frustrated that their check out process and discount process is overly complicated and confusing?

S22+ screen protector working with fingerprint scanner	"Hi guys, 
I got my 22 plus two days ago, and i have spent hours in this sub trying to figure out what screen protector to get. So maybe this can help others in a similar situation.
I finally decided to go with the EGV glass one. After the installation, without changing anything, the fingerprint was still working but for like 70% of the time and I had to press harder.
I enabled the touch sensitivity and re-registered each finger twice. Now it seems that the sensor is as reliable as it was without the screen protector. Very fast, and o don't need to apply much pressure.

Just want to share a silly experience with my S22U.	"So every time I would hit any part of the staus area near the camera, I would hear a sound or two that sounded electromechanical.  At first I thought it was the camera for some reason trying to focus on something.  Since I have a wllet case and the cameras are blocked, I thought something was loose onthe inside and was activating it.  Then I thought it was tje front facing camera trying to recognize my face or something, but I don't have that set up.  Regardless, I cleaned the lens area and it went away for a while.  The sounds came back and I dug around some more.
Finally foud that what I was hearing was the screen protector separating from the screen.  When I cleaned the lens, it was fixing the problem temporarily.  So now I will be shopping for a new screen protector and be glad my phone is not really malfunctioning.

While I'm obviously not planning to throw my new phone across any room, I want to feel good about this purchase before I send back my note. Can the S22U be dropped with a decent case and screen protector and stay in one piece?

1st Time "Note" User and S-pen Experience	"I never owned any of the Samsung Note Series. However, I do have an S21 Ultra and after that experience. I couldn't wait to purchase a Note device.
Therefore, once I saw the S22 Ultra came with an S-pen and it had its own slot. I jumped to purchase. Now that I have it in my hands, I am greatly disappointed. It's shorter and thinner than the pen for the S21 Ultra. How the heck am I supposed to use this for writing? Seriously. I have tried a couple times and it's extremely awkward.
Are people actually using this thing? I have long skinny fingers and palm. Is this made for someone with a different size hand? I searched the Samsung Redddit and this one and didn't see thia topic mentioned. Am I the only person that finds this pen uncomfortable? I may have to return the phone. Even though this Green color is gorgeous."	N
I am not even excited anymore about my new S22.	"I preordered the device (regular S22) on preorder day, it said it would take 2-3 weeks which was last week, and it says it arrives on Monday on the website, and when I ask customer service they all confirm that if I havent received a tracking number yet (which I havent) then maybe another week or 2?

I am really tempted to get the s21 fe but i read mixed reviews regarding battery.
Which of the two do u suggest?
thank you"	N
S22 ultra pre order - status is "on its way"	"I ordered my s22 ultra over a month ago now and am waiting for it to arrive. My order status was changed to ""on its way"" well over a week ago but I haven't received any shipping information yet. Anyone else got the same issue?
Just concerned that it's been marked as ""on its way"". I feel as though it should be ""ready to ship"" seeing as I don't have the tracking info yet."	N
Exynos S22 Ultra- did I set my battery expectations too high or is this just poor battery life?	"I've only had this phone a day so far and my battery seems pretty terrible, I've ran diagnostics and the battery is rated as 'Good' so no issues there.
I slow charged it to 100% yesterday- 3hr 19 SOT and 9h 13 off time and I'm now sitting at 43%. How much better does it get with the battery optimisations?
I've come over from the iPhone 11 Pro Max and was honestly expecting better than this as that phone was an absolute battery beast for me. Is this battery life about on par for Android?"	N

Samsung S21FE, S22Ultra, or a different one altogether?	"I'm trying to figure out which phone to purchase. In terms of importance, these are the aspects I look at:
1. Battery daily usage + longterm life
2. Photos 
3. Small amount of daily gaming (about 20m)
Currently I'm mostly thinking of purchasing S21FE version with 8GB RAM/256GB storage, also because I see that S22U are sold out everywhere, and S21FE is available.
In terms of battery, would it perhaps make sense to go for S21U instead?"	N

S22 ultra 512gb red Canada shipping update ordered Feb 9th	"I looked further into this and I do see that your custom color phone has shipped to Canada. It should be a matter of a week or two before it is shipped to you!

Snapdragon vs Exynos S22, much difference?	I am debating getting an s22 but I am in exynos (australia) region which have often been worse off compared to snapdragon version in terms of performance but more of a concern for me is battery tends to be worse off. Just wondering if anyone has info on how good the battery is for exynos compared to snapdragon. S22 not the ultra but any comparison works I guess. cheers!	N
Ordered an S22 Ultra	I went with the Green Ultra with 256 storage, that does mean it will have 12Gig ram right? I did the AT&amp;T promo and traded in an old S6 active I had laying around to get 800 off, which was fine because I had an unlimited plan anyway and was due for an upgrade so I met all the requirements. I really need a new pair of headphones now since my current pair is wired. Are there any good deals on Samsung Galaxy buds and which are the best?	N
Anyone got their s22U in CA, USA yet?	"Anyone in CA or West Coast of the US got their phones yet? Really anything you ordered through the Samsung website. Preordered on Feb 11th, 512gb Graphite. I am still baffled on how these are not prioritize since you know, preorder is suppose to mean something. My current order recently changed from Customizing ---&gt; In Process after 35 days and I have received a charge on my card. I hope I received a tracking number soon with an actual delivery date that doesn't postpone.
Imagine getting a reservation for a rental car, you paid for the service already, and you arrive early but are denied because the person behind you is paying cash. Bruh."	N
Anyone's S22U running hot during games?	"Gaming obviously heats up the phone and drains the battery more than usual but playing ""Bloons TD 6"" seems to destroy my battery life and noticeably heats up my s22U more than usual within 5 minutes of play.  
I downloaded the same game on my old S7 Edge and while it also absolutely wrecks my battery life as well, it seems significantly less hot compared to my S22U.  
With the upcoming throttle removing patch coming to US I'm wondering if I should even bother turning it off in fear removing the throttle will actually just destroy my s22u.  
Anyone else getting this experience or is this just completely normal?"	N
Canada Ontario Shipping experience for S22 phones.	"Hey folks,
Just curious what everyone's experience has been with getting their phone's through l through FedEx? Specially Ontario / Ottawa. (For those who have already got their phone)
I notice alot of people having issues with their steam decks being stolen or phantom delivered, just gets me worried I hope similar issues don't happen with the S22 phone deliveries 😅.

s22+ and s21+ exynos battery life	"Hey guys. Im curious if anyone knows more about battery life on s22+ device? Is it any better (or worse) than s21+, cuz s21+ has bigger battery capacity. New exynos 2200 chip seem to be not so efficient as samsung announced so can it happen that s21+ has longer lasting battery than s22+. 
P.S. i watched some battery draining test for ultra models and a21 ultra was lasting longer than s22 ultra. Can it be the same with plus line as well?"	N
s22 snapdragon or S21 exynos	"Hi, I pre-ordered my s22 and still waiting but I read TONS of posts talking about how shitty is SOT in s22. And some people suggests s21 or S21 FE is better option.

Preordered S22 Ultra with option to trade in but now trade in doesn't show in order	I preordered the S22 ultra through samsung.com for Verizon. When I did the preordered I checked the option for trade in for an S20 Ultra and it said it will give me $1000 bill credit. I got a screenshot of the offer right before i click on checkout. I placed the order, got the new S22 ultra 6 days ago and I never received the information for the trade in. After multiple calls to customer support and e-commerce, they told me it does not show my order included a trade in. I sent them pictures of the screen and they submitted a ticket to investigate. Today I received an email stating they are sorry but there is nothing they cant do. So now I'm **bleep** $2000 (because I did two different orders). and of course now if I return the phone and try to get another offer I wont get that same offer. Have this happened to anybody?	N

Galaxy S22 Ultra - Almost Perfect	Great phone for my needs. I'm not a gamer, but a huge eclectic music and world news fan. I've been rocking this device for about 3 weeks and the first thing I noticed out of the box is how long it holds a charge. Big improvement over my S9.The first camera shot I took was in indoor lighting - crisp and clear like knew it would be. Getting up tomorrow morning to take a photo of the moon setting in the western part of the sky (it was like looking at the sun without burning the retinas).With all of the positives this phone has, I have 2 complaints:1.The particular ringtone I chose for a member of my family was a .wma file. My choice of music player plays it. But as a ringtone - not.2. The in phone FM chip as been disabled by either my provider or the manufacturer. Bad move.My S9 never had these issues. A flagship phone should be uber capable and never sacrifice anything. Period.I got around the missing SD card slot and headphone jack by purchasing a 512 gb phone and a USB C dongle.Has anyone else had these complaints? It's a great phone, but it could be better.	N
Trouble getting promised credit	I have had my phone for over 3 weeks now and still have not received the $200 credit for preordering. I chatted with a customer service rep online about a week ago and he assured me that I would have it in 24-48 hours, but still have not gotten an email or anything about it. I talked to support on the phone earlier today and got the 24-48 hour "promise" again. Has anyone actually received the credit email?	N
Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra Red	Samsung you disappointed us with the color. You stated on the page a red color and is not even close to red. The phone is burned orange in other word is an orange. A representative that I ask "what is the real color of the red phone‽" and he said a " light red". I told the representative are you sure because it looks to me like orange. I took the representative word since there are more close in person to the device. I asked him before purchasing it and I trusted the representative answered and now I regret it.😤 I should it order the gray or even the white. If I returned the device I would have to return the other thing that came with the offers. Really disappointed that what I get to listening to the representative before purchasing.	N

setting up new S22	hi Everybody,I have ordered an unlocked Galaxy S22. Currently have a Galaxy S9 from Verizon. When I get my new S22, should I transfer apps and data from my old S9 to the new phone, or should I not do that and just reinstall all apps from scratch? If I install from scratch, will my text messages still be there if I install the same Google messaging app?I am asking because while transferring everything from the old phone sounds very convenient, I don’t want that process to somehow result in my new phone being slower, for instance if bloatware and who knows what else gets transferred from my old phone. Would greatly appreciate any advice, thank you.	N

S22 Ultra Middle East: screen protector included?	HelloI am tempted to get the S22 Ultra but the lack of a screen protector installed from factory would be a major negative, I don't want to scratch a 1250$ phone while waiting to get a screen protector from China (1 month).One of the shop who sell it here in Lebanon claimed that it comes with a screen protector from factory, but seeing that European and US models don't I have no idea if he's saying the truthSo the Middle Eastern version (UAe,Lebanon,Jordan...) of S22 Ultra already come with a screen protector already on the screen or not?

Samsung you really dropped the ball	with the launch of the s22 ultra you have really dropped the ball what is the point in pre-ordering a phone if it takes 2 months to get it and everybody that walks into a brick and mortar store was able to get it on that day so in my opinion Samsung has really dropped the ball on the launch of the s22 ultra there is no reason for us to have to wait for over 2 months to receive a pre-ordered phone and I am very disappointed in Samsung at this point you have my money where is my phone	N
I need a setting reversed in gallery-forgot how to do	"Hi all. I remember clicking a setting to not keep the original image in gallery when editing an image. So for example, if I take a pic and then edit it and use the S pen and draw an arrow pointing to something, the original image without the arrow is discarded.  
I realise I don't like this but for the life of me I can't remember where this setting is. I've looked under settings in gallery and elsewhere but can't find it.

Google Messages "Trying to Verify" phone number	I can't get it to connect for chat anymore. It was fine when I first got my S22 Ultra and now it won't connect for chat services. It always says "trying to verify" . I've searched the internet for a solution and there are so many people with all different solutions that I don't know what to try, or do nothing. I've read that switching between Google Messages and Samsung Messages may do this, which I was doing to see which one I liked better, and now I'm just stuck. Has anyone successfully gotten past this?

Graphite S22 Ultra snappier than Black?	"I have both the black and the graphite. The latter is way snappier than and has longer battery life. Same settings and apps.

Google Messages Colors?	"This came up peripherally in another thread but did not get answered there and I did not want to take that thread off topic. I do want to make sure I understand this correctly though.  
My understanding is that message bubbles are green if communicating via SMS with someone and blue with ""Chat"", (RCS), communication if the other person also has Chat enabled. However, it is very rare that I ever message with someone and see blue. I think this is because Messages for the S22 still only allows ""Chat"" if you are messaging with another Android user with chat enabled. The reason that only two or three threads in my Messages show blue bubbles and the other 50 or more show green is likely this: 
- Most S22 users cannot yet ""Chat"" across the divide with iPhone users (who generally do have Chat enabled). 
- Most Android users don't understand Chat vs SMS and may not use an app with Chat features or do not have chat enabled. 
Do I have this correct or is there more to it? It is annoying to know about Chat features but not be able to have them for 95% of my communications. I want to make sure there is nothing more I can do on my end other than using the latest, (beta) version of Messages and making sure all chat features are enabled. Thanks!"	N
Samsung smart call (caller ID and spam protection) gone on carrier versions?	I decided to go with the T-Mobile version this year since I got $200 more trade in value for my unlocked Note 20 Ultra than had I chosen unlocked. I was pretty fond of Samsung's native caller ID and spam protection. I know T-MOBILE offers their own, but I found Samsung's to be better. It doesn't appear that the setting is there to enable it on my T-Mobile version. Is there any other way to enable it or is it exclusively for unlocked models?	N

Quick (no) update on Canadian "Exclusive" Order.	"So, I managed to get on the chat early this morning. Here is the detail of my order:  
Graphite 256Gb  
Ordered Feb 14th  
Expected delivery March 7th  
Been ""On the Way"" since March 9th  
Was told 2 weeks ago it would arrive next week (last week), was told last week it would arrive this week. Evidently, absolutely no news.  
Here is what the CS agent had to say this morning:
&gt;*I am being completely honest here. I can see that the statues of your order currently is it is shipped to Canada from the production house and in transit to reach the warehouse, once it reaches th warehouse, it will be shipped in 24-48 hours.* 
What's funny is that at the exact same time, email support answered a request I sent two days ago regarding the same order with this:
&gt;*As I can check production of your order has been completed and it is in transit to warehouse. Please be assured once it is shipped from our warehouse you would receive the update on the delivery status and also receive the FedEx tracking link from our side.* 
Not really helpful, but at least this time they are consistent...  
I probed the chat agent a little bit to try to get some more information and that's where things took a dark turn (although, no one knows if they have any kind of real knowledge about the situation at that point):
Me:
&gt;*Ok, how is it shipped to the warehouse? Is it on a boat from Vietnam? If that's the case, at least I know I have something like 2-4 more weeks to wait.* 
CS Agent:
&gt;*Yes, it is shipped via a boat on March 9th.  It has reached half-way, I request you to please wait for an update till Monday.* 
&amp;#x200B;
Now that I am re-reading my question and his answer, it does feel as if he was just feeding me back the assumption/suggestion I originally asked. If it had ""reached half-way"", there is no way I would be getting any update next Monday since it's been 9 days ""on the way"" so far.  
When I started asking on how do I cancel my order, who to contact etc, he went on full ""please wait until Monday"" repeat mode. I clearly feel that cancelling my order and getting back my money is going to be an ordeal in and of itself."	N

Finger print sensor extremely fast | Since the GOS update	"I can confirm that my finger print sensor is faster than before but not in a normal way... I can literally touch the screen for less than a second and the phone is unlocked.
Is this normal? It's not broken because I have tested it with other persons and works well.
Days before the GOS update I had to press two times or for more time, it was definitely slower or imprecise.
Do you know if the sensor learn in the long term by using him?

It's been a month - what are your reviews now	"So it's been about a month since the phone came out. Now that you've been using it for a while - what do you think? What are the Pros and Cons? Is it a game changer for you? What do you like the most and the least?
I'm still waiting on mine so living vicariously thru all of you. Thanks
Edit: thanks so much for posting the reviews. I didn't expect them to be so all over the place though. Wish I had my phone so I could throw in 2 cents as well. I'm currently using an s10+ and really wanted to do the upgrade, and opted for getting it thru Samsung versus TMobile so I could have the option of changing it out in a yr. I just upgraded my parents too but they got the S22 and s22+. At this point, I'm just hoping some patches come thru that will fix the software issues."	N

Is the back magnetic?	"My ultra is due March 25th and I'm deciding between cases at the moment. I'm wanting a thin, clear case.
I have a magnetic mount on the dash of my car that I've been using since I got my s8+ and I love it. 
I've had to use a 3M metal plate on the back of my s8+ case that makes the case ugly. 
Anyone know if the back of the ultra would hold to a magnetic mount on it's own?
The back of my s8+ without a case had a weak hold and not enough to firmly hold onto the magnetic  mount. TIA"	N
Cases with raised lips on the sides	Does anyone have or know of any good S22 Ultra cases out there that have raised lips on the sides which protect the screen from drops better?

The waiting game	So I ordered a S22 Ultra (Green, 256gb unlocked) on Feb. 20th and have been told it will be arriving on or before March 25th. I am in the southeastern US and am kind of thrown off because I have yet to receive any update on my order (still allows for cancellation) while I've seen custom color orders made within a couple days of mine either receiving shipping updates or the phone itself. I'm just not sure what is going on at this point. Has anyone ordered within the same time frame as me and region had their order delayed into April? If so I might just cancel and try out another phone. I find it crazy I can order same phone with an expected early April delivery time right now and my order made around a month ago will be postponed until around then anyways.	N
Two questions about keyboard and iPhone video messages on the S22 Ultra	"1. I have the S10 but since it was unlocked and AT&amp;T locked out my phone due to the 3G sunsetting, I'm only able to use the S10 for everyone but a phone.  I stopped by AT&amp;T this afternoon to check out the S22 Ultra, and one thing that bothered me was that the keyboard didn't have the built in special characters on them when you press and hold.  Is this all S22 Ultras, or was this just the demo version I looked at that was like this?
2. Before I had the S10 I had the S10+ that I loved but traded it in for the iPhone 13 Pro Max in order to receive texted videos of my young nephews since I was the only one of my siblings with an Android.  I hated the iPhone and after about a month I got the S10.  I saw online that the S22 Ultra possibly has the ability to receive the texted videos from iPhones without compressing them into the ground.  Is this true?  I couldn't find anything confirming but I also saw something about this being a potential but AT&amp;T is lagging behind others in the implementation.
Thank you for your feedback.  (I'm in the US if that matters)
&amp;#x200B;
EDIT: so after some digging, it appears the option: Settings - General management - Keyboard list and default - Samsung keyboard - Layout - Alternative characters, must be turned on to have the long press special characters with the keyboard.  I'll verify that with the S22U when I go again.  Hopefully this was all it was."	N

Cancelled order and sticking with Note 10+ for now.. here's why..	"For the record I have owned Note 5, Note 8, S8 (work), Note 9, Note 10+ and have been mostly happy with all of them.. 
I prordered S22 U 512Gb Phantom Black (CH) and chose to trade in the Note 9, the trade in prices are low here ($90 for Note 9) 
Cancelled because:
- Ordered a month ago, zero change in status and zero communication / indication of delivery time despite calling twice.
- Exynos performance issues listed by many of you here + XDA blog article:
https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-snapdragon-vs-exynos/
- Battery life issues many of you have (concerns me most) 
- I had planned to pickup a Snapdragon when in the US as they are deliverable from amazon / best buy but then found out  US version is a Single Nano SIM - show stopper for me. 
- No MicroSD although I'd rather just have the dual Nano SIM TBH. 
- it's a $1500 phone.. Very few upgrades from the 2yr old S20 Note Ultra you buy for half the price.. apart from camera maybe.. 
I may revisit when Samsung sorts the supply issues out and software updates (hopefully) solve battery issues, it will probably cheaper by then. 
But for now, I'm sticking with Note 10+.

When I first got my brand new S22 Ultra, and went to eject the sim card slot to put my sim card in, I thought I initially pieced right through my microphone. As I put the sim ejector tool into the hole on the left.
I've been searching everywhere on the internet for several hours on this. u/Samsung really shouldn't put the microphone hole right next to the sim eject hole. Thank you so much   [u/ZacksJerryRig](https://www.reddit.com/u/ZacksJerryRig/) Your literally the only personal on the internet that would intentionally do this in the name of science."	N

First Week Impressions. Note 8 -&gt;S22 Ultra	"Things I love:
* Amazing  Vivid Display, Very quick and smooth even in 60hz. 120hz makes it even better!
* Battery Life is much better than Note 8. Getting  avg 7hr sot. 3.5hrs if playing games.
* Jaw-Dropping Camera and Zoom. No idea i was missing out on so many new modes and features.
* One Ui 4.1 is just great. As a note 8 user, I've only experienced the original one ui and was extremely frustrated when one ui 2.0 was getting so many new and awesome features like the not-halfbaked navigation gestures, new good lock and dex features, more complete your phone integration etc. It almost made me want to abandon samsung for only getting 2 updates but thankfully now i have all that plus 4 more OS upgrades.
Things that i find bad/ need improved:
* I think the camera focus is not the best and i've messed up shots because of the delay.
* The Sound and Vibration on this thing is a bit low and i'm concerned i might miss notifications
* Also no notification led (  third party software can help but i don't want to use them) which i miss the most from my note 8.
* No heart rate sensor is also a bit disappointing but i have an active 2 now so its manageable. No Headphone jack is surprisingly easy to let go of.
* I expected more stable wifi with the new wifi 6 on it but unfortunately the stability is not that good especially when playing certain games. I'd probably assume a software patch will fix it. Changing some wifi settings to static from dhcp helps a bit too.
* The Battery is better than the note 8 but I'm a tad bit dissatisfied with it. I expected the change from 3300 to 5000 mah to be a bit more but i guess 120hz does put a strain on battery.
Overall, I'm very happy with the upgrade. Hopefully a software patch will fix some of the more annoying issues like with the wifi."	N

Please help me understand the camera	"When I opened my S22Ultra camera app, I noticed that I only had 1x, 2x, 4x and 6x zooms only. I was confused because I thought we had the ability to zoom up to 100x.
I started playing around until I found I can change the aspect ratio between the following options:
3:4 108MP: It seems this is the only option where it allows me to capture images at a resolution of 108MP, however, this limits the zoom to a max of 6x
3:4: This provides me zoom ability from 0.6x-100x, however, it only captures images at a resolution of 12MP
9:16, 1:1 and FULL: Same as above, images at a resolution of 12MP but with different aspect ratio.
I would like to use the 3:4 108MP, but with the full zoom capabilities (0.6x-100x), is there a way?
Thanks"	N

Question about battery statistics while using the 85% charge limit	The problem with this feature is that the battery statistics isn't right because it doesn't count as full charge. So if you look at the "Since last full charge" it just keeps going without resetting between charging the phone. My SOT is at 1day now, so I've no way of checking my battery statistics for a day now. There's no way of manually resetting the statistics either. Is there anything you can do to solve this?	N

Looking at the Galaxy A53, and I'm wondering why I bought my S22+	"So I got my Galaxy S22+ earlier this week. And I absolutely love it. The screen is gorgeous, the cameras work very well, and the sound quality is great.
But then I see the just-revealed Galaxy A53, and I'm wondering why in the hell I just spent this much money when I could have gotten a phone with similar specs for less than half the cost.
First off, you've got four cameras, up from three on the S22, with many of the same options. The screen is only an inch smaller and uses the same technology, and the processor is only a step down as well. It has an in-display fingerprint sensor, and is water-resistant as well. And oh yeah, it has an SD card slot, something the Galaxy S has been without for some time now.
So can someone explain to me why the S22 is so much better and I'm paying the extra amount? Because I'm seriously considering exchanging it."	N
Ordered S22 128 GB from Amazon India	"Guys, I preordered the S22 Black, on 8th march, the delivery date was 12th - 20th March and the order still isn't packed or even being prepared for packaging. Amazon store doesn't have it in store yet, clearly.
Has anyone else received theirs from Amazon?
I regret ordering it from Amazon, I seriously thought it won’t be an issue and ordering from Samsung might be slow. Also, they had 5k in instant discount.

Initial thoughts / seeking screen tips	"I have been back and forth on whether to upgrade from my S10 Plus and fate forced my hand in the form of a cracked screen so here I am. Initial thoughts are that this is not a big upgrade. The best part is an upgraded camera and the absence of the horrible curved screen. My biggest concerns are that it doesn't look like battery life has improved and despite what people have said I think the screen is worse.
The Fanboys will surely be jumping down my throat but after a few days I can honestly not tell the difference between with the 120 hz screen. What I can tell a huge difference with, however, is the resolution. The resolution is noticably worse than the top setting on the S10 plus to the naked, unskilled eye despite what many have been saying. As soon as I opened Instagram I noticed all the images and videos look kind of blurry (out of focus) and almost like there's a grey fog over the images. Has anyone else noticed this? Is this possibly an issue with the new screen ratio that will be patched by Samsung in the coming months? Or are there settings I can change to improve this?"	N

Does the us s22 ultra allow you too use two carriers at once like the pixel and iPhone?	I’ve been reading that the s22 comes with eSIM functionality unlocked by default. I have t mobile as my personal line and AT&amp;T for work and on the pixel and iPhone you could have one physical sim and one eSIM working side by side from two different carriers. Is that a thing on the American s22 or can you only use the physical or the eSIM or only have them both on one carrier? (Note: this s22 ultra I’m getting is unlocked. No carrier ties.)	N

S21 Ultra vs S22 Ultra Camera	"Hello guys, I just got my S22 Ultra after pre-ordering it on February 9th. I'm upgrading from S21 Ultra which I had only for 9 months but I was very, very impressed by the camera and now I'm comparing the camera of the S22 Ultra with the S21 Ultra and I'm feeling like the S21 has a better zoom and a better quality in x75-x100 zoom.

S21 Ultra (Exynos) vs S22 (Snapdragon)	I'm thinking about buying a S22 Or a S21 Ultra. I really like the S22 but I'm worried abour the battery life.

The S22 cost about 950$ while S21 Ultra costs 1100$. Which one of them has the better battery life? Is it worth the extra 150$? I'm planning on using the phone for 3 years max.	N

Tips and apps for learning to draw on the S22U?	"Proud owner of the S22U (exynos 12/256gb), and I'd like to master drawing with its spen. 
Last time I had an spen was on the note 4 edge (missed it ever since), but it was in its early stages and I never really tried drawing. 
I've been trying few apps: sketchbook, concepts, and the pre installed samsung notes, but all of them have something I don't like. 
I'd love to be able to change quickly between brushes and sizes, and I want to disable hand touch. Is thre any good app that can do that?

Spigen Neo Flex screen protector concerns on S22 plus	"installation went well and it took about 5mins tops. Once applied I used the included squeegee which worked well and I was able to get out all bubbles then I let it sit for about 10mins. 
When I picked up the phone, I noticed small tiny bumps all over (like mini air pockets) all over the protector. Want to clarify it is not super visible, you have to look really carefully to notice it (especially when the display is off). 
It doesn't seem to be affecting visibility when the screen is on, but I am wondering if it needs time to cure or I did something wrong. 
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
Update: After installation and out of fear i decided against leaving the house with my phone. It continued syncing and charging which generated a lot of heat and definitely accelerated the curing process. No more water under the display and all mini bubbles have all disappeared. It looks absolutely flawless now! Thanks for all the advice guys! 🙏  At some point I may switch to the original samsung screen protector and give that a try."	N
iPhone to S22 Ultra	"Hello,

I just can’t decide between s22 or pixel 6 (base version of both)?	"I’m aware that I am in an obviously biased subreddit, but I need all the advice/input I can get. ♡ 
Some tidbits/concerns/etc: 
• i am a power user (i think?) i use my phone all day, so battery life is important to me 
• currently an iphone xs max user (have hated it since day 1) &amp; previous to that i had a google pixel xl &amp; loved it, but it went downhill pretty quickly 
• camera does matter to me, but from what i’ve seen, they’re about on-par other than in motion. which one is better optimized for in app cameras (like instagram &amp; tiktok)? 
• can i customize them both as much as i want? i wanna make it super cute (as in cute themes &amp; stuff) 
• i need something that will last me awhile. i don’t upgrade often 
• which records videos better? 
i think both are pretty phones! i’ve never had a samsung smartphone, so i don’t know how i’ll feel about all of that. i’m nervous bc all the negative things about the pixel 6, but i know people are more likely to post negative things online. lemme know your thoughts ♡"	N
Found S22 For $575, Cancelled Order Due To Battery Reviews	"I found a green open box S22 (clean imei) on ebay and made an impulse low ball bid of $575. I expected them to counter with something in the $600 range but they excepted and I was prompted to make payment.
Yes I know I shouldn't have bid if I wasn't 100% certain but I honestly expected a counter or no response and was still researching and comparing.
Anyway I ultimately decided not to make payment (too late to cancel so my account will just get a strike). As someone who sells on eBay I feel guilty but I can't justify paying even $575 for a phone that can't easily last a full day in 2022.
I love the compact size, design, color, cameras. It's the perfect phone except that small battery. The phone is just way too powerful for anything less than 4500 imo
Anyway just wanted to vent as I'm sure I'm not the only one who is frustrated. I know I could get the s22+ but it will cost more and long term I think that will have battery life problems too.
I'm leaning towards getting the base s21 or s21 fe as a stop gap until they can make a compact phone with reasonable battery life. S21 is the exact same size as the phone I have now (s7 edge) and s21 fe isn't that much bigger. Since these phones will be cheaper and plastic I can just get a very slim case or no case to keep them smaller in hand."	N

Update: well, thats out. Samsungs system is doing the same glitchy bullshit it always does and cancels my order. 
Best Buy currently has a deal on the S21 Ultra for T-Mobile without trade in for 850. Thats great except for its only 128gb. Halfway tempted to try it out except for their BS 45 dollar re-stocking fee."	N
S22 ultra battery sucks.... need better battery saving tips.	"So far personal experience battery sucks on default settings. Can't get thought an average day.... Half a day. 
Right now just tried battery protection cause.... Obvious reasons...
Now how can we get pass a day with only 85%.....
Any good tip besides just turning on Power Saving."	N
Pre-order	What's the point of preordering the S22 ultra and tablet if it can't come on time. No update still on when it's going to be shipped out this is extremely ridiculous. We should get a special rebate for those who still haven't received them yet	N
S22/S22 Ultra/ future releases releases	Dear Samsung,My brother just switched to Galaxy S22 Ultra from Fold 3. One thing I personally noticed that the unboxing experience I had with S9 and S10- the box had chargers, earphones, dongles, but now it is just **bleep** phone. What's the point paying $1200 for a phone but zero fun. At least put the charger and dongles back in the box; your budget phones still have those items. Last but not least, please put infrared blaster and memory storage in upcoming phones. No one has extra money laying around to pay $1700 for 1TB model. Y'all used to be better than iPhone, what happeend??	N
Turn off 5g s22	I'm in an area where there's not a lot of 5G so it causes my browser to get hung up. I'd like to turn it off and I found instructions to do so but I do not have the option that it says I should. I tap on Settings>Connections>Mobile Networks but then I have no option for Network Mode. Any ideas?	N
S22 ultra exclusive color delay	Just curious if anyone else is still waiting for their s22 ultra in the exclusive colors? I pre-ordered on Feb 9th and got the red 1tb version and it was supposed to be delivered on March 8th but of course I got the delayed email and the delivery dates for my freebies keep changing back and forth from March to April. The pending charge is showing in my bank 2 days ago and the on FedEx it just shows the word "master" with no other info at all. Customer service just keeps telling me a bunch of scripted responses so I have no idea when I'm going to get it. I'm in the US BTW. Anyone else in the same situation?	N
Samsung finance stuff	So recently I placed an order for a Galaxy s20 to ultra but decided to cancel it I had just enough credit to get the phone with a few add-ons but I canceled it because I didn't think I needed it right now LOL I had just enough to get the phone in a few add-ons and it said it was on backorder but I canceled it because I didn't think I needed it right away I have only had my S21 Ultra for less than a year but I wanted to upgrade so going through Samsung financing I used what money I had to finance that phone and a few other things does anybody know how long it takes for the finance money to come back into your account after you canceled an order? Still can't find anything on Google about it any help would be awesome	N
Better battery saver on s22 ultra	I've posted this before, but I'll say it again. I am not the only s22 ultra user that really wants a different power saving mode. The fact that in order to turn on any of the battery saving features, I have to give up the refresh rate on my device, that's stupid.It should be an option just like everything else. I don't need a full speed cpu, and I don't need 5g, but in order to turn off either of those, I have to give up 120 hertz. Literally lower the entire experience with the device just to save battery by limiting things I never even need/useYou should have the option to disable 5G without lowering the refresh rate, and you should also have the option to be able to do other battery saving functions without lowering the refresh rate	N

Love This Battery Life!!!	I have now had my s22 ultra for over a week, and after optimizing the settings myself, as well as the phone learning my usage patterns, I believe I would easily be able to squeak out 10 hours of screen on time on a full charge.I have seen multiple people complaining about the battery life, I'll have to be led to believe that that's just a software issue. I've had entire days where all I did was shoot photos, watch videos, edit photos, and play games, and I still got over 6 hours of screen on time on a single charge.Depicted below in this photo is 7 hours and 30 minutes of screen on time, as well as 3:44 minutes of screen off time with about half of all of that being on 5G data.Not to mention, I still have 15% left, and am also using the battery protection mode, which only charges the device to 85%. That means if I were to fully charge, I would have 30% left, which is over 3 hours more, considering I get more than an hour of screen on time per 10%In love with this new phone! 10/10(PS, not using battery saver mode, and I'm at 120hz)	N
What happened to my post?	I put up a post and now it says I didn't and got a message saying it was moved? I also got a message saying to down load some app for updates? Am I missing something?	N
S22 Ultra too Fragile	Had phone for 1 week, feel off my lap and cracked the screen. How is this possible, a $1000+ phone coming from a Company that markets it as having strong Gorilla Glass? Extremely disappointed by the quality and by Samsung's support. They didn't help much, such a hassle to have it repaired too. Had to ship to Samsung's repair center in Texas. The repair will be costing me $312.I advise caution in purchasing such an expensive and fragile phone.	N

Battery life, s22 ultra	This is getting embarrassing, people see I got the ultra but says they've seen people complain about the battery life, isn't this how samsung lost a big portion of users to iPhone when the battery kept blowing up? Do a **bleep**g update before you fall into that same situation...it's becoming a real issue...why is samsung sitting back and doing nothing about it..I shake my on this one...the phone is great but what good is that if the battery isn't stable... you're losing the battle, is this a boss phone or just all hype,be boss you jerks...get off your buts and FIX IT	N

S22/S22+/S22 Ultra Pre-Order and Delivery Tracker	Hi Everyone!It's that time again! Right now, many of you have either already placed your pre-order, or getting ready to. With every major launch, we start an "ordering/shipping" thread where we all track our progress together.As we know, there are many options and ways to order a new device from Samsung and its partners. This year, there are many different offers and deals, and sharing why we pick one over the other may help others make the best purchasing decision for themselves!What we like to keep track of is:- When did you place your order?- Where did you order from?- What model, color, size, carrier?- What device are you upgrading from?- What was the trade in / bonus offer, if any?- What is your estimated delivery date?- Once ships. What is your shipping progress?Personally, I expect to be able to post an update in the next day or two, but at this time, I'm still shopping around. Right now, I'm considering two options, both for the S22 Ultra:1. Pre-Order from Samsung.com. A $250 accessory Bonus, plus exclusive colors, plus the free storage upgrade, plus a decent trade in value for the S21 Ultra. It's a great offer and a reliable place to buy from.2. Pre-Order from AT&T. This one is also interesting. They have the same storage upgrade, but obviously no Samsung exclusive colors or accessory bonus. Right now, they're offering $800 off with a trade in of ANY Samsung Galaxy S, Note or Z device, from ANY year, in ANY condition! This sounds crazy. Even if you don't have an older device to trade in, theoretically it should be very easy to find an older Galaxy S model, like S4 or S5 for cheap, and even if it doesn't work, AT&T is promising to give you $800 off the new device (S22, S22+ and S22 Ultra). Very tempting, the only thing that's stopping me is the installment plan, as you have to stay with AT&T for 30 months to get that $800, since they give it to you in monthly credits over the life of the installment plan.With that said, We would love to know what you guys are getting, from where and then like I said, help each other keep track to monitor deliveries or delays. Please feel free to jump in and share with the class...Thanks,Geno[A quick note. While any and all posts and opinions are welcome here, if you have a specific issue or complaint about, whatever, it might make more sense to start your own thread to get better responses. We like to keep these types of threads for order/shipping progress updates if possible.

This will be the last time I ever order directly again! (Stop using Fedex samsung!)	I have order products online for over 5 years now and have never had an issue until today. I have been waiting for my phone for almost a week now. They keep changing the dates, thinking I'm not going to notice (but i screenshot everytime for my records), customer service is absolutely useless. And to top it all off, FedEx doesn't update their tracking. My package isn't even that far, literally 30 minutes away from my house! and yet theystill haven't delivered it? If i knew this was going to happen, I would have just ordered my phone at best buy, which by the way i have ordered things from on several occasions and have not had any issues! Like i would have had my phone my now.	N
Getting frustrated	It's mid March my Google Fi Samsung Galaxy S22 plus hasn't gotten the Feb security patch. It's on Jan still. I know this is an ongoing issue but Samsung said monthly updates. If that was true then they need to bypass the carrier cause a phone that came out in Feb should have already had those updates. The moment the phone turned on and scanned for updates it should have updated. This waiting on the carrier is not needed if Samsung said monthly updates. The carriers are making it where people don't want android devices cause they have to wait for the carriers	N
Updates	Where is the update for the S22 Ultra? I read the scheduling updates and I see the S22 Ultra doesn't have any posted, I need this to make sense, I've had this device since Feb 21st and haven't seen a update yet which is kind of odd...I dont want to be a complainer but did I buy into something that has no path...maybe the by converting a note phone to a S series was a bit too much, the pre-orders were over the top meaning the ordering of more chips which is how the note got delayed...but in all Samsung is a company , so that being said when will we see this massive update that was rumored to be	N
Video Calling	I have the Samsung Ultra 22 which I feel like I should have kept my Note 20. My phone is unlocked and I cant video call. The 22 Ultra doesn't have video calling? I had this feature on my Note 20 but I don't have it with the 22 Ultra.	N

Best way of saving battery	"This is the definitive way of serious battery savings. I can attest that this works brilliantly.  
To access this, swipe down to the quick panel and press ""power saving""- not the button, but the words. Then press on ""details"" and you are presented with options.  
May I suggest 2 variants of this. The 1st option I suggest is when you're at home or work. Toggle the power saving as in my screenshot and don't turn on the last option, ""limit apps and home screen"". This will give you all your apps and services but with incredible power saving. And I don't exaggerate on that. You will easily get 13hrs plus screen on time with this if you combine with a few other power saving measures. I personally get significantly more than 13 hrs SOT using this. Again, I am not exaggerating these numbers as I've tried this myself with repeatable results.  
The 2nd option is when you're out and about and you need the battery to last the absolute maximum and you don't need all your apps on your phone. Then click on ""limit apps and home screen"". You will need to edit the bottom row of 4 apps to what apps you desire. But if you need your phone to last a very long time, this is how to do it.  
Furthermore, with this 2nd option you can make your phone last even longer if you swipe down on quick panel and turn on ""bedtime mode"" which turns the whole display to black and white. Again, this 2nd option I'm only suggesting when you're out and about, only using a few apps that you have pre loaded and absolutely prioritise battery life.  
But even that 1st option is incredibly good at extending battery life just at home and work. Try it out. If you combine these with things like dark mode on browsers and YouTube, dark wallpapers, optimised battery setting, adaptive battery on etc, you will be amazed at how long your battery will last."

Any one switch from pixel 6 pro?	"Too many issues with my p6p. I will miss the camera. Best I ever used. My s22 ultra is in the mail. Has anyone switched to the s22 ultra? Do you like better or worse?
My issues were Bluetooth, cell reception, glitchy UI and than some. Just had enough. Coming back to galaxy. Owned one since the galaxy fascinate to the s10 plus."	N
How to add custom system sounds	So I've customized my ringtone, and notification sounds, now I'm trying to changey system sounds. There are only 4 options and currently I'm trying to put the pokeball sound for whenever i plug my phone to charge, but there doesn't seem to be a way to change that. The main reason i prefer android over apple is because of how much you should be able to customize the device. Fyi this is for the samsung galaxy s22+	N
WiFi or Data... Samsung giving choice back to the people	"I always hate checking for updates at work because I don't have access to their WiFi. It's frustrating because I can see that there is an update but I'm not able to download it. So today I'm scrolling around the forum and noticed a thread talking about updates and I hadn't gotten one since I got my S22U, which we usually do get one either right out of the box or very shortly there after. So for fun I decided to check just to see if it was available. It was. Not sure why but I pushed the download button expecting I was going to get the usual, please connect to WiFi to download, but to my utter surprise it started downloading. I rubbed my eyes and checked my data status, yup still on 5G. When it finished downloading, I installed the update. All without being at home.  
Since I've owned a Samsung device I have never been able to download over data, which I never understood because; one not everyone has WiFi. I mean practically everyone does or has access to it somewhere but still not everyone. I picture people going to McDonalds or Burger King, I guess some might go to a Starbuck's but the Buckers among us would likely have WiFi so maybe not, anyway, all just to get the update for their device. Two, so many people have unlimited plans these days. It tells you how big the download is so why stop us from deciding for ourselves. It just never made sense to me and maybe you have your own take on why WiFi only was good or bad? 
Curious if anyone else has noticed this?  
I'm curious now if it's an S22 thing or have they across the board began allowing it for all devices?"	N
Samsung visual voicemail app	Anyone using the Samsung supplied VVM app? I'm a TMo US customer and have always used the TMo VVM app. Today I discovered the Samsung VVM app, which Samsung does a good job of hiding from OneUI Home screens. I discovered it while switching over/back to Nova launcher. I set it up and it seems to work well with TMo US (so far). So far it seems to be far less quirky than the TMo VVM app. Anyone else on TMo use it successfully?	N
Unlocked and 5G and 5G speeds vs. LTE	"I have an unlocked S22U and the disable 5G option is not available. It appears since I am using a Tracfone, an MVNO that runs on Verizon towers (and they are also owned by Verizon), somehow they prevent me from disabling 5G since Verizon wants you usuing 5G if available vs. LTE. 
However, downloaded a Samsung app from the Play store; ""Samsung Band Selector"" that allows me to turn off 5G and run only on LTE. 
So, for those who have a phone locked to 5G, this helps to dump it if not needed. And from the speed tests I ran today, I sure don't need it. 
Where I live, I can only get LTE; someday in my dreams (or nightmares) I may get 5G service, but not sure I want it after doing some speed tests. 
LTE speed test from my house...   
The nearest town is Driggs, they do not have 5G; so I went further south to Victor (having 5G there surprised me); however, the 5G is actually slower than my 4G LTE. (Next time I run into a big city (over 50K people) like Idaho Falls or possibly Jackson WY, I'll give 5G another shot.)   
And they want to force me to use a slower speed system? If Verizon wasn't the only provider of service where I live, I would drop Tracfone and head to a MVNO that runs T-mobile."	N
What is your vibe on the vibration motor?	"I've only had my device for about 4 days now so not a whole lot of time with the device. I have to admit that after watching so many reviews and feature videos on this device the soft vibration was one of my fears. I work in a loud environment so there is zero chance I'm going to hear the device ring so at times I rely heavily on feeling the device. Yesterday I had a silent alarm go off that was vibration only, it was a little difficult to detect. It was more than a phantom vibration so I knew it was real but it was rather faint. Today I got a call and if not for the sound I wouldn't have noticed the vibration at all.  
Currently I'm using, sync with ringtone, for calls and, zig-zig-zig, for notifications. Of course the intensity is at max for all the good that is doing. I do think the z-z-z pattern gives me the best chance for getting some sensation even if it's not very sensational. 
I don't see this as something that could be fixed with an update but that's what they said about the cameras on the S20 devices and they managed to pull off a little something to make them better. If there is anything Samsung can do to improve this I hope it is in one of the first updates because as it stands I'm not feeling the vibe."	N

I deleted the duplicate address and saved it so there's only one and immediately after saving the status changed to ""created"" and the cancel order button also disappeared.

A note on battery life	What I think a lot of people in this group are missing is what really constitutes "battery life". I see a lot of people being disappointed because their screen time is only 4 hours while totally ignoring that they got an additional 14 hours of screen off time. Obviously together this equals 18 hours of phone usage which is pretty good to me. Personally I am getting about 18 to 22 hours of Total usage on one charge with anywhere from 5 to 7 hours of screen time depending on how much I have the screen on. What I'm saying is don't use screen on time as your only measurement for battery life because your battery is still being used when the screen is off. Unless you completely drain your battery from 100% with the screen on the entire time then you're not really measuring your screen on time. If you can comfortably get through a day and not have to worry about charging your phone then I'd say it's a pretty good battery life.	N
unlocked phone with AT&amp;T- 5G, wifi calling	"I have AT&amp;T. I was reading this thread, https://forums.att.com/conversations/samsung/s22-ultra-unlocked-wifi-calling/6203f3a7eb1ebf27f6488c53?page=2
and the last person said they didn't have wifi calling? Is it because they aren't really with AT&amp;T. 
My old note 8 didn't have wifi calling because it was unlocked and had to be flashed I think. 
Do I have to get an AT&amp;T branded phone or are there no 5g or wifi calling issues with a S22 Ultra phone?"	N

Case	"I have the S21 Ultra but just upgraded to the S22 Ultra. I usually get the UAG Monarch cases for my phones but with how the camera looks on this phone from pictures I've seen (don't have it yet waiting for it to ship) I'm worried about the small coverage of the case over the camera. I work on a dock and I have the screen protector from spigen over my S21 camera and have broke those 3x being the camera sits so close to the lip of the case.

Can you all please suggest cases and a screen protector?	"I'm feeling overwhelmed by all of the S22 Ultra options. I'm not reckless but I like knowing my phone is snugly protected. I especially want something to keep the screen pristine.

S22 cases with top/bottom lip but not on the sides.	"So I just switched from an S10. I had a Spigen clear case and the sides had no lip so you could utilize the ""curved"" scree.  Now I got the belroy case and it has a lip that goes all around the edges of the screen. I kind of liked the sides being open as it was more accommodating for thumbs. 
Does anyone have good recs for minimal cases that only have lips at the top and bottom.  I might still keep the belroy for that leathery goodness but the side lip could definitely.sway my thinking.

S22 Ultra owner, Thinking of returning.. Convince me otherwise	"Hey everyone,
I currently have a S21 ultra which was a replacement for my smashed note 20 ultra. The s21U works absolutely fine but I completely love the square box style with built in spen of the notes and the new s22u.
After getting the s22u just this Friday past, I opened it, set it up and used it for awhile. To be honest the phone physically is beautiful, perfect but the performance/operation felt lack luster (only because its so damn close to the s21u).
I did not find it faster than my s21u for opening apps, browsing the web and loading. They both felt identical. I know the camera on the S22u is better which is a plus, the audio is lacking compared to the s21u.
So for the $900/1000 in trade differences to go to the s22u I'm feeling like it's just not worth it.
Im curious if anyone else is in the same boat, returned their s22u or something im missing as to why I should keep (other than the square body:)"	N

The Camera!	"I see reviews where they compare one phone against another phone.   That's cool, but I like to compare it this way...
... take a photo of something, but stay put and compare that photo to the REAL THING that you just photographed.   THAT is what is important to me:  How well does the photo catch the actual reality of that moment.
I was worried that this Samsung was going to put too much pop and sparkle in it's shots ( I hate that), but that's not the case thus far....not at all!   
I'm taking shots, then look at the image while looking at the actual scene, oh man....this thing is excellent!!!   Indoor, no flash, shots are wonderfully real.
So amazing to have this camera (that is useful as a smartphone, too))."	N

My question is, the camera specs they have look similar except S22U has way better zoom. Is there really a difference between them on the main camera without zoom ? I watched some comparison videos on YouTube and on some pics S22+ had the better looking pics which made me even more confused.

Went from S21U 12gb ram to 8gb S22U. I think I'm noticing the difference, or is it just the march update messing with me?	"What I mean by noticing the difference is things such as multitasking mainly. Jumping between apps such as Edge, to another app then going back to Edge just to have it refresh the page(not storing the app active in ram) and generally not very snappy with multitasking due to apps being closed instead of just minimized for the moment.
I'm going to contact my provider and see if I can swap. But I'm not sure if it could just be the march update which has troubled many in several different ways.
Also, no I haven't done a clean reinstall yet. The phones too new for that tbh.
I've also maxed the Ram Plus, but if any app ends up in that ""ram"", it'll be slow since the virtual memory isn't as quick.
I'm simply wondering if anyone else on the 8gb ram version (or even 12?) has noticed apps reloading when you pretty much just used it &amp; within reasonable time bringing it up again."	N
How does the S22 camera compare to the S20?	"Not sure if it's just me, but I've had a S20+ and I've never been super impressed with the camera. It does great outside with stills and good lighting, but indoors it's almost always grainy and blurry. If a subject is ever even slightly moving the photo is not good. The auto-focus is also terrible and it refuses to focus on anything that's closer than a foot to the camera.
Just curious if the S22's camera has any of these issues. Thanks!"	N

Peculiar scenario (possible shipping) placed 2/20	"Perhaps someone can assist me in my odd situation. 
Placed order on 2/20 for S22U and Tab S8U on Feb 20th. USA
S22U device changed shipping date to back to original Mar 25th.  This was initial delivery date since it was placed. Since then changed to April 6 and now back to March 25th.
The cancel button for S22U disappeared the other day.  Am still able to cancel Tab S8Ultra
When I look up order reference in FedEx, nothing shows up in terms of shipping label.
My CC has a pending charge which is no where near the amount of the S22U. More closer to the S8Ultra amount which is backordered and scheduled for delivery end of April.
Anyone else experiencing the same issue with all these ""off"" scenarios in regards to your order?

Going from S10e to S22	"One of the best purchases I've made in my life is my S10e, which I purchased exactly 3 years ago. Perfect size. Great camera. And a freaking sturdy body. God knows how many times I've dropped this, and there's no visible scratch or any cracks despite not having a screen protector. 
Of course now, 3 years on you can feel the device getting sluggish some, but it's very much useable. I was planning to upgrade only next year, but have come across a good promo where I can get the S22 256GB at roughly just under 42% of its MSRP (combination of discount codes, trading in my S10e and tax incentives) with a free silicone cover.
As such, I'm now strongly considering the S22. But once again, reviews highlight the battery life. Is it as bad as the S10e was at launch? I can't seem to find hard figures to compare the two. 
Anyone else come from the S10e to S22? How does it feel like, physically? Is it noticeably larger?   
Thanks!"	N

Good FTP client?	Hey everyone, I just traded up to an S22 Ultra after using an S8+ for years. On my S8+ I used an app called Solid Explorer for my FTP needs, which worked great, but it's giving me some trouble on my S22 Ultra. For whatever reason the phone won't actually allow me to transfer files to my internal storage with it, and yes, I have given the app full permissions to do so. I have a lot of files from my old phones I'd like to transfer to my new one, and I've tried using a USB-C but it craps out on me often and I don't know why. I really just need a good FTP client that will keep running in the background so I don't have to babysit my phone for hours, keeping it awake just so I can transfer everything.

I'm currently using Galaxy Note 9, to upgrade my phone should I wait for S23 or should I go with S22 ?	"I change my phone like every 4-5 years so when i'm changing it I want to get the max upgrades possible. Now I finally want to change my Note 9 and I'm thinking to buy an S22+, but I'm not sure about waiting for S23 or going for S22. From S21 to S22 nothing much changed, so i'm worried about S23 having huge changes/news.
Any suggestions ? What should I do ? Thank you so much!!
Edit: for people asking why i'm not going to S22 Ultra instead of S22+, because I never used the SPen on my Note 9 so I thought S22+ would be the better choice. And S22U is too expensive here."	N
Samsung brand S22+ Screen Protector	"I already have several scratches on this screen, which is interesting because my last S10+ and S21 Ultra were left with zero screen scratches. Anyways, I ordered Samsung's screen protectors. Long story short, don't waste your money. I have squatch hands, but I've never had so much trouble installing one of these and ended up wasting both of them.
The concept is nice, but the base that's included to hold the phone simply doesn't. The peel-off adhesive in the middle of screen doesn't hold, so that part kept becoming misaligned when I tried to install the top half. 
The installation process is really over-complicated for no reason. I'm sure there was some installation error involved, but I'm glad I used a 30% off code and didn't waste too much money on these."	N
Export motion photo as GIF is BAD	"Coming from the Pixel 3 XL, the S22+ camera is not great. Samsung shutter speed is slow, I cannot capture anything that moves and hope it isn't blurry. Anything that has somewhat low lighting is a mess. One of my favorite features on the pixel 3 XL was exporting motion pictures to GIFs and sending them via WhatsApp. This phone plain sucks at this task. It looks like a flip book, of maybe 5 pictures. The motion is so stuttered I don't understand the point of it being a feature. Social media maybe? 
Am I doing something wrong maybe? Anyone else with experience coming from the middle Pixel series notice this? I could rant all day about how much the camera on this phone is just not very impressive... Like why on earth do the photos self edit SO much post photo op? I want the photo I'm reviewing to look exactly how it does in the viewfinder. I have turned off most features that introduce some kind of post edit, which helped, but a lot still changes when reviewing the photos I just got took."	N
Samsung not honoring Trade-in price match	Before I sent in my trade in, I asked if they could price match the value or else I would just return my current s22 and rebuy another one with the current promotions and they told me to send in my trade in first and then they will refund me the difference. But, once my trade in processed they are telling me they cant do it. I'm just very dissapointed with Samsung and this will probably be my last purchase from them.	N

Question about upgrading from S9 Plus to S22 Plus	"Context: I own an S9 Plus 256 GB since 2018 and it has been an amazing phone. But, off-late (in its fourth year), it has started to show its age.
* The screen recently started malfunctioning - green tint and artifacts/lines throughout, and turns off when brightness is set below 40% (approx). With no other better option, I had to replace the display at Samsung authorized service center. Costed Rs. 12,000 for original screen incl. labor (approx. 160 USD). Because the display kit comes bundled with the frame as well, the only external part that was carried over was the backplate. So the phone now looks brand new. :) But I know that this issue will occur again after a few years (lots of similar stories are available on the internet). 
* Battery life has gone down - lasts till evening with mild usage (mostly phone calls and Google Maps). No confidence to step out without a charger.
I work in an IT company and Samsung has a corporate purchase program for such companies. Under this program, I am getting a good deal on S22 Plus - reduced S22 Plus price + a buyback of my S9 Plus of Rs. 19,000 (approx. 250 USD). Sweet deal.
But when I delved into the specs:
* I see that S22 has a lower resolution screen but with a faster refresh rate (120Hz). In comparison, the S9 Plus' display seemed crisper and clearer (at least for reading text).
* S9's 529 ppi vs.  S22's 393 ppi is apparent when phones are viewed closer (15-20 cm)
* While S9 Plus is jittery in scrolling and panning, S22 Plus is smooth and bright.
* S9 Plus display is curved and a pain when it comes to using cases and screen protectors (gathers dust easily and lifts off screen protector), whereas S22 is completely flat and symmetrical on all 4 sides (simply beautiful to see in person).
* In the camera department, I was not completely convinced about any real-life improvement (unless you pixel peep to see reduced noise and slightly better dynamic range in S22 Plus). 
The only reason I am interested in the purchase is the current option to sell my S9 for a better price and the 120Hz refresh rate of S22 Plus.
Question: I have to change my S9 Plus to something for sure. Given the context, do you think if I have misunderstood anything? Also, is it a sensible decision to choose S22 Plus as an upgrade to S9 Plus? Thanks for any advice!
Kindly do not suggest the S22 Ultra for its QHD screen - I do not want to spend that much on a phone."	N

Charging with original 15 watt Samsung charger	I had a question regarding charging the Samsung 22 Ultra. I still have my S10 and plan on upgrading to a S22Ultra this year sometime. I still have my original charging brick and cord for that phone and was wondering if it would charge my S22 Ultra overnight with the charger that I use for my S10. It works great and I have never had any issues with it. I have my S10 set not to fast charge at night because I never use it while I am sleeping, but have it set to fast wireless charge in case I need to to top it off during the day if the battery gets low. Do I need to buy a 25 watt charging brick for the new phone? I have read that the 45 watt charger does not offer any significant advantage and is not worth the price of buying a new one.

first time Samsung user	"As the title suggests, I'm new to samsung phones. I just received my s22 Ultra, as my LG Wing screen took a dump on me. Let me start  by saying I like it. A lot. Aside from it being slippery as a frog covered in oil. 
But the one thing I cannot wrap my head around, is the lack of s pen features. They all seem.. gimmicky. 
I feel like the one thing it could be most useful for is opening apps by hovering over them and clicking the button on it. But this seems to be a completely overlooked idea unless I'm mistaken.
Is anyone aware of any third party programs that might allow for the reprogramming of the pen for a use like this?"	N

How do I know if RCS is working on S22 Ultra?	Hey all. I have had the S22 Ultra for about a month now. I'm loving it but I have a question. I'm coming from an S20+ and was using Google Messages as my texting app. There, RCS was being used and it basically looked and functioned like iMessage on the iPhone. Now, as most of you know, Samsung has made their default texting app on their new phones Google Messages, which is great but it doesn't seem to function like it did on my S20+. The bubbles aren't that blue color and when chatting with another user (using Google Messages as well) I don't get the typing bubbles or read receipts like before. I know this has to do with RCS and when I set my phone up (S22 Ultra) I went through the set up etc. Under settings for the Messages app it says Chat Features are on. So why does it seem like it's not working like before? Any help or ideas would be greatly appreciated.	N

First impressions of 5G on the S22	"I upgraded my beloved Pixel 2 to the S22 this week and got my first taste of 5G in the Houston area. So far I have only seen Nationwide 5G and mmWave 5G (28 GHz) with some areas going back to LTE, but no C-Band found as of yet. 
It might be my imagination but the Nationwide 5G seems to be about 20% faster than what I had with LTE. I haven't done a side-by-side test.  This was surprising to me because I always thought DSS was just LTE with a 5G logo slapped on it. 
Also surprising is how much reach mmWave has in areas that have the towers. For those who are familiar with Houston, in the Uptown/Galleria area (which has terrible bumper to bumper traffic)  they have those triple Nokia cells tattooed everywhere, I have a strong 5GUW signal in the car for large blocks, even while moving and I'd have speeds of well over 1 Gigabit, in the middle of rush hour while in the car. With LTE alone and congestion, I'd be lucky to get near 10 Megabit speeds during rush hour, often less. 
Of course, as soon as I get away from that area and go back to ""poor people"" neighborhoods, it drops down to Nationwide 5G, but all the ""experts"" who make fun of mmWave 5G by saying ""you lose your signal if someone even walks in front of you ) are dead wrong about its potential. If I can have that good of a signal in a moving car,  that is a huge load off the rest of the system and helps a lot with congestion one more people have 5G capable phones.  In that area in particular there a lot of outdoor seating for restaurants, and they have street events on occasion too where the cell networks crap out typically. 
I'm keeping an eye out for C-Band later, but so far so good!  Doing my part to get rid of congestion for the rest of ya'll."	N
S22 on Verizon (5g issues)	My city does not have great coverage for 5g. There used to be a setting called "Network Mode" at Settings -&gt; Connections -&gt; Mobile Networks. That setting is now gone, so I have no way to turn off 5g and just stay on LTE, which I never had a problem on. I got 3x galaxy S22's for my family and our connections are constantly disconnecting. Where the fuck did this setting go??	N
S22 Ultra Preorder	"I ordered an S22 Ultra on announcement day.   
Locking into a 3 year contract and upgrading to 5G, with an estimated ($1\`000) for my trade in, actually made my device payment -$3 a month over the 3 year term.
I have $80 Verizon UP Dollars I can't even apply to the deal it was so good. 
The phone still hasn't arrived,  Verizon cancels my original order, resubmits it and the $400 preorder promo is now gone, and the device trade in is now $300 less.
Called and talked to a rep and they say I must sign the new purchase agreement and wait until everything is done a processed to have the original promotion reapplied. 
I work in the automotive industry, I don't sign anything I don't agree to, but apparently the only way I can get my original deal I signed up for is to sign a new deal that has wildly different terms, and take their word they will honor it after its all complete. 
This is the 2nd time I've preordered a phone, and it has been a terrible way to attempt upgrade your phone.   I can sell you a 50k car, with only 5% of the headaches these last two upgrades have cost me. 
I just don't understand why Verizon overselling their available supply means I must sign a deal that I don't' agree to, in order to fulfill my order. 
&amp;#x200B;
Anyone that can provide any insight to me ever getting this phone It would be much appreciated."	N
pixel 6 pro vs s22 ultra	I currently have a note 20 ultra. And I seem to be one of the lucky ones that has network issues with it. I'm thinking of paying this off and upgrading. I wanted to wait until the pixel 7 came out but not sure I can deal with this issue another 5 months. So I'm curious as to honest reviews from people that have used these devices for awhile. If you use either what do you like and not like any either the s22 ultra or the pixel 6 pro. I've heard the pixel 6 has had a rough start has it been improved with updates? I've also read the s22 suffers from network issues as well	N
Unlocked S22 Ultra not getting 5G	I live in a city where 5G is everywhere (and the coverage map indicates that), yet my SIM card seems to only be provisioned for 4G LTE. I have tried the ENHANCEDPHONE apn, but to no avail. What gives AT&amp;T?? I know my phone is plenty capable of 5G as it works on Verizon.	N

S22U on dual sim	"So i put my personal on business on my S22U, seems nice for the most part. MAKING call you get an option what sim you want to call from,data i get 5GUC on which sim i choose for primary,which works fine. The one thing i noticed when i send a photo from (non primary sim) you get a msg please change from tmobile to tmobile(i know using the same service)
I finally figured out how to change it in (sim card manager) then fr primary to other sim,then back to the msg (google msg) and send pictures.. also there is no way to have tmobile vm on both account, one uses the vvm and the other sim uses old fashion voice which only comes up when someone leaves a msg. Which sucks."	N

Going from S10e to S22	"One of the best purchases I've made in my life is my S10e, which I purchased exactly 3 years ago. Perfect size. Great camera. And a freaking sturdy body. God knows how many times I've dropped this, and there's no visible scratch or any cracks despite not having a screen protector.
Of course now, 3 years on you can feel the device getting sluggish some, but it's very much useable. I was planning to upgrade only next year, but have come across a good promo where I can get the S22 256GB at roughly just under 42% of its MSRP (combination of discount codes, trading in my S10e and tax incentives) with a free silicone cover.
As such, I'm now strongly considering the S22. But once again, reviews highlight the battery life. Is it as bad as the S10e was at launch? I can't seem to find hard figures to compare the two.
Anyone else come from the S10e to S22? How does it feel like, physically? Is it noticeably larger?
Thanks!
EDIT: I have the Exynos S10e and this time round we're getting the Snapdragon S22. It's always been the Exynos variant in our market till now. "	N

Second Factory Data Reset S22U	"Just performed my 2nd factory data reset on my less than 1 week old S22U. First time it was due to 'camera failed' when launching the front facing camera.

HDR Issue on S22 Ultra (Snapdragon)	"I have posted yesterday regarding on the HDR problems on the S22 Ultra, the issue being the screen dimming after moving the brightness slider to increase brightness. Some have spectucalated it may be due to the Vision Booster Samsung had bragged about. If so, I would like to know how to disable Vision Booster and publish a software update to fix the issue?
Please upvote this to gain more attention and for Samsung themselves to acknowledge this issue  to fix this issue ASAP. One of the main features of this phone is for maximum viewing pleasure but how can I enjoy when the brightness is so dark and there is nothing I can do to increase the brightness?

Upgrading from S10e: thinking of S22, how does battery life compare?	"I'm coming from the S10e, being interested in a smaller sized smartphone. Since it is 3 years, the battery and performance have degraded a little bit so I am thinking of upgrading.
I'd like Samsung as I also have a Galaxy Watch. Considering my preference for form factor the S22 seems best. How does its battery life compare to the s10e? I know it is a 3100mAh vs 3700mAh but I'm hearing bad things about the S22's battery life."	N

UK: S22 ultra screen protector suggestions	"Anyone found a decent screen protector for the s22 ultra in the UK?
I've tried 3 so far, each with their own problems, all from amazon. 
Spigen: black bordered screen protector which doesn't even cover the whole screen.
Tech21: same problem as spigen. 
Uniqueme: no black borders, probably the best one out of the 3 except it has 2 faint lines in the middle. Makes it look like my screen is damaged (gave me a heart attack) but I've tried the 2 that came with it, and taken 1 off with the 2 lines still there. 
These 3 are fairly reputable screen protector providers so was very disappointed when none of them were any good, considering I've used them for other devices without any complaints."	N

S21FE, S21+ or S22+?	"Hey guys, Im upgrading from a S9+ and just wanted to get a quick opinion on which phone to get. Here in Singapore, the S21FE costs around $900, S21+ at $1200 and S22+ at $1570 (includes $200 samsung e-voucher), all for the 256gb model. I am considering the plus models for the better battery and also the similar size to my current S9+ (felt that the s22 is too small for my liking). 
Right now im leaning towards the S22+ due to the better camera quality but am still skeptical if its really worth the price difference. Would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions esp those who are currently using these phones. Thanks in advance!"	N
should I upgrade from an S21 to an S22?	I honestly don't see many differences this year. I usually do the upgrade program, but I'm wondering if it's actually worth it this year. Unless I'm looking at it wrong, the only upgrade is a subtle change to the camera?	N

Samsung Galaxy Smartphone Functionality Enhancement suggestion	Developer Suggestion for S22 Ultra:Please make it so that we the consumers do not have to physically tap with our finger (or stylus) , in every web browser, address bar, default system search bar, app search bar, and/ortext box before they will become active and ready to recieve our commands to search or text.Example: **And this is not limited to the S22 Ultra, but for simplicity I'll use the S22 Ultra as an example ...When I swipe up from the home screen of the S22 Ultra, presuming I haven't altered or customized my default settings, the app tray will be displayed. At the top of this screen there's a search bar which gives the ability to search for apps, files, basically my entire phone but before I can enter a search command in this search bar, I must take my finger and physically tap into the search bar BEFORE it's active. Once i do tap in that search bar, my keyboard pops up allowing me to type in my search. This function should be automated. I shouldn't have to take my finger or stylus and tap the search because this is the verything I'm intending to do when I access this particular screen.This is my first suggestion so are we notified if and when suggestions are implemented or at least reviewed?

Galaxy S22 Ultra	So, I'm curious if anyone has or had the galaxy S22 ultra, is there anything that's a huge let down to it?

I know the S22 had some major faults upon its release, but I've waited a few months to see what others think since then. If anyone could gimme their opinion or pros and cons, thatd be fantastic. Just a curiosity. I've seen so many reviews and watched so many YouTube videos. But could use some real legitimate thoughts.	N

The default Google messages app on Galaxy s22 removed a lot of cool features	Using the new default Google messages on my new s22 ultra isn't as good as it was on my previous Galaxy note 20 ultra. I'm not a big fan of the new Samsung'like skin for the default Google messages app on the s22 lineup because It leaves a huge space at the top that says "messages" .ore like how Samsung messages are and it takes away the Google messaging experience. I'd much rather prefer the original google skin I had on my note 20 ultra with the search bar at the top and next to the search bar to the right top is my Google profile photo. It just feels like Samsung is forcing us to like the new design without being able to change it.Also certain features have been lost that I had on my Google messages app on my old note 20 ultra:1. iphone emoji reactions are gone2. No update has taken place to use the new message category organizer on the Google messages appThe app feels plain now and I hope they can fix this and go back to the original design of the app and being back Google's new messages RCS features.

I checked all the permissions and location is set right I even compared this too my NOte20U. I was thinking maybe its because I disabled some bloat but then why would it work sometimes?

Has anyone tried Turning off Adaptive Battery and putting unused apps to sleep off resulting to a better SOT/idle battery drain?	"Just a quick question, has anyone tested if turning the adaptive battery off and putting unused apps to sleep off improves your SOT and idle battery drain? I have read this post https://redd.it/p2j30u and it says it improves the performance of the battery. 
1 comment from that post explains why having adaptive battery on consumes more battery: 
""Issue is OEMs (in this case Samsung) are allowed to modify those algorithms to be more aggressive. Samsung tuned something wrong and it's over aggressive which leads to some core Android services being blocked from triggering. OS scheduler then tries to do same thing over and over again and because it fails, it keeps itself in endless loop. It's wasting CPU cycles and battery. Remember that Android System has wakelocks. Those wakelocks are here because system tries something, Samsung algorithm blocks it, than system tries again and again...""

Pardon me for comparing it with iOS. I recently switched from iPhone, is this something that isn't available on Android or is there actually a way to get this done?"	N

Is Samsung punishing its customers? (S22 Ultra CPUs discusson)	"I  was quite excited about the new release of the S22 Ultra because I'm ready to upgrade my Oneplus6 after 4 years. As I don't want to buy a  Chinese phone or an Apple-branded one there isn't much of a choice but to buy Samsung if you want a high-end smartphone, but every year there is a headache - two different chips on the same phone. Nobody would care if performance was the same but it's not, and in 2022 it's not great in both camps be it Exynos or Snapdragon.
Snapdragon version:
* Multiple reviews show the chip overheats in intense usages, like gaming and dropping performance.
* Increased battery usage after the latest update (March).
Exynos version:
* Worse  image processing for video and photos in multiple reviews (seriously  what the hell?? Kinda big deal because the camera is one of the main  selling points of S22Ultra)
* Worse  battery performance in the first-month reviews and better performance  than snapdragon recently (what's happening here? Did snapdragon get a  bad update or did Exynos get fixed? Maybe both, nobody knows.)
* Insane  lags on a brand new device (Seen quite a bit of angry reviews in my  local area phone stores about that, multiple people just returned their  phones I guess)
* Worse peak performance than snapdragon but a higher sustained performance over time
Just a few points stated above, not gonna talk about buggy UI because that's expected from a brand new device, but the difference because of a chip is just insane. One month battery suck on one version next month it's vice versa, just terrible.
All in all, trying to figure out which version of a device to get is a  headache, to say the least. And neither looks great, to be honest. Also as a European, I'm kinda forced to buy an inferior chip - Exynos, so why is Samsung punishing its customers? And what do you guys think? Feel free to discuss this in the comments.
Adding a few links to reviews I've watched comparing devices:

Google Carrier Service	"So I as far as I knew I thought Samsung phones didn't use the Google Carrier Services app.  My Locked ATT S22 Ultra has it and I only have the option to disable it.  
I switched to the Ultra from the Pixel 6 and I know  my old apps transferred over to this phone.  Is it possible that this is what happened and I can't delete it or are Samsung phones now using this?
Thanks 👍"	N
help: supcase unicorn beetle pro sucks	"I recently got one and it feels great (though a small patch of rubber below the buttons on the right side is not firm and can be squeezed a little bit), and I am facing a major issue with it. It's not compatible with screen protectors.
I tried whitestone dome and it got lifted up and cracked in 3 corners the first time. The second, I tried to be really careful in centering the protector but it still got lifted up in the upper two corners and cracked as soon as I put the case on. Reading recent reviews, other people are also facing the same problem. 
Fortunately, whitestone refunded me my money in a day (had heard horror stories about them but they were great!). Now, I have a few choices:
1) return the beetle pro and get another case (OtterBox or monarch?) which is compatible with whitestone/amfilm screen protectors
2) try another screen protector such as zagg and see if it works on the beetle pro (dunno if this will work)
3) go bare with the beetle pro and get Samsung care
What would you recommend?
Tldr: beetle pro is not compatible with screen protectors so what should I do now"	N
FYI: Charging Speed Fix	"Idk if this has been posted before but FYI if you've been having charging speed issues or found the 45watt brick (if you got it) is slow, check to see if your cable (and charger if you use 3rd party) supports PPS or PD charging standards. It seems that Samsung has made Quick Charge 3 a bit slower this generation, so if your cable/charger doesn't support PPS/PD you will NOT be pulling 45 watts. 
Tldr: you need a PPS/PD charger/cable combo."	N

Looking for honest opinions	"I've got a green s22 ultra on order due early next month but I'm starting to think of canceling it. 
I have a note 10+ that honestly works great, I have zero issues with it. Plus it has an SD card that I use for audiobooks. I don't care about 5g and hardly take pictures. 
I'm hearing reports that the s22 ultra gets hot doing normal tasks and I'll be the first to admit I'm not a fan of hot phones. I still remember my old s3 and I never want that again. 
But I don't know what to believe, either it's super negative or super positive, so I'm looking for help while I still have time to cancel my order. 
Any note 10+ users in particular regret their purchase? Or are really pleased?"	N

Low light/ moving subject fixes	"I am upgrading to the S22u (If it ever arrives) from the note 10plus.

The note10 is very blurry if the subject so much as slightly turns their head in anything thats not outdoor light. 
The reviews all seem to suggest that the camera is great, but I do keep reading that the blur might still be an issue with the s22u. People who actually have their phones, are you finding this an issue? Is there a work around? RAW mode? Gcam? (Is gcam still a thing?) 
I don't mind not fully utilizing the cameras capabilities if I can get a non blurry show of my kid learning to crawl.

Let's talk about the switch from iPhone to S22U	"Through the years I've used both Samsung and iPhone.
I have almost always mainly used iPhone since the 4 with the exception of using a couple note devices, the s5 and s8.
That said I currently have an iPhone 13PM and Saturday added an S22U. I'm on the fence on whether I will keep my S22U and it makes me a little sad thinking about returning it because it is a great phone. I just want to touch on some things that I thought were going to be great and have ended up not being what I hoped.
I AM NOT A TECH PERSON. This is for the Snapdragon version as I am in the US.
The Pros:
* ***The overall phone is much more comfortable to hold. I don't have to have a pop socket on the device like my iPhone. My iPhone is bulkier and does hurt my wrist with long viewing times.***
* ***Scrolling on the s22u is extremely nice and the screen quality is so stunning.***
* ***Typing on the s22u is nice with the haptic feedback***
* ***Jumping through apps is seamless.***
* ***Extremely fast charging and usb-c***
* ***Fingerprint scanner is cool (once you get used to it.)***
* ***The s-pen is really freaking cool, and I always loved that feature on my notes.***
* ***I like the ability to go back a page on either side of the screen***
* ***It feels or seems (to me) that the phone service is better quality on the s22u. I don't use 5g currently and 4g LTE is smoother on the s22u vs the 13pm.***
* ***The GW4 is so nice and I have enjoyed my experience with it.***
* ***Samsung's ear buds connect faster than my air pods. They also hurt my ears less.***
* ***Being able to buy kindle books in the actual Kindle app is incredible.***
* ***Customizability. Incredible.***
* ***Syncing between one-drive from my PC to the s22u is seamless.***
&amp;#x200B;
Now, the cons:
* ***The battery. I've been using both phones the same amount and as of right now the s22u is sitting at 46% and my iPhone is at 86%. The s22u is not at max settings and is optimized app wise so the ones I'm not using are in deep sleep or shut off (whatever it's called)***
* ***The camera. This is a big con for me and what is making me the most tempted to return it. I'm a photographer and have been for a few years, iPhones photos have always been great, and their colors are amazing. When watching videos on YouTube about the s22u they made the photos seem like they were the best and the quality LOOKED so freakin CRISP. I have kids, I love to capture moments with them and of them, but they also move around like fish out of water 95% of the time. These photos are BLURRY. Not only are they blurry, but they're also washed out, the contrast is poor, and the photos are PIXELY. I have attempted to capture images in all ways on the phone, pro mode, portrait, regular and the quality feels like I've stepped back into the 2010's era. Maybe it's user error but this is a huge con to me personally since I do use my phone camera OFTEN. I've tested it in every lighting scenario, and it just doesn't hold up.***
* ***The emojis. Man are they ugly. This is purely aesthetic but is a con for me.***
* ***Sometimes it does feel like the phone is a little warm when I am holding it in my hands and scrolling for long periods of time, but I have a case on it so I'm not sure if it's hot cause of the system or because of me holding it. Either way, it gets warm sometimes.***
* ***I did feel like I was getting headaches by the end of the day being on it, especially at night. I wish it could go a little darker because in my pitch-black room it still felt a little too bright.***
* ***Some apps are more fluid on IOS.***

I really do enjoy the S22U, the experience on this phone is incredible and is a real competitor to iPhones (for those of us who are strictly iPhone, please don't come for me, I just mean in this sense, because IOS is such a closed system, but iPhone users seem to be tempted to switch with this series. Again, don't come for me!). I just feel lied to by YouTube saying how amazing and insane the cameras are on this phone and boy is it not. It's very lackluster at best. Overall, I do enjoy the phone and I really cannot decide if I want to keep it or send it back. It's been a long time since I've felt this way about Samsung against iPhone since I've been exclusively with iPhone since about 2016 so it's a tough decision."	N
S22 ultra Red 512gb (feb 9th ordered) updated to preparing dispatch	finally (Canada)	N
Trying to decide between a Fold and an S22 Ultra	I'll start off by saying if the Fold has the crease or any sort of screen ripple whatsoever I don't want it, but I do think the folding is cool. The S pen I don't really care about, but for hardware it looks like the S22 is better too. Is there any reason to get a Fold over the S22 Ultra?	N
Has ANYONE who ordered a S22U exclusive colour in Canada received a tracking number or their phone?	"Ordered sky blue on Feb 9, 256GB in Canada. I know these posts are annoying for some but at this point it's getting ridiculous. 
Status is processing and it's been 'on the way' for almost 2 weeks.
There has been absolutely no communication from Samsung. The last email I got from them was on Feb 25 welcoming me to my new Galaxy phone, which I didnt have then and still don't have.
No delay emails like the US got.
I sit in queue to talk to customer service with a wait time of 3-5 hours with 300+ people in front of me to get empty promises and lies from customer service.
I got charged the day after I ordered and got absolutely no add ons either than the memory upgrade.
Its frustrating to see people from other parts of the world get their exclusive colours before us from Canada even though they ordered after us PLUS free items or discounted items too.
I've been patient up until now, I've refrained from constantly talking to customer service everyday, I haven't said anything on this subreddit or anywhere else, but at this point I paid almost 2k for a phone and I've gotten nothing but silence.
But don't worry guys, customer service told me it'll come next week for sure!!!
Update: order now says preparing dispatch and  on the way. I'm guessing itll be another 3 weeks until its sent 🙂👍"	N

Is the back cover on the S22U more frail than previous versions?	When I first got my S22U I was excited that they finally did away with the glass back because I always tended to break them. I'm a month into using my S22U and today I noticed a hairline crack on the back across the top. Is this material even weaker than glass? I'm starting to think this is intentional.	N
$100 Google play credit for s22u is false advertisement.	$100 Google play credit for s22u is false advertisement. goog luck even getting samsungs support to help you 🤣 they'll just tell you to please wait 24 to 48 hrs. then 48 hrs later tell you the same thing again. rinse repeat. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 wonder what apple will give for trade in?	N
S21+ vs S22+ ?	"After rocking my S9+ for the past 4 years, I've decided it's finally time for an upgrade. The two main models I am looking at are the S21+ and the S22+, and right now I am leaning towards the 21+ I think. I don't take many pictures so the camera upgrade on the 22+ doesn't really matter to me. The main things I'm concerned about are display, processing speeds, and battery life.  I have also looked at the ultra models for that juicy battery life, but as someone who likes big phones, I found them to be a bit too big to be comfortable using one-handed. 
For someone like me, is the really any reason to pony up the extra $ for the 22+?"	N
Preorder	Still haven't gotten a email for preorder credit	N

Galaxy s22 ultra exclusive color delays	So I pre-ordered my new S22 Ultra 516GB blue February 10th and still not recieved it! No updates what so ever and the only email that I am receiving is a automated email said "yout phone is still delayed and we will send you another email with a new shipping date". I was suppose to receive it March 10th and I contacted Samsung so many **bleep** times but the only thing that they say "oh cause you ordered the Samsung exclusive color" but who gives a **bleep**, I pre-ordered it so the regular and the exclusive colors should be made at the same time. The only thing that the say is "when S22 gets sent out we will send you 50$ for the problem it caused". 1st off 50$ isn't even enough for all the problems that this order is causing me and not to mention they do not even know when my phone will be shipped so its a **bleep** mystery. What is the point of the pre-order when myself and so many others isn't even getting their phone yet and seems like we have a lot more waiting to do. Bad business and bad customer service at its finest. 	N
SAVED $342.43 AFTER I cancelled my first order!	I noticed last year when I placed my order for my S21 Ultra that Samsung simply plays with the numbers to suck you in and make it LOOK like they're giving loyalty discounts while they're actually GETTING MORE OUT OF CONSUMERS POCKETS.One is forced to use a "$200" credit on SAMSUNG'S Add-ons...which you're have to use at the time of purchase. If you choose not to use it YOU LOSE IT. If you choose to use it they're banking on you buying ADDITIONAL ACCESSORIES in excess of their "$200 CREDIT". Like a watchband, an extra case, charger, you name it. Whatever you choose it NEVER ADDS UP TO $200. You'll ALWAYS SPEND MORE THAN THE $200 CREDIT AMOUNT.People think of Samsung as a SNEAKY USED CAR DEALER. They're fudge around with the numbers to make it LOOK LIKE YOU'RE GETTING THOSE PROMISED DISCOUNTS WHEN YOU NEVER RECEIVE ANYTHING IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM. PERIOD. I too ordered during the live release on Feb. 9th, my birthday. I ordered the Unlocked 512GB Graphite device. I kept track of the progress of my order and the shipping dates of the various storage sizes and noticed the Unlocked 512GB Phantom Black device was shipping faster at the time than the "web exclusive" Graphite.I cancelled my order in hope of getting a device faster. I did several mock-ups of different variations of orders before finally placing an order for my final choice. What I realized is that if you're PATIENT and wait 3-4 WEEKS you'll get the same device for literally hundreds of dollars less than you would've spent if you placed an order on the day of it's release.I checked the trade-in value of my wife's S20 I noticed Samsung had increased the value of an S20 trade-in by $175.I placed a new order on 3/1 for the said Unlocked 512GB in Phantom Black through Rakuten and saved $317.43 and wasn't stuck using the "$200 credit" on a Galaxy 4 Classic I didn't want in the first place. The TOTAL SAVINGS came to $317.43 WITHOUT THE SMARTWATCH BUT INCLUDING A $100 CREDIT to the Play Store from Samsung themselves PLUS $25 from Rakuten who will send me a physical check.So I ended up saving a total of $342.43 from the order I placed on 2/9. The only downside being the delivery date. I originally was due to receive my order on 3/25 but today I received an email stating the new delivery date had been pushed back to 4/12 due to "unusually high demand".I'd much rather save $342.43 cuz these devices depreciate faster than a speeding bullet.	N
Went to TMobile Store for S22 Ultra, Note22	I wanted to see if it was worth an upgrade. They seem to think there will be a Note22 in the fall. I mainly wanted to put my hands on it. Smaller than Note20. No difference in experience or display. They had a serious lock on it so you couldn't pick it up, or flip it over. Feel the weight of it, nothing. I wouldn't buy a phone I couldn't completely check out before purchasing. I've bought more expensive jewelry I could at least check out.	N
Pre-Order	Has anyone actually received their pre-order for the regular S22? I did order one of the exclusive colors, but at the time it stated that I would receive my order by March 8th. The case and Galaxy Buds2 I ordered are also delayed even though the buds are in stock on the Samsung website.	N
Changed password and now I have to hit OK	I had to change my password when my screen had to be replaced and now I have to hit OK after entering pin. The option not to no longer shows up.

65w Charger for S22 Ultra?	So I know the S22 Ultra says it can handle up to 45w charging....But in the past I've timed the 45w charger with my Note 10plus & Note 20 ultra... They charged way faster than my 15w or 25w... On average (15-20 mins faster).I'm assuming it will be the same with the S22 Ultra if I buy the 65w charger? My phone already charges really fast with rh 45w... But like everything, if it possible for me to have it faster of course I'm gonna get it.Would appreciate any advice🙏	N
Older google widget	Google search bar from s8 transferred to my s22 ultra. I can't remove this widget. Long press does not work. It's the older search bar	N
Lock Screen/Home Screen Wallpaper	I keep setting my own home and lock screen wallpapers and every night my Galaxy S22 ultra randomly changes them. I have turned off dynamic lock screen. I have changed settings so that wallpaper is not allowed to make changes to my device. This is my 5th Galaxy device. However, nothing seems to fix this issue.	N
How to join One UI beta	How do I join the beta program? I don't see the banner at all	N
Keyboard customization	There is not a single keyboard app for the galaxy s22 ultra where I can customize the space bar row - this is ridiculous. It should be very simple to resize the buttons on the keyboard in preferences in order to avoid fat fingers hitting unwanted keys. The enter button is double the the size it needs to be, and the symbols key could be 1/3 the size. The Spacebar should take up the majority of the bottom row to assist it faster typing.	N
"Monthly" Security Patches	It seems like we don't actually get monthly security patches? Or is there a lot more to it that I don't see at a glance? It says there are monthly provided security updates for the listed phones here:https://security.samsungmobile.com/workScope.smsbI got an unlocked phone because I heard carriers will delay patches that manufacturers release and I've had the Jan 1 2022 Security patch update since I got the phone late February and most of March so far, even though I check once a day for updates.It seemed like the same amount of HIGH and CRITICAL vulnerabilities were posted each month of December, January, February.Are the monthly updates not about the security patch date, but something else?	N
S22 Ultra order s is a headache	I initially pre-ordered my s22 ultra on day one and it arrived on release day. However, after 1 week of using it the screen had a dead pixel. I already had sent in my trade in device which made things much worse. I called Samsung and told them the issue and they suggested that I send the phone back with all the extra stuff I got with it using the $250 promo credit. They told me they will price match everything and when I get my new phone and accessories the total price will be the same. That was fine with me but they did say the expected delivery date for the new one will be April 1st. which was about 3-4 weeks out. I had no choice but to go ahead and order it. In the meantime I'm borrowing a phone from a friend to use until my new order arrives. This is where things get frustrating. I get an email last Monday stating that my phone is being delivered earlier than expected on March 29th. which hey I'm cool with. the earlier the better. However, I check my order status on the Samsung app and it still shows April 1st and checking the order status on the web shows it got pushed back to April 19th now. I finally get an email yesterday that My order is pushed back until April 19th. So now I'm beyond **bleep** because I already sent my trade in device and borrowing someone's phone that needs his phone back. Called Samsung team and all they did was put me on hold and hang up the call. Now I'm like **bleep** do I do, I cant cancel the order because they already have my trade in device. I'm someone who buys the new model every year so what's the point if you have to wait 2-3 months to get it when the newer model will be released a year later. SAMSUNG you guys dropped the ball with this launch.	N
Canceled order	Got email saying that it would be April 19 before s22U would ship. Just forget it. Ordered a Note 20 Ultra, mint. Too many rumors of problems anyway. I would have got a Note 10+ 5g if I could have found one in mint condition. I'll check the 22 out someday. 😉	N
Data Migration to new phone questions	"My S22 Ultra arrives tomorrow, upgrading from a Note 10+ so I hope to be pleasantly surprised. 
Last few notes I have used the Sammy tool to migrate my data over, I know that when you log in with your Google account it will try to install all the apps you had before. 
QUESTIONS:  Can I pick a choose which apps get installed?I have my pictures from my 5 previous Notes spread all over the place. Any ideas how to consolidate?Is it better to use the Sammy tool or go totally clean and manually install the apps you really use? 
Thanks in advance"	N

Are there any cons to RAM plus?	"Hi all. I'm not understanding RAM plus. Apparently, you can increase the phone's RAM by taking some of the hard drive shortage and allocating that to RAM.

When, and how often should I charge my phone, to keep the battery healthy?	"On my previous iphone I charged overnight and it seemed to have degraded the battery health to 83% in just one year of use. 
My phone is only 4 days old now, so I think the battery is draining a bit faster than it should. I have reset the phone once to skip the smart switch process. 
I charge it when it gets to 50 or below and remove it before it goes above 90-95. But I've had to charge it twice a day so far.
This is my first time getting such an expensive phone. I would love to hear your tips on decreasing the battery drain and keeping it healthier for longer.
Things I do now: keep 5g off. Display set to fhd+. Kept 13 apps including most social media apps in deep sleep mode. Got an original 45w adapter from samsung. Only charged to 100% once now.

I would think that Samsung could do that too. Instead, I have to print out the label and cover it with packing tape to make sure it doesn't smudge. And then find bubble wrap to secure the phone in the box."	N

Case: torn and would love input	"My wife and I both have our phones on the way and need to pick out cases.  So far we have it narrowed down to these as options (will be used with whitstone screen protector).
UAG Kevlar $80
Tough Armor $20
Torras Marsclimber $23
Otterbox Commuter $32
I've used a rough armor on my s9+ for 4 years and it has done very well and survived many drops so I have a feeling it would still he good on the ultra but worry about it not being grippy enough for a larger device.
The UAG is obviously the most protective but lacks a kickstand and of course is expensive. I could always keep a phone holder on my desk if needed though. 
The Marsclimber looks really nice but worry because some have said its a bit slippery. Seems protective enough but not as much as the rest. 
The otterbox is a big contender for my wife especially since it comes in purple.  It seems quite protective but worry about it being slippery as well.

New GoS mode allows higher temps before throttling	"So, with the new update for March, I noticed a couple things with the changes they added for GoS (Game Booster Settings -&gt; Labs -&gt; Alternate game performance management).
Using Perf Z from Samsung's Game Plugins, I monitored the FPS and chipset heat.
Games I tested on: Blue Archive, Punishing Gray Raven, Alchemy Stars, Arknights
GoS default: Throttled around 42c-43c and FPS will drop below 60 until the device is cool enough.
GoS Alt: Chipset temperatures hit 45c and there was no throttling still. I'm guessing the limit is raised at least a few Celsius.
The phone didn't noticeably get hotter faster for the games I tested on either but none of these games have had FPS issues on max settings. The increased temperature range is a nice one though for longer gaming sessions. I also did these tests jumping from one game to another at temps for 41-45c after saturating the cooling capacity.
This update also took my Geekbench 5 scores higher.
Single: 1245
Multi: 3586
Overall, pretty nice update and it doesn't seem to impact my battery life that much more unless I'm gaming. I think my games pull the same amount of power but the throttle limit was raised allowing for longer game sessions."	N

Does the battery usage show everything? I calculated the battery usage and it totalled 44.4% which means I should be left with 55.6% battery life. But I'm only left with 35%		N

Results of tracking my Base S22 Exynos' battery stats for almost 3 weeks	"I got my Base S22, Exynos delivered on March 3rd, and I have been tracking my battery stats for almost 3 weeks due to getting poor battery life on my device. I was mainly interested in figuring out how to maximize my SOT and how to minimize my overnight battery drain, and here's a graphical summary of what I found:
* [Active, idle, and total usage since March 5](https://imgur.com/qybEeNa)
* [Overnight battery drain since March 6](https://imgur.com/fUAlsxk)
* [Extrapolation of 100% battery usage for full SOT prediction](https://imgur.com/hjou3iU)
I'll go into more details below, but the main findings are:
1. My phone's average active SOT is 2:25h, with the best being 3:15h and my worst being 1:48h. Edit: Extrapolating all my active SOT to 100% of battery usage data results in an estimated 3:15h of active SOT.
2. Prior to the March update, my phone's overnight idle drain used to be around 4%/h on WiFi but around 1%/h on 4G. After the March update, overnight idle drain for WiFi improved to around 2%/h, but 4G idle drain was mostly unaffected.
3. There is a software-level bug where the system does not enter deep sleep when the WiFi module is on
And most importantly, the two most impactful actionable steps for my battery life were:
1. Running Galaxy App Booster after a software update
2. Turning off WiFi and 5G
&gt; Running Galaxy App Booster after a software update
I don't know if it was the March software update or the Galaxy App Booster than helped, but I did both and saw a massive change in my idle drain with WiFi after doing both. 
&gt; Turning off WiFi and 5G
This halves my idle drain, as I get around 2%/hour battery drain on either WiFi or 5G, but around 1%/hour on 4G. For reference, idle drain on airplane mode was around 0.4%/hour.
Below are some important configurations of my phone throughout my experiment:
* Phone setup from scratch with no SmartSwitch
* Charge level capped to 85% from protect battery setting^1
* Adaptive battery: On^2
* Processing speed: Optimized
* Adaptive power saving: On
* Super fast charging: On (Using official 25W charger)
* Fast wireless charging: On (Using official Samsung duo wireless charger)
* Dark mode: On
* Adaptive brightness: On
* Motion smoothness: Adaptive
* Eye comfort shield: Sunset to sunrise
* Screen mode: Vivid
* Bluetooth: On
* NFC: Off
* Location: Off
* VoLTE: On
* Wi-Fi Calling: On
* Wi-Fi power saving mode: On
*1) I experimented with charging it to 100% twice to see what SOT would be like from a full charge. On 4G, I got to 2:32 active and 21:46 idle until I hit 19%. On 5G, I got to 2:33 active and 10:17 idle until I hit 14%.*
*2) I experimented with turning adaptive battery off since I read some posts that it helps battery life, but I didn't see any benefits.*
Below are my actual data:

I've tried playing around with various settings, but I haven't been able to find a configuration that wouldn't dumb down the features of my phone I care about (ex: turning off 120hz) while enabling me to consistently squeeze out 4h+ of active SOT. The things I could do that I haven't done yet are:
1. ~~Further de-bloat the device with adb~~ *Done Mar 22*
2. ~~Wipe cache partition~~ *Done Mar 22*
3. Factory reset the device
4. Get my device exchanged for a new one
It seems that I am not alone with seeing poor battery life on my S22 ([similar post on Samsung community](https://us.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-S22/S22-line-of-phones-Battery-Drain/m-p/2204568#M9578)), but I also see screenshots here of people getting 5 to 7 hours of active SOT on their base S22. 
What has been your experience so far, and what has worked best for improving battery life on your device?

Upgraded from Iphone, but the S22 camera is ???	"Hi! Finally upgraded from my IPhone 8 to a Galaxy S22 (yay)  
Very slick.. but I'm having a major issue with it, and it's the big reason I upgraded to begin with.  
I'm a traditional media artist (illustration on paper) and would take pictures of my art using my old phone, with little issue.  
The S22 however, insists on focusing onto certain parts and blurring out other spots of my drawings. It's driving me absolutely batty and I'm beginning to regret my purchase lol  
So for example, I photograph a drawing of a character, and my options are either a crisp head and blurred out muddy body or visa versa. The blur is just so strong.  
I've tried fiddling around with the camera settings, but I'm a stupid newbie and there are so many options.  
I've tried turning on/off ""scan documents"" and ""Scene optimizer""  
""Shot suggestions"" is off  
I've toyed with the numerous picture ratios? (don't know the proper name, but ""Full"" 1:1 9:16 etc)  
Been trying to look through possible apps, but not having luck or the directions are too obtuse for me.  
Any help is so very very much appreciated! Truly. App suggestions, or if it's possible to change the original camera settings to what I need?

All previous android phones I've had will stop one and let let new one play. This pretty annoying especially when I'm in the car listening to music and a call comes in and now both are  still playing. Anyone find a way to stop this?"	N

I chatted with support in the past and they said when I get a tracking number chat back and they will direct it for me. 
So I chatted today and was told they cannot direct the shipment anywhere. I would have to drive up there, wait for it or have it held for a pickup at theat depot.  Ok not the best but maybe.

General Camera Question..	"Hi all. Just recieved my S22 Ultra upgrading from the S20+. One of the big factors in upgrading was for the camera. 
That being said, which camera do I use? The 108 MP camera or the standard 3:4 (12 MP I assume? camera). Obviously both are loads better from my previous phone and I notice it with both options but what should I consider when choosing between the two?
It's my understanding that the 108 MP camera is just a high resolution standard photo where the 12 MP 3:4 uses a lot of pre/post processing to create a better photo from the camera. 
Any help or explanation would be welcomed!

Samsung Galaxy Watch 4| S22 Ultra| Battery Life| GBOARD| India	"Got my S22 Ultra and Galaxy Watch 4 bundle here in India on the 9th of March. Been using both of them paired together ever since. I've gotta say, i was expecting the battery life of the S22 Ultra to take a hit because of the bluetooth and internet connection sharing but damn! 6hrs+ screen on time with 30mins of gaming and rest just browsing the web and Youtube. To clarify, im on WQHD+ and 120Hz and Wifi and 4G, 50% brightness. Im really impressed by the Galaxy Watch 4's battery life too. Gotta say, based on the other posts regarding the GOW4's battery saying the battery life was terrible, i was really happy with what i was getting. Ending the day consistently with 50% battery left with AOD off and around 37% with AOD Off. My usage is moderately heavy. LOTS of notification checking and replying. Music control. 1 hour workout tracking. I've even installed the latest March 2022 update and found no difference in battery life since so many of you guys said that the new update kills battery life.
The thing is, I found the Samsung T9 keyboard to be a little cumbersome to use when i'm in a hurry. Downloaded Gboard since and just love it!! The Swipe gestures are just a life saver. 
But ever since i've installed Gboard, the battery life of the watch seemed to have been hit hard. I'm ending days with hardly 20% left. Sometimes evening dropping to 15%. I would say that i find this acceptable since i charge my watch overnight everyday. But what happens on the days i need to use Maps and do other heavy stuff! Bet i could kill the battery in a day.
Just wanted to know if any1 of you guys also had a similar experience with Gboard on your galaxy watch 4 or any other Wear OS watch.
Cheers!"	N

Galaxy S22 Ultra Brings to Life Millie Bobby Brown’s Inspiring Coming-of-Age Story		N
my defective S22 Ultra story	"Coming from an S21 Ultra, I opted to trade in for an S22 Ultra during the pre-order time in February. My order came 5 weeks after I pre-ordered it. While the bundle I ordered came after (Buds 2 came at 6 weeks, Galaxy Watch 4 arrives next week at 7 weeks).
So a relatively apples-to-apples phone switch, I noticed the first day out that my S22U battery was draining down fast. We usually play Pokemon Go from 5-7pm'ish and the first day, when we got back to our car I was at 15% battery, whereas my last phone (S21U) would be in the 50%'ish range. I gave it a week and even updated to the March 2022 patch but nothing changed. I'd usually end the day at around 2.5 hours SoT.
So since I hadn't sent in my S21U to trade-in I decided to run a test for my sanity. I took both my Ultras and set them both to identical settings. Pokemon Go on, and just left them screen-on on my desk. By the time my S22 Ultra got to 39% battery, my 1yr old S21U was at 60%.
&amp;#x200B;
So I contacted Samsung Technical Support to see how I go about resolving the issue. I thought sending it in for warranty was going to be the best option, but they told me to return everything I purchased (phone, buds, watch) and re-place an exact order. Order Support told me they would price-match everything to keep me happy. But now my ""new"" order has anticipated arrival date of April 26 2022.
Fun fact: I have about a week left to initiate the return on my February order, and was told I would then have 15 days to postmark the return. ***Even if*** my new order doesn't arrive.  
All this fuss because of **one** defective device. I feel like the last time I had a defective phone (don't remember what or from where), they just sent me a new replacement with a shipping label to send back my defective device. It sucks because I kind of understand why I have to return everything (bundle was promotional), but also do not understand why I have to return the Buds 2 and Watch because my phone is defective.
&amp;#x200B;
Thank you for coming to my TED Talk, I'll be here all week."	N

I hate my S22 Ultra (exynos)	"I just need to vent and also warn you about buying a new Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra with the Exynos chip. (Excuse my English)
Lets start of with the fact that i love Samsung and think that they make the best Android products by far (in terms of software). I also work with in the tech industry, especially phones for that matter.
So.. I got the Tab S8+ with the Snapdragon chip, the  Galaxy watch 4 and the Air Buds Pro - I got it all! 
I truly love those products. But it is time to get honest with my purchase.. I HATE my S22 ultra with the exynos chip. Slow, choppy, freezing, bad start with the updates, cant even play games on it due to the lack of performance and the camera quality is not close to the Snapdragon chip. 
I feel like my mothers old Oneplus 7t does a better job. This is ridiculous. My S21 Ultra performed better than this. I am so disappointed, a working phone is literally crucial in my line of work. I do everything on it and this one actually makes it more difficult to do my job rather than improving it.
The latest update (March 2022) messed up the playback so all audio output is out of sync. I can't even watch a movie or a YouTube clip on my 1 month old phone!! I know they're going to fix this issue, but still. 
Just end the Exynos chip already, Samsung!"	N
S21+ or S22+?	I have the option to get either one of these phones, however the S21+ will cost way way less for me than the S22+ due to my phone plan. Is the S22+ a significant enough upgrade to not bother with getting the S21+ even at the heavy discount? My current phone is a S10+ to give an idea of what I am working with currently.

S22 cloud storage options	Is there an option to attach cloud storage to the S22, I have an unlimited data plan so I'm fine with the traffic, the problem is that out of the 128GB I have 40Gb is used for my secure folder with work stuff and after that and the apps I'm left with a few gb for photos and videos, it would be ideal if I can find a way to attach a dropbox service like a sdcard for example, being able to save photos and downloads directly to that.

Where's my credit?	One of the big incentives for preordering the Galaxy S22 ultra using the Shop Samsung app was the $250 credit due after the 15 day return period. Now Samsung is running the big Spring sale and we still haven't received the credit. I feel ripped off.	N
IMEI is not from US Device?	I want to enroll my S22+ bought 2 weeks ago into Samsung Care+ and I can't do it because the site said "the IMEI is not a US Device" I bought the device from Samsung directly and tried to call several times customer service and no one can fix this. Any suggestions?	N

Red S22 Ultra 256GB	Has everyone from the 10th of February received their order or their tracking details for the order? Mine is still stuck on customizing. I have seen people who have ordered the same phone and colour receive their order or tracking and they ordered well after the 10th of Feb.So what's going on with my order. CS is no help either. They can only escalate the situation but I don't get anywhere with that.	N
S22 ultra red	Waited since February for this exclusive red color...disappointed to say the least. It is closer to orange than red. If the color was going to be that off, I would've preferred a shade closer to pink. If you haven't ordered yet, just stick to the stock colors of black, silver, or white. DISAPPOINTED	N
Well this is unfortunate	Just received my phone S22 Ultra, I ordered the red one, it's not red. It's actual color is A variation of Orange or Coral orange. Very disappointing to have Samsung insist that the phone I ordered is red	N
New feature suggestion: Extra Brightness Quick Panel toggle	Seeing that there is a button option for Extra Dim in the Quick Panel, it would be convenient to have an Extra Brightness option too for the S22 Ultra.I was walking outside today and had to go all the way into the display settings to turn the mode on. A little inconvenient. Just an idea!	N
Love my S22 Ultra Sky Blue	This phone is gorgeous! Worth the month wait and got a great trade deal for my s21 Ultra. First time using the s-pen.	N
Post here if you receive your pre-order E-Certificate if you bypassed using it at pre-order	"Update: Not more than 5 minutes after i posted this I got the e-certficate in the email. Mods you can delete this if you want, or leave it, its up to you. 
____________________________________ 
So I opted for the $250 e-certificate at time of pre-order instead of having to decide then and there what to get. Both my order page and email confirmation said I would get it 14 days after delivery of the phone. That didn't happen so i contacted Samsung and they pretty much called me a liar and said it was 30 days and to look at my confirmation email. I sent them a screenshot showing it said 14 days. 
Anyways, rather than argue, I figured just wait until the 30 days. It is now 30 days since delivery. 
Wondering if anyone else has received theirs, if not and you remember, come back and post here that you received it. 
(I did get an email this morning that I received my 1200 pending ""rewards"" points for my purchase)"	N

S22/Android 12/Android Auto	"I have held off purchasing a new S22 because I keep reading that Android Auto will not work on the S22/Android 12. Android Auto is one of the key apps that I rely on heavily. Can anyone confirm that it doesn't work and/or that Android Auto is being discontinued on Android 12? 
I also keep reading that Android Auto will be replaced by Google Assistant Driving Mode, but the details are sparse. In particular, my question is that does this Google Assistant Driving Mode work with my car's (2019 Honda Insight) 7.4 inch touchscreen head unit? Can the Google Assistant Driving Mode map be shown on my head unit, or is it entirely limited to the phone screen? If it can be shown on the head unit, is the map and application expanded for the Landscape mode of the head unit screen, or does it fit a portrait mode view of the map onto the head unit screen with lots of blank space?"

Question about android auto connection	"Hi all. I was just wondering what sort of cable is correct for connecting to a wired android auto connection? I have a Kia Stinger which is not wireless so I need to use a USB-A to USB-C cable.  
Can I use any charging cable or does it need to be some specified data cable? I've been using some old cables and connect to Google maps and the infotainment disconnects from Google maps. And then when I attempt to make a phone call, even though I have allowed contact and call permissions, I get an audible massage that says calls not allowed from this service.  
So I'm not sure if I need a different cable with some specified data transmission."	N

God I hope Samsung retains this design	"I missed the pre-order offer bus 😣 I’m most def  getting the s23u . 
Don’t want too much from it just retain the design the curves , the super simple looking back , the green color , maybe sd gen2 and bigger battery but that’s about it. 
This is by far the most perfect all-round utilitarian phone out there. 
Enjoy your beautiful piece of hardware guys. I would treat it with a good screen protector :)

2. Watch... 40mm or 44mm?  I currently have an active 2 (40mm I think) and I'm tempted to go up in size, but scared it will be too big.
3. Experience with the wireless chargers? They have horrible reviews on the website!

Does the S22 Ultra come with a factory fitted screen protector?	"Every samsung S series i bought from the S10 have had a tiny factory fitted plastic screen protector. Even if it doesn't protect much, i basically never use phones with tempered glass protectors. But since the S10, I've seen that the plastic screen protector actually protects the screen from minor scratches. So i was just asking, do they still provide the plastic screen protector with the S22 Ultra? 
Ordered mine in late February and it's still coming😅😅"	N

S22Ultra FedEx box partially opened. Can IMEI be copied/registered fraudulently?	"Hi last week I received my S22 Ultra Package via FedEx from the delivery person. When I looked at FedEx box the bottom was partially opened (the shipping tape came off a little bit and you could access the box's contents). I was concerned so I took the S22U box out and examined if the seals were broken. Luckily they were kept in tact and the S22U was not tampered with or replaced. 
Fast forward to today (about 1 week later). I was on the Samsung 'My Products' page and saw there there 2 devices that was registered.
First one has both serial number and IMEI.
Second has the IMEI AS the serial number and also has the wrong color and memory configuration. It says online exclusive with 256 GB. I did not buy this configuration. The second device also has a button for 'repair service'
I bought burgundy with 512 GB and care+.
Can someone register your IMEI and use your care+ service?
Thanks."	N
Exynos Vs Snapdragon: Does it matter?	"I'm just your average plebeian. I don't game or do any heavy editing on my device.

My question: Given my use, would I even notice the difference outside a few percentage points of battery life?"	N

S22 Ultra (Red) - S21U trade in price match problems	So to explain this situation... I pre-ordered on Feb 9th, and like most, got the delay email where it took about 2 more weeks to show up. In between that time I spoke with 2 different Samsung reps when the trade-in price went up from $700 to $850, and both assured me that they would have the trade-in price adjusted and reflected on my account. Get an email today to trade in my S21U within 5 days, but still shows the $700 trade in amount. Hop on a chat with a 3rd rep and after a few minutes tells me that sorry, you pre-ordered and the 2 other reps provided incorrect info, and you don't get the price match. They offered me some $50 promo BS as if it were even close to a $150 price match. Did a back and forth chat, stated I wanted an escalation, etc and no dice, other than a reoffer of that $50 promo. They did escalate further, but could take 2-3 days. Anyone else have this issue? I am hitting up Samsung US support on Twitter to see if they can fix this.	N
Samsung reward points	"The night I bought my S22 Ultra I thought I read that I had earned points based on what amount I spent. I remember that the points would be available after 30 days. Does anyone have any details about the program?

It's a minor annoyance but still annoying none the less. Anyone have a solution?

Another Samsung overpromise, under deliver on a S22U order	"Another rant on Samsung's overpromising and under delivering.  On March 8, I placed an order for the S22U 512GB unlocked variant in Graphite, and the website (Samsung USA) showed an expected delivery date of March 22.  I get an email the day before March 22 that my order has been impacted due to an unexpected delay and now don't have a new delivery date.  Chatting with Samsung order support was fruitless, both reps giving me the standard canned answer that all customized phones take up to 5 weeks for delivery.  Unacceptable but wanted to get my own rant documented as so many others have not received their new devices even as a pre-order!
I did do a preorder in February and got my white 512GB S22U unlocked variant within reason but returned it since Samsung was offering higher trade-in values and I didn't want the $250 Samsung credit.

I’ve had to moved back to Apple after this Exynos S22U disaster	"I switched to Apple to Android 6 years ago and it was the best thing I ever did. Every phone was perfect, but from S20u it began to slip.
S21U to me was absolutely perfect at everything it did, even when it was the exynos variant.
Now the S22U Exynos variant I had from launch was nothing but a pain. Sluggish, stuttering on every app, every social media was horrendous even after various updates.
Taking pictures in day &amp; night were just bad and smeared in some pictures. Gone of the days of click and go pictures.
I just couldn’t be a beta tester for the first few months again till Samsung got it right. After 30 days I decided to switch to the Apple 13 Pro Max.
And boy what a difference. I understand it’s been out longer. Buts it’s the simplicity of just taking good videos and pictures. Better app optimisation.

Question: does the S22 takes pictures/video in *actual* HDR?	"I'm not talking about the pseudo-HDR trick tons of phones have had for many years, I mean actual HDR10 or similar where the luminance values are stored as part of the image/video?
It's turned out to be very hard to search for since ""HDR"" + phones inevitably just brings up people talking about the older feature that everything has.
The only way I've been able to verify this feature is by playing around with a phone in-person, since most reviewers don't upload HDR (or don't upload to HDR-compatible platforms), but I don't have easy access to an S22 IRL.
EDIT: also, I only care about the S22 if it matters. The S22+/Ultra are completely irrelevant to me as they're too big."	N

Has Samsung acknowledged the DirtyPipe vulnerability?	"According to various sources (e.g. [xda](https://www.xda-developers.com/dirty-pipe-root-demo-samsung-galaxy-s22-google-pixel-6-pro/)) the DirtyPipe vulnerability is unpatched in the kernel version that the Samsung S22 as well as the Google P6 series shipped with. As far as I know the March update didn't update the kernel patch level. 
Has there been any acknowledgement of this from Samsung or Google, or any indication as to when the kernel update will be coming out to mitigate this? As far as I'm concerned, this vulnerability makes the S22/P6 series a no-go for a security conscious user.
I am still waiting on my S22, but I might be sending it back unless this is confirmed to be fixed within the return period."	N

Horrible scroll stretching feature	I don't know what the actual feature is called but I cannot stand how in the new Android when you get to the end of a scrolling area it stretches the screen it bounces back. I have noticed that the Amazon app on the s22 plus somehow thinks you should be able to scroll left and right so now the screen constantly bounces/stretches left and right as I scroll through the app which is disorienting and I would think this is making some people dizzy. Does anybody have a fix for this or know how to disable this feature?	N

Fixes for S22 Ultra Exynos lag that I've found work (until Samsung patches the problems themselves)	"Hi all so I was pulling my hair out at the framedrops, laggy navigation gestures and slow / choppy app switching on this ""flagship phone"" and after a lot of testing have found some fixes...
Now I'm a believer in not turning off any features, this is a smartphone after all but here are some of the tweaks I've found actually fix the above issues until Samsung updates these devices themselves:
1. Turn resolution down to FHD+ - I hated doing this but this made a huge impact on smoothness, just seems like right now the 2200 can't handle WQHD+ and 120hz
2. Increase RAM plus to 8GB
3. Install good guardians and thermal control and increase the thermal threshold so it doesn't throttle as easily
4. Turn off homeup app switcher 
5. Go into settings, apps and show systems apps and set One UI home, all the gestural navigation apps, system UI to unrestricted under battery
6. Always keep in optimised mode
7. Turn off vibration for navigation gestures - I don't know what they've done but the vibration comes too late when swiping and makes this feel more choppy than it is so I kept vibration on for everything else but turned off for gestures.
8. Download booster on good guardians and run this once every two weeks or so
9. Set auto reset to every night
10. Wipe cache partition
Now these are by no means long term fixes, they just make this phone feel snappier until the April update that I hope will fix all of these issues anyway....
I tried to keep as many features enabled as possible but the biggest loss right now is the WQHD+... Hopefully Samsung fixes all of the above in April.
Hope this helps...

Verizon S22 Through Best Buy	"Checking on anyone who preordered their Galaxy S22 for Verizon through Best Buy.
It seems like the other carriers have already shipped or at least provided a status on the expected date. Verizon models have the worst of all the reviews because no one has received their phone yet. 
When I called BestBuy a few weeks back, they said they're at the mercy of Verizon shipping them the phones after they've done their customizations. I'd cancel my order and just go through Verizon directly but the free memory upgrade makes it cost prohibitive. 
Any input from others who pre-ordered their Verizon S22 through Best Buy is appreciated!"	N

S22 5G refuses to connect to 5G after switching phones	"Hi.
Ever since I switched from my S20 5G to an S22 5G, I am now unable to connect to 5G UC.
At first, my S22 was able to connect to UC. However, as the days went on, I was starting to notice that my phone is stuck on LTE, and has simply stopped connecting to UC, only ever rarely connecting to it.
I know for a fact that this isn't a problem with coverage, as I have checked as of writing this post.
And yes, I have tried toggling connectivity modes and using airplane mode, and yet the problem still persists.
What do I do? Is there a certain setting in my phone that I must enable? Is this a problem caused by hardware issues? Is it anything else that I don't know of?"	N

Unlocked S22+/Ultra have Wifi-Calling on AT&amp;T?	"I've tried doing some research but am trouble finding hard answers so I wanted to see if anyone knew from experience. Do the Unlocked S22+ and S22Utra ordered through Samsung's website have Wifi-Calling with AT&amp;T?
I live in a cellular deadzone and wifi-calling is an absolute must for me, however I know from experience AT&amp;T can be extremely finnicky on not allowing wifi-calling on past phones if you bought them unlocked from the manufacturer. I can buy the AT&amp;T model if needed, but I prefer unlocked due to the much less bloat.
Follow up question would be how are you liking your 22+ or Ultra? I'm coming from the Note 20 Ultra, and I'm very torn because I REALLY REALLY hate the curved display of my Note, and would prefer both a flat screen and something slightly smaller. And the 1080p screen doesn't bother me since the 6.9inch Note would only allow 120hz refresh at 1080p, so if anything the S22+ might actually look sharper lol.  However I am also the ""must have the latest and greatest"" guy and would obviously like the better screen and cameras on the Ultra. I've also been extremely disappointed in my Note's 4500 mlh battery life pretty much the entire time I've had it, though I will admit I am a power user and consume a lot of media content.
With my trade-in values I can get the 256gb 22+ for $260, or the 128GB Ultra for $280."	N
S22 Ultra 1TB (UK) Should I cancel my order?	"I ordered a S22 Ultra 1TB in sky blue on the 14th Feb, so far Samsung have stated it's still being customised and had an expected delivery date of the 14th March.
Their customer chat services have so far stated that they would text/email as soon as they have a more accurate date.
I'm leaving the UK for a month in April (14th) which is three weeks tomorrow.

my s22 ultra battery life sucks?	I'm averaging 5-6 hours SOT max, doing nothing out of the ordinary. Wi-Fi 90% of the time, LTE the rest.

I applied it and  I am really impressed, it works flawlessly, I can bet that this is the same quality as 'Whitedome' that costs you a lot.

I am just loving the base S22	"Hey so I'm an avid lurker of this subreddit and I've gathered a bunch of great info from others here last month so I hope I can help people that are still considering the S22 range. 
Firstly I'm located in Australia so I believe I have the qualcomm model of the Galaxy S22.
This thing is just an absolute beast. It's my most favourite phone I've had to date. 
My previous phone was the Xiaomi Mi 8 which I got back in 2017, that phone was great for running fast, taking great photos and holding a solid battery life. The base S22 just feels like an upgrade of that, with a sleeker form factor, crazy camera quality improvements and the battery life could last me 2 days if I needed. 
I recently decided to get the iPhone 13 and returned it 6 days later due to a downgrade from my Xiaomi phone in multiple areas so this is the first time I have preordered a phone. 
The addition of DeX on this device essentially means I'm carrying around a small PC which is insane on what I've currently seen it can do. The removal of big bezels around the edges means it can be a smaller form factor than my previous phone but have the same screen. 
I just thought I'd add my 2 cents on the base model because I usually wouldn't go for a smaller phone but it's easily an upgrade and I'm loving it on so many levels! 
P.S. I got the black colour and it looks sleek as!"	N

About the standby battery drain on Exynos (And maybe Snapdragon?)	"I've been wondering why the standby battery drain was so high since I left my Galaxy S8. I got a Galaxy S20 and S22 and they both have an unreasonable screen off battery drain.
I decided to try to investigate what could cause the issue and made a bugreport dump from my device. Although I am not a professional developer or anything, I was able to notice few things.
First of all, I noticed that ImsService and sec-battery-monitor keeps causing unreasonably long wake locks (See screenshot #1 and #0)
Also, the kernel and the CPU are always running when the device screen is off, even if doze mode is enabled. I tried to compare to a Xiaomi IMUI device and this issue does not seem to happen (See screenshot #2)
Lastly, I noticed that qcom\_rx\_wakelock and cnss-qca6490 (which I believe is the Wi-FI) seem to be quite aggressive, waking up the phone very often even on doze mode. This is also what seems to be causing the kernel wake up while the device is in doze mode. (See screenshot #3)
I sent an error report to Samsung about this, let's hope they fix it
**TLDR; The phone keeps the CPU always on when it's on standy (see Screenshot #2) which doesn't seem to be normal. Sadly, this standby drain is what causes a good chunk of my drain, draining almost 20% over an entire day, my screen on time is very good however**

S22 vs S22+ size comparison?	"Hello
I preordered the S22+ in Sky Blue.
Meanwhile I have been watching other reviews of this phone and I started wondering if I had better bought the S22.
I come from the S9+ and I thought that maybe a smaller phone could have been better. I usually put the phone in my pockets.
But on the other hand the S22+ seems to have better specs and better battery life.
What do you think? Has anyone regretted choosing the S22+ over the S22 or the other way around?
How big is it compared to the S9+ for those who had a S9+?"	N

All my promised S22 refunds hit today. Thanks for all the info!	"Thanks to this sub I went from the S21 128gb to S22 256GB. For $187.50, and got $150 worth of chargers and cases.
I was able to get the full $390 + $160 trade in match posted here. I was also able to get a $40 refund for my original 2/23 delivery being delayed by FedEx until 3/2. And finally the First Responder discount of $22.50.
I would have paid $200 more if I didn't see the posts here, about shipping delay credits and the enhanced trade in values. The chat was helpful and took care of everything without any push back, even gave reference numbers and emailed me to let me know it was all done a few days ago.
Thanks to those of you who shared your info, I really appreciate it! Can't wait till S23 time."	N

It's a lot of data. Is there any way to transfer Gallery or even backup the info?"	N
Does anyone have sound issues on videos since last update?	"Hi, since the last update, the sound on videos in social media apps (insta, twitter) and streaming apps (Netflix and Youtube) is kind of dephased compared to the video.

Is there a way to disable wireless charging completely?	Weird question I know. Is there a way to disable wireless charging COMPLETELY? Situational, for my purposes. Currently using the official Wireless Car Charger by Samsung. The charger requires to be plugged in because the mount is motorized. I don't necessarily want to be wirelessly charging my phone in the car unless needed. I would like to use the car mount without wirelessly charging. Nothing I can see under Battery options in conjunction with Bixby Routines. Am I SOL?	N
Camera App alternative	I've noticed, especially with low light or high zoom levels, that the default camera app uses some weird smoothing effect on photos. It looks like an AI upscaler plus some sharpness enhancer or something. Is there anyway to disable this? Or is there an alternative camera app I can use that supports all 3 of the phone's lens modes? I don't want to use the Expert RAW app because I still prefer to save jpeg, not raw. I just hate the heavy post-processing that is being done to my images.	N

Another Note 20 Ultra - Should I Upgrade Post	I read through a bunch of older posts from folks asking about whether it's worth it to upgrade to the S22 Ultra from the Note 20 Ultra. Right now Samsung is offering $850 for the Note 20 Ultra 5G trade-in. I wasn't going to upgrade, but now I'm reconsidering. The only real issue I have with the Note 20 is the battery is starting to show it's age - it frequently dies before I go to bed. Do all of you think that next year the Note 20 Ultra will still be included in the higher tier trade-in values and I should wait it out, or should I spend the $350 now for the S22 Ultra upgrade?	N

Reddish/pinkish screen on Galaxy S22 Ultra when tilted	"I bought a Galaxy S22 Ultra and noticed that when I tilt it from the bottom, if there is a white image, the screen tends to be reddish/pinkish.
I am familiar with amoled screens and I know that if you tilt the phone from top to bottom it tends to green, but from bottom to top I've never seen a screen that turned red. It is very annoying.
I have compared it with the Galaxy S22+ and Galaxy S21+ of friends but I have not noticed this problem.
I went to a shop today and compared it to the exposed Galaxy S22 Ultra and it had the same problem.
I am undecided whether to replace it, I don't want to be without a phone for 1 week, Has anyone else noticed similar problems?

I have a S22 Ultra but I haven't switched over from my Note 20 Ultra. Can't seem to make the switch. (My note story and review)	"I worked at T-Mobile from 2008 - 2017. In the early years it was an amazing time to be an employee, it was the dawn of the smartphone age. Google had just released the G1 a T-mobile exclusive the first Android phone on the market. AT&amp;T was riding high with its exclusive iPhone contract, and Verizon was in bed with Blackberry furiously promoting the Blackberry Storm. 
During those first years at Tmo I was into HTC Android phones and for the first few years of my employment there it was our best defense against iPhone. Even after Verizon finally gained access to it. As a sales representative I had to get creative and really try hard to convince customers why Android was a better phone, and why they should switch to T-Mobile. 
In all my effort, I myself became a loyal Android fanatic and told myself HTC is the way to go. The HTC One was a superior device to the first Samsung Galaxy which was such a turn off with its plastic body. 
Alas T-Mobile finally launched the Note 2, and my first time holding the device I fell in love. Since then every Note excited me more than the last. 
The Note 10 was the only generation I skipped because the Note 9 was such a fantastic device I couldn't let it go. 
When the Note 20 Ultra was released I felt this was the ultimate Note. It had everything I ever wanted in a phone, the screen size, camera, SD card slot all of it was finally perfected. 
Due to a LARGE error on T-Mobile's part and being a customer/employee with them since 2008 they sent me a free S21 Ultra earlier this year. I kept it in its box, didn't feel I needed to open it because I have been so happy with my Note 20 Ultra. Not to mention I didn't like the way it felt in my hands. 
When the S22 Ultra was announced I decided to trade in the s21 and get myself a S22 Ultra. I'm not sure what it is about the S22 Ultra but it is the first time I haven't felt ""excited"" about a ""Note"". Nothing about it really excites me, it reminds me of the Note 20 Ultra, so much so that I haven't bothered switching my info over from my Note 20. 
I recently went on a trip overseas and I took both my devices with me to test them out. A few things I noticed. 
The S22 Ultra camera and performance is superior. This is obvious due to being 2 generations newer, but one can't deny the camera hands down beats any camera on any Note device by miles. 
Battery life, screen brightness, and everything else was the same. Unless I was taking pictures, or running multiple apps like Uber and Citymapper I couldn't even tell the difference between the two phones. 
Maybe a lot of my lack of excitement for the S22 Ultra is a subconscious protest to the death of the Note name. Either way how has your experience been for those of you who have made the switch?"	N
Unlocked S22 Ultra Samsung visual voicemail not working	"Hey guys, on my S22 ultra the samsung visual voicemail app stopped working after swapping in a Tmobile sim for a few hours. When I put my verizon sim back in, after the phone restarted the voicemail app would be stuck endlessly on checking account details, eventually the app would time out and give a generic error and ask to try again.
I called Verizon and they messed around with my account for hours with no luck. I also reset network settings, reset the voicemail app cache and got a new sim card.
Anything else I can try or anyone else having this issue? 
Thanks!"	N
ATT S22 Trade-in deal after already purchasing/agreeing to financing full amount through ATT.com pre-order.	"Hi all,
I pre-ordered the 256 GB Galaxy S22 Ultra from ATT and selected to finance the full amount (Roughly $33 per month).  I didn't realize that the trade-in option was available for almost all older Samsung Galaxy Note phones, and after ordering realized I had an old Note 3 sitting in my closet.  I just received the S22 Ultra today and have not activated it yet.   Am I able to still go up to the ATT store and trade in my note 3 and get the $800 trade-in value via the monthly statement credit in order to reduce my monthly payment amount?  Thanks ahead of time."

the S22 Ultra in red isn't even close to red	"Just received my s22 ultra in exclusive red. I was nervous it was going to be a burnt orange from unboxing videos. I open it up and it's literally pink. There's nothing red about it. I was excited for the shade of red displayed on the Samsung website actually. This phone looks awful.
I'm furious that I did the whole pre-order and spent 200 bucks more for what appeared to be a cool color over a tmobile standard color. I'm definitely going to try and exchange this.
If you have a red on the way, be forewarned you're getting a orangish pinkish phone depending on the lighting.
Update: Samsung won't exchange and keep my pre order deal. I waited all this time for a pink phone and can't even exchange it. I'll never buy directly from Samsung again. What a joke."	N
S22 vs S21 FE	Needed some help deciding between the two phones. Which one would you recommend? The price difference is $170 and the things I value most are a good display and camera.

Just got my S22 Ultra!	It just came! I had a pixel 6 pro with a hardware issue and after seeing how poorly customer service handled it and how half baked it was, I was extremely disappointed. I was trying to decide between the Samsung and an iPhone, but decided the Samsung camera was just too good to pass up. It just arrived and I'm hyped to get it all set up. It's my first Samsung. Any tips, tricks, suggestions, or any other advice would be greatly appreciated!	N

S22U advertised as 108 megapixels but I'm only getting 12 megapixel files.	I've been loving the cameras on the S22U but I've just noticed all of the four cameras are only producing 12 megapixel photos. What gives? I can't find any settings that might influence this or any documentation about some sort of image compression. Additionally, I've checked the option to store raw copies of the photos, but I can't tell how to access them. If I import the photos into editing apps like lightroom I only get the JPEG. Kind of a Bummer.	N
Abnormal S22 Ultra Snapdragon Performace	"[Screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/oHcnVPT)
Its been 7 days since I am using the phone, but its performance is not as good as the reviews told.
Initially I thought AI optimization will kick in after a few days, it did two days ago but still same problems
**Problems**
-Device stays warm all the time and really heats up when charging, using camera, high demand apps, games. 
-I get lags and jitters frequently in the UI animations and in app scrolling (youtube, 9gag etc) after some minutes of usage.
-High performance game(PUBG) plays fine initially but after 10-15 minutes it lags really and I see a lot of frame drops eventually after 20mins the game is very frustrating to even play.
-Battery life is around max 5-6hours SOT.
Also the benchmarks (I know, not a reliable indicator but still.) lag far behind those in all the reviews(screenshots attached)
**Online Benchmarks scores for reference**
-**GeekBench**  
Single core 1,220  (vs  996 i got)

S21+ pictures look better than S22 ultra?	Just got my S22 ultra after almost a month of waiting and was excited to snap a few pictures and to my surprise the pictures on the S22 ultra seem darker and more natural while the S21+ look brighter and more vivid? One pro for the s22 ultra is there is definitely more detail.Any notice this as well? Makes me almost want to return the phone.[First picture is S22](https://www.imgur.com/a/1hrsXNZ)	N
S22 Ultra Delayed yet again	I mean ofc Fedex fucks it up and delays the delivery even more. Phone finally shipped 2 days ago and hasn't updated and was supposed to be delivered tonight. Guess what It's not delayed.	N
[UK] Finally getting updates for my Red S22U order!	"Placed my order on Feb 9th with an estimated delivery date of 10th March. A couple days before the 10th I asked Samsung support about the order and one agent assured me I was getting it on the day, but I asked again the day before and was told it was gonna be delayed and might take at least a week before I get any updates. The order was at the processing stage this entire time, and over the last weekend I received an email saying the phone is now being customised.
I go back onto the Samsung site today to check my order and see that it's now at the ""Customisation Complete"" stage, and I also noticed that the text saying ""Arrives on 10/03/2022 Delivery in 4 weeks"" now says ""Arrives on 10/03/2022 Delivery in 6-7 weeks"". (Also, did anyone else's S22/+/U order emails have mentions of the Galaxy Fold? My order confirmation told me to ""get ready for your new Galaxy Fold"". And the more recent order update email had the text saying ""Customizing your Galaxy Fold"" lol)
For those of you that have already received your orders, how long did it take for your order to be shipped from the customisation complete stage?
Somewhat off topic now, but I've also seen the recent post mentioning the red phone's colour. I guess it'll depend on how it looks in person but I've been looking at wraps from Dbrand to get a nicer, more vibrant red look but it doesn't seem like they have any ""clean"" ones (two red ones I saw was a carbon fibre pattern, and an MKBHD edition one that has black icons all over), but I haven't bought anything from them before so does anyone have any other recommendations?"

S22 Ultra Back Cover Scratch Fix	"After having my phone for about a month, I've had 2 large scratches put on the back from keys (I have the burgundy). I would take a picture but I have no way to do so. 
Anyways, I rubbed some Meguiar's scratch-x over it, which is used for car paint and you can get at any auto parts store, and it almost completely removed the scratches. 
I figured I was boned and tried this as a last resort and found that it actually works. Hopefully this helps someone else who was as hurt as I was when I scratched my back cover."	N

Worst Customer Experience I've ever had - S22 Order	I ordered my S22 on February 19th.It is now March 24th and I'm still as in the dark as when I first ordered it.I've talked with a rep. who told me in would arrive a week ago.After it didn't I spoke to a second rep. who seemed to get mad at me for not understanding that the customn colours said "Please allow up to 4 weeks for delivery"Its been well past 4 weeks.I'm still in the dark - I only just got an emial the other day telling my it was delayed....Yeah no ****. That's pretty obvious.To make matter worse - There tracking page is down. So I went from being in the dark to being left in the black abyss.The fact the Samsung hasn't been more transparent about the problems and letting customers know whats going on is making this the worst customer experience I've ever had.I'm pretty set on cancelling my order if it doesnt arrive end of this week.I've had a one plus phone for years and there's no doubt in my mind that's where I'll be going next.

Absurd shipping restrictions	The shipping restrictions on anything over 500 dollars is ridiculous, ordering online is supposed to be easier than going to a store but not allowing an order to be held at a FedEx drop makes it hard for people who work during the day.

Always on Display Timeout S22 Plus	Hi,I'm new to Samsung and android and was wondering whether there is a way to set a timeout when a new notification arrives.At moment i have 'always on display' enabled for new notifications but i want the screen to turn off after x amount of time say 15 seconds when the notification comes in.I've turned off always on display but all i hear is a sound but i want to glance at my phone rather then having to pick it up to find out what notification it is.i've tried the tap to show option but again this is no good as i'd like to just briefly look at my screen without having to do anything.On the iPhone the display would turn on when a notification comes in and after few seconds it would turn off. is that possible with an android/ samsung phones?Solved!Go to Solution.

Can you believe that the agent told me that the credit expired!!! I am so fraking upset! This must be a **bleep**g joke! So if you do not use the complete credit at once you lose it? Where is this on your website? If that is the case why would anyone not use the entire amount of the credit!This is false advertising and very misleading!I have been purchasing cell phones directly thruSamsung directly for the past 6 years I have 3 different Samsung phones I recentlypurchased 2 last month and in the past too!

External ways to cool down phone?	I did a lot of filming today at Disney land and although I maintained good battery health throughout the day at around 75% (using my Anker portable charger) by having my display set to the lowest resolution, extra dim half way, greenify auto closing apps while on doze mode, and power saving on, my phone would get pretty hot, especially when I'd be on a ride that was in direct sunlight the whole time. So I'm wondering if anyone knows of any effective methods for a quickly cooling down my phone because what I was having to do was putting it in my backpack against a cold water bottle while I waited in line and when it was cool enough, I would then charge it. I'm hoping that there's some kind of product specifically for this, else I'll just have to come with a pack of ice next time in a heart resistant bag and just drop my phone in there within a zip lock bag. Also, is it bad if my phone get too cold? Like would it damage anything just as heat ruins the battery? I'm on the S22 Ultra and was filming in 4k 60fps with my DJI OM4 btw.	N
Reddish/pinkish screen on Galaxy S22 Ultra when tilted	I bought a Galaxy S22 Ultra and noticed that when I tilt it from the bottom, if there is a white image, the screen tends to be reddish/pinkish.I am familiar with amoled screens and I know that if you tilt the phone from top to bottom it tends to green, but from bottom to top I've never seen a screen that turned red. It is very annoying.I have compared it with the Galaxy S22+ and Galaxy S21+ of friends but I have not noticed this problem.I went to a shop today and compared it to the exposed Galaxy S22 Ultra and it had the same problem.I am undecided whether to replace it, I don't want to be without a phone for 1 week, Has anyone else noticed similar problems?I leave you some images for verification with your phone:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/112UppJ-NFURNfnRR4iMA5qGd4-3AXrZd	N

Camera RAW	Dear Samsung,Please consider this for next cameraapp update.An option to save only RAW images.Most people who chose RAW don't necessarily need the JPEG version.Yes, there are some times when both is required. For the most part they are not..because they would do their own development , processing or edting.Doing this will save more storage space.I have those options on my Canon..so it is editing..Thank you..	N
S-View cover	Samsung for the S-View cover on the S22 Ultra and S22 series, you should be able to swipe right and see your notifications. The fact you can view notifications on the Galaxy Z flip, and Galaxy watches with smaller displays is ridiculous that on a bigger screen that feature was dropped. Also advised watch faces for the clock choices are missing. If anything make the customization of this small cut out like the customization on the Galaxy watch 4. Since it's pretty much based on it. But for a stretch allow widgets, or for the S22 ultra only allow you to write small little notes in that window. May seem pointless but it would be a nice feature to have in a pinch.Solved!Go to Solution.	N

How accurate is Accubattery?	"Hi all. Just for s...ts and giggles I downloaded this app, used my phone to 50%, (from 75%) and then recharged to 75% again.  
I was shocked to see my battery health rated by Accubattery at 97%. This is an almost new phone and when I got the phone, my first 2 charges were to 100% using an older slow 10W charger. After that battery protection was turned on and most of the time I have charged to maximum 80% with the majority of times charging to mid 70's% and never dropping below 50%. Basically I have treated the phone with respect to charging like a baby.  
Also, I remember a few years ago Samsung touting their new batteries as losing only 5% capacity in the 1st year.  
So is this Accubattery correct or just a load of nonsense? Maybe others would like to test it for themselves. This is one of the extremely few features of iPhone that I wish Samsung had. An inbuilt battery health indicator."	N
On the fence for S22U because N20U crappy camera	"I don't want to lose MST and micro SD but I hate to admit I think the N20Us camera is crappy. I don't recall a smartphone camera that was disappointed with like I am with the N20s. It seems to always have focus problems and blurry pictures
I took a video at a concert and it was gawd awful.  
I took comparison pictures at Best Buy and there was a huge difference. Micro SD and MST are very valuable to me but I do want a decent camera and the N20U doesn't cut it. 
Is there a camera setting you use on your N20U that makes it take great pics? I'm trying to justify keeping this phone but with blurry pictures it's not easy"	N

Samsung suggested using Textra MMS but it screwed up my phone so I had to uninstall it.

Is There A Way To Restore Single App Settings?	"This question was brought on by the long discussion(s) we've been having about the Google Messages app.  
In order to roll back the Samsung variant and install the open beta, we have uninstall all updates, which also deletes all the app data. I don't want to have to manually reassign all my personalized notification tones for my contacts. 
Is there a way, via Google, Samsung, or 3rd party (without root), to backup and restore just a single app's settings?  
I can't find a way to do this via Google and the method we use when setting up new phones. That's an all or nothing restore as far as I can tell.

YouTube mini mode issue	"Hi there. So I'm casting YouTube to my TV and then I minimise the video whilst I scroll around YouTube searching for other content. The minimised mode looks like as per the 2nd screenshot, with a pause button, title description of the video and queue information.  
I then turn the phone display off for a few minutes and when I turn the display back on, the minimised mode has changed, as per the 1st screenshot. With no usable functionality as you can see. When I press on the minimised tab, it's prompting me to ""play the video"" on my casting, something that is already in progress.

S22 Ultra - Exynos vs Snapdragon!	"I found my S22 Ultra photos sometimes lacked detail, also blacks are blue-ish and indoors at night photos often have a yellow hue (my white cat's fur gets a yellow cast).

I wish I lived in America to get the Snapdragon. So annoying here in Europe we have to put up with lesser performance and worse photo processing every year. At least the battery looks to be the same this time. 
I'm still enjoying my phone, but it's annoying seeing issues in my photos and knowing if I bought the exact same phone in the USA I would not have these issues..."	N

The absolutel best trick to improve battery life!	"A few days ago someone in this subreddit talked about how turning auto brightness off can increase battery life...and I thought: well not one of these ultra special hacks again. 
Still I gave it a try for the last two days and went from my 4 to 4.5 hours of SOT way up to the 6 and 7 hour mark! 
I have the exynos version with 8gb ram and use the phone with adaptive refresh rate (because reducing it to 60hz is a shame to this phone) but instead I only use FHD+ because you can't really tell a difference to UHD+.. right? 
But I was so mad for the last month that this huge battery gave my the same battery life as my previous Z Flip3 while last year's S21U was quite good with it's 7h of SOT. 
So turning off auto brightness is one fox for bad battery life for now and totally fine for me to do that but still let's hope Samsung can improve the software with the next updates!"	N

Overnight Charging Battery Health Solution	"You may like charging  your phone overnight and having 100% charge when you wake up. However, there is concern about the long-term battery health. Samsung recommends limiting the maximum charge to 85%, but you may want to start your day with 100%. 
Here's a simple option: 
1. Settings -&gt; Advanced features -&gt; Bixby Routines (enable it and go in)
2. My Routines -&gt; Charging - &gt; Edit
3. In the ""If"" condition, add ""Time period"". Here you will adjust the time according to your sleep schedule. For example, if you sleep 11PM-7AM, set the time period for 11PM-6:30AM (more on this below). Click Done. 
4. In the ""Then"" condition, click Add -&gt; Battery -&gt; Protect battery. You will be prompted with ""To extend the lifespan of your battery, limit the maximum charge to 85%."" Click On and Done. 
This Bixby routine allows your phone to maintain a charge limit of 85% until about 30 minutes before you wake up. The phone will then charge to 100% by the time you wake, so your battery is not as stressed maintaining 100% charge all night/morning. 
There's plenty of anecdotal evidence suggesting leaving your phone fully charged overnight is not a big deal. I charged an S10+ overnight for over two years and had 90% health by the time S22 Ultra released. Manufacturers are engineering ways to maximize battery health according to our habits, but some of us want to make sure we go 3+ years before our next upgrade. Specs are great, but they can only go as far as the battery allows. 
Here are two videos on phone battery health: 
[Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpqaQR4ikig) \- The whole video is informative, but fast forward to [11:02](https://youtu.be/UpqaQR4ikig?t=662) to see how other manufacturers are managing overnight charging. The above Bixby routine does the same.

Side Bezel Protection	"I've been running the gamut of cases to determine what should grace my S22U's behind, but - for the life of me - I cannot find a case whose side bezels are raised enough to protect the display (with a glass screen protector installed). The two hottest contenders so far have been the Mous Limitless 3.0 (love the magnet) and the UAG Monarch Kevlar (most protective I've tried to date and snazzy to boot). At the end of the day, however  both of these would be defeated by drop onto a corner, as only their top and bottom edges are raised above the glass.
I'm perplexed by the fact that I don't see others mentioning the low side bezels in their reviews. Should I be adjusting my protection expectations for this phone?

Bellroy leather case review	"Quick review of this admittedly expensive case.
The fit is more or less perfect. It snaps in securely and the sides come up a decent amount, and there's a lip on the top and bottom even when using a tempered glass screen protector. The buttons all feel good, and the top and bottom and P camera cutouts are aligned. Perhaps most importantly, the side rails are solid and don't peel back when you tug on them.
The leather is amazing, it smells great, and they've done a good job melding it to the harder parts of the case.
My only real gripe is that they kept the case uniform on the bottom and as a result, it's slightly difficult to remove and replace the S Pen from the holder. You really need to use your fingernails to pop it in and out.
Overall I am biased towards leather goods in general and I will be using this one most of the time. My other cases are the Spigen slim card case, ultra hybrid, Ringke fusion, and a generic aramid from AliExpress. I'll probably use the ultra hybrid when I don't want to wreck this leather one (i.e. painting, working in the yard, etc).

Samsung support stringing me along and lying about credits and refunds due. What recourse do I have? Can I file a dispute with my CC company for a partial refund?	"As they instructed me at the time these tickets were opened, I waited until after the phone was delivered. I contacted them over a week ago to get the $50 and $80 refund on my phone. Nearly everyone I spoke with via the chat and phone support told me that they won't do more than one refund and I have to ""pick one."" All of these are for different things, different days, and some even weeks apart. The $80 refund was contingent on me keeping the order with Samsung, and this was from FEB 16, I didn't receive my phone until MAR 17.
It seems like Samsung is making a habit of lying to keep a sale. This is highly concerning because they owe me, so far:
1. $50 refund - (5% refund, up to $50)
2. $80 refund - (7.5% refund due to ""price matching"" the app vs the website)
3. $160 refund - (refund for when my trade-in phone makes it back to samsung, matching the trade-in price before vs after preorder sales)
4. $20 promo code - (offered by support on MAR 11)
I am omitting a lot of context here, but trust me all but the $20 promo code are legitimate, justified and backed by chat logs and screenshots. The $20 was offered by support one time when I checked in on my order, so I thought I'd throw that in there. I'd be happy enough without that.
Not to even mention they still owe me the $250 voucher to Samsung.com, but they still have 5 days to deliver on that one.
I am going to exhaust all avenues through Samsung.com support but I'm not going to make this a full-time job to get back what I'm owed. What course of action should I take after this? Can I file a partial dispute with my credit card company? Will Samsung brick my phone if I do that?"	N

battery optimization: what's better "not restricted" or putting it on the "never sleep" list? Can't have both.	"My phone has  2 options that are mutually exclusive.
1:  I can enter App Info and directly tell the app in the  battery options to ""never be restricted"".
2:  In the Samsung Battery menu I have 3 lists ""sleep, deep sleep, never sleep""
But if I set 1 I can't put the app on the ""never sleep"" list and If I have it there, I can't use option 1.
&amp;#x200B;
So I have to decide. What's the better setting for an important app to keep working?"	N

Yesterday I bought the original Samsung 45W charger, and then I read the posts here and I realized it's old. (EP-TA845). Did I make a mistake ? What should I do ?	"Should I return it ? I think they don't even sell the new 45W chargers in my country yet, the latest one here is TA845 one. What should I do ? Is this not compatible with S22 Ultra ?
It shows Super Fast Charging 2.0 while charging."	N
Request: Could I ask for a couple of Expert Raw photo files?	"Hey all,
I'm trying to figure out what phone I want between the Galaxy S22 Ultra and the Sony Xperia 1 iii. I'm looking for a phone that can make some decent RAW files for editing.
I bought the Xperia, and I think their pro camera and cinema apps are awesome but I'm not quite sure I want to keep the phone (coming from an old Galaxy S9).
Anyways, I was wondering if anybody would be willing to send me some of their RAW photos from their S22? I'm just now learning that Samsung is doing some cool stuff with multi-shot RAW and I wanted to compare the files against the Xperia. 
Thanks!"	N

anyone got a S22 graphite in Germany yet?	"I ordered my S22 in graphite on the 22nd of february and got my Galaxy Buds last week. It said 4-6 weeks when I ordered it (because of the special color).
Anyone got theirs yet?"	N
I shall give my free award to anyone who can beat this. 9hr45min SOT with 10% left. FHD+, Adaptive refresh, processing speed optimized, no power saving options, no adaptive battery options, hella apps in deep sleep. S22 Ultra AT&amp;T Snapdragon 512gb. Good luck! May the battery Gods be in your favor.		N

Best USB-C to 3.5mm Adapter?	"I've seen a ton of different brands with issues ranging from incompatibility to latency to poor audio quality.  Can anyone suggest a dongle that will play nice with the S22?
(preferably black but I'll take what I can get)"	N
Anyway to make system icons only show after swiping open the quick panel?	I experimented a bit with Quickstar, but I don't want to turn off the icons permanently. Is there a way to hide the notification bar until I swipe down from the top to briefly reveal the icons before it fades again?	N

pls suggest screen protector compatible with fingerprint sensor	"Hi, s22 is my first phone with this kind of unlocking(coming from s7). I have Spigen glass screen protector and my experience is terrible. Sometimes I will unlock the phone on 2nd try, sometimes I will give up after like 10 tries... It's either   ""press harder""  or ""cover whole sensor message"". I have a fey specks of dust but far away from sensor area under my protector(not sure if it matters)
Need your advice on which glass screen protector to get for unlocking after each try instead of totally random as it is no"	N
speaker issue solved!	"I thought my speakers on my s22 were broken. This was the day I set the phone up. I came to reddit and saw some of us had the same problem. I tried the [Equalizer thing ](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS22/comments/tbabca/greatly_improve_the_speakers_quality_with_this/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=sh) and that helped. I did the squeezing thing, which also made a difference but only made me notice the issue more.  
HERES WHAT WORKED FOR ME: using a similar equalizer setting for a while (2 days). Last night, I played a podcast or 2 to fall asleep to, and now I think it's fixed. I turned off the equalizer setting and it's good again. No crackle, or tin sounds.
I think the speakers needed to be worn in a little, kidna like how a screen protector needs to be pressed over time to stay on. I'm no expert, just giving what i believe to be true. So just go easy at first."	N
How does 85% battery protection work? is it the same as unplugging my charger at 85%?	Can I keep my phone plugged all night if this feature is enabled?	N

How to get GBoard dynamic color Android 12?	Hi guys. I bought a S22U couple of days ago and I had GBoard with dynamic color, matching the palette I chose when changing wallpaper but I had to change region (CSC) and now I don't anymore, is still One UI 4.1, A12, and even a newer firmware, I don't get why it's not picking the color palette	N
What's your experience with S22 (base) exynos so far? Help me choose between this and iphone 13 mini.	"For the first time, I am about to buy a flagship phone and I am trying to decide between these two.
I really like the size of the iphone and the reliability of iOS but I hate that ugly notch and how restrictive iOS seems to be (I have never used an iphone before).
On the other hand, I would prefer to stay with Android but I am not sure if I want to deal with all the bugs/sub par battery life people have been mentioning here. Also I would like to keep my next phone for as long as possible and I am not sure how a Galaxy phone  will stand the test of time.
If I decide to go with the galaxy it will be the Exynos version. How is everyone’s experience with S22 exynos so far?"	N
Expert RAW not really good on S22u (oversharpened and jpg-like artifacts).	"The app description claims ""details are best preserved"". But just seems to put a JPG into a DNG container and offers no highlights or shadow recovery. **At this point I don't believe this app is creating real RAW files** (only the stock app does)**.**
In reality its oversharpened on 1:1 level.
[expert vs normal](https://preview.redd.it/e3hnmwk84xp81.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d6316bb6d7dd5c4e76672319fdbf3dc7bcb947a)
And loosing details in dark areas of higher ISO photos creating a heavy jpg like compression patterns in dng files. And no shadow recovery as you would expect from a raw file and works with the dng from the standard app. This is the whole image, not a partial one. Also those compressed looking dngs are also half the file size of the real one.
[normal vs expert](https://preview.redd.it/a536vvc94xp81.jpg?width=1157&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4c033ddf21713c8289c19a3639b3b36ed3f8478)

&amp;#x200B;
As mentioned below I also checked the highlight recovery and noticed its not there. Even the histogram of the ""expert dng"" is empty on the right side, both images are processed the same way. The real DNG on the left recovered details as I turned down the highlights and exposure, the fake one from ExpertRaw just gets dull, like a jpg would behave.

&amp;#x200B;
So is Samsung really just putting a JPG in a DNG Container, creating an app called ""Expert RAW"" that does produce fake raw files?"	N

Thinking about switching to Samsung - benefits of using Samsung phone with Samsung tablet?	Hey all, I currently have a tabs7+ and an iPhone 13 pro but am going to best buy later today to play around with the s22u. I wanted to ask if there are any benefits or features that I’d get if I use a galaxy phone with my tab s7+? Thanks!!	N
HTC Weather Animations	"I have this weird nostalgia for the HTC weather animations. Before switching to Samsung, I used HTC phones way back in the day.
Does anyone know of any way to get the Sense weather animations on Galaxy phones? I've tried just about every HTC Sense clock app on the Playstore, but none of them have the animations. I'm not even sure if it's possible to be honest."	N

Defective Device Replacement Nightmare	"Just wondering if there is anything else I can do and others experience because this is beyond frustrating. My s22 has an issue and I need a replacement. They are telling me I cant just get a replacement and need to send my entire order back including tablet and extras to get the same price (originally they were trying to charge me for a phone without any of the pre order discounts and would cost $250 more overall) So I need to reorder everything at a higher price now, wait another 7 weeks until it ships and then they'll refund the difference. Already sent my old tablet in so while I can use my old phone I'll just have no tablet. This sounds insane all I want is a functional phone.
Edit: well suddenly started working again after 2 days and even factory resetting with no luck. I am now seeing another post where someone with unlocked VZ phone is having problems."	N

Galaxy Wearables app is not detecting my Buds 2 as connected [Galaxy S22 | Snapdragon]	"Got the Buds 2 when I preordered and got them even before the phone. At that time, I managed to connect it with my Xiaomi and use it with the Galaxy wearables app. 
But after I got the phone, it's not getting detected in the app on my S22. The phone is able to pair with the buds and even show the connection prompt when I open the buds nearby. But within the app, it will show the buds as disconnected. So I can't use mamt of the smart features available through app(like equilizer).
The same issue is also present on my Tab S7. Funny how it works fine on a Xiaomi but not the original manufacturer's devices.

Specific Tips Please! 😍	"Hola Samsung​ Galaxy S22 fans! 👋🤣🍦✌️
Over the moon to be joining the Galaxy with my S22.
And have loved the 24 hours that I have had with it.
I have a few queries...
CAMERA SHUTTER SOUND
- How do I turn that off?
LDAC AND/OR APTX
- Is there such a thing? Or am I stuck with AAC?
ACCESSING GOOGLE PHOTOS
- I cannot seem to access Google Photos pictures on certain apps (e.g. accessing a picture from Google Photos when changing my Samsung account photo on my phone, it only allows me to access Samsung Gallery, select from AR emoji or take a new photo)
WIRELESS CHARGER
- Please recommend some wireless chargers. Probably one to leave at the office, so that I can take the phone on and off throughout the work day.
Thank you in advance for your help!

Burning my battery, always on display remaining on when in pocket	"Coming from a 5 year old LG V20, when the proximity sensor would detect something completely obscuring the sensor the AOD would shut off. This doesn't seem to be the case with my SD S22 Ultra. It likes to burn power all day in my pocket when set to 'show always'. 'Tap to show' shouldn't be the alternative either since it simply doesn't make sense to display the time and notifications when they clearly aren't visible to the user. This is coming from a phone that advertises functioning hand waving gestures.
I don't hate the phone, it just bugs me when products regress in terms of functionality."	N
What's the panel on the right side of the Ultra below the power button?	It looks like it opens somehow...There's another one on the top left. They clearly do no depress or open in any way I can see, but I'm also not trying to open them too hard. Are they ports for modules?	N

S22/22+ camera update or future improvement??	hi guys! first post in reddit here and i need your feedback. So i bought the s22 SD ver. after making some good savings. but after a deep non scientific testing on the cameras i got to see is not that good as much as i wanted to be. i mean, yes, smartphones do not upgrade as much each gen. However it made me wonder if there would be a refinement after some time and if samsung does improve the processing by passing some time in a software update. My findings are these. the fine details get lost due to the hdr or night mode photos. i think this is due to the huge sensor sampling to 12 mp. also it could be due to the hdr and night time photos imaging stacking photos do not process as perfectly as other brands. I'm aware of the fact that this could sound neatpicking but i just find the cameras a little unreliable. i compared this against a pixel 4 and a samsung A53 which dissapoints me to say that the cameras are not if not the same (referring to the main camera). Video is clearly another story (positive in fact). To sum up, i just see it as 85% close to a pixel on stills camera with the main sensor (an smartphone from 2018), is this the flagship experience i was suppose to expect?. i know there are other areas on a smartphone, but ignoring battery and performance it just feels i should ve gone on a pixel 6. but they do not sell it in my country which is bolivia. thanks in advance!

S22 Force Restart	"Hi everyone,
So my S22 came in 4 days ago after the late 2md batch PO delivery in Indonesia. It was working fine for 3 days until yesterday it started to force restart a couple of times. Basically all of a sudden the screen would turn black and I had to wait until the Samsung logo come up. This happened a couple of times. 
So I tried going to the service center and they did a data wipe and software reinstallation. They said something about possible unstable wifi during software update causing corrupt software. Later I updated the preinstalled apps and while changing the normal settings (gestures, etc) , the same thing happened again.
Is anyone having the same issue? I don't have autorestart enabled so pretty sure this isn't a scheduled restart.
Edit: was just browsing using Chrome then suddenly it froze and auto restart. Stuck on the samsung galaxy logo for 5+ minutes."	N

Burning rubber smell Tech 21 Evocheck case wireless charginf	"So I've been playing around with the amphere app and jsing different wall chargers and stand chargers because the setup I was using with my S10 plus was barely charging my new s22 Plus. 
I tried the new Spigen 15 w stand charger with one of those cheap quick charge 3 charges you can get on Amazon. I smelt a burning rubber smell so I unplugged it immediately. The wall charger was very hot I ended up throwing it out I think that was the main issue and I'm getting rid of the speaking stand because it's no faster than my old 10 watt anchor. 
I'm now using my old S7 fast wall charger with a 10 w anchor now charging at about 1300 mah and my phone runs around 88-95°F on it. I'm noticing that my phone case (Tech 21 evocheck) smells like burning plastic every time I charge it wirelessly for more than a half hour now.

Upgrading S8-S22 experience	"TLDR; at the bottom.
I've been a T-Mobile customer for almost 20 years, starting back with their pre-paid minute plans. I wanted to order online and have the phone shipped to me. Instead of going to the store to upgrade my phone, which can take between 1-3 hours, and transfer errors.
I went through the app trying to upgrade my phone and do the trade-in, but it kept saying I needed to add a new line. I did not want to do this because I'm still on the Kick Back plan with unlimited data. I started chatting with support, trying to understand my options. After an hour of talking, they said to move forward the would be a $30 fee for assisting the transaction, which seems fair perhaps in-store; over the chat, it did not. 
The rep said I could do it myself and sent me a link and instructions. It accepted my trade-in offer but kept saying I had to add a new voice line. The service rep said I'd have to pay the service fee to process the transaction since I had issues. I got a bit upset that they said I could do it myself with the details we discussed, but I couldn't. My background is in website design and cyber security (blue team), so if I'm having a difficult time, everybody else will.
I left the chat and called customer service and explained my situation. They said the service fee could be waived and proceeded further but later was told the service fee couldn't be waived and would need to be paid but would reflect on my first bill. I went forward with the transaction, which took just a few minutes. 
TLDR; I opted to do the 2-day shipping for the phone, which costs $24, so I saved $6. After signing the digital transaction. I got a notification that T-Mobile would ship my phone in a month. Yeah, read that right. I have to wait a whole month for the phone and paid $24 for 2-day shipping. Fun experience.
Anyways, be aware that shipping may take up to a month; paying a higher amount for faster shipping and haggling a $30 processing fee may not be the best use of one's time. Also, be very careful about upgrading your phone if you're satisfied with your existing phone plan. You'll end up losing it and not be able to go back; I made that booboo once a long time ago."	N

S22 and S22+ honest SOT	"Hey, without any BS please share your SOT for these 2 models. There is not a lot of honest reviews of the battery life out there. I've seen a lot of contradictory opinions which makes me believe most of YT test are paid reviews. 
From what I've heard S22 is beyond terrible, ppl on forums claims 3.5-4.5h SOT, some YT reviews says 7h SOT, which makes no sense. 
And for the fan boys, please don't give me such advice that if I'm a power user and 4.5h is not enough for me I should get S22U. Also I don't want to turn off half of the 'good stuff' life refresh rate etc. just to preserve battery life, if I wanted a medium-end phone with good battery life I would get Xiaomi.
Please share only your SOT (after battery adaptation, this also will be one of the arguments), saying that battery last you for a whole day means really nothing.
I really want to get S22 because of the size and photo quality but I have huge doubts and I'm starting to believe that Samsung screwed up this model, I never had iPhone but 13 pro is the same size as S22 and battery life is brilliant."	N
A Quick review of RED(??) S22U and GREEN S22+ which i upgraded from S21U and Flip3 as a long time Samsung fan	"Kinda bummed that the pic uploading is now prohibited in this sub now, anyway...
Behold... my [Stuff](https://i.postimg.cc/XYq4WHW8/20220303-140037.jpg) and more [Stuff](https://i.postimg.cc/wvHrqMJp/20220303-135126.jpg) and ofc [S22 Ultra ... RED](https://i.postimg.cc/L6CFxtPZ/20220316-200813.jpg). \*(ALL THE MODELS EXCEPT FLIP3s ARE EXYNOS)\*
Probably you would call me a fanboy after those but you got to understand that Samsung offers are very tempting ! So i started going down this rabbit hole last year when i got my S21U (jumping straight from Note 8 ) and i finished the year with two additional Flip3 and a Tab S7+! Then the new lineup came and with them, all new jaw dropping trade-in values for Flip3 phones, so i had to get the S22U for me and a S22+ for my gf! i threw a GW4 in the mix cause why not!
For my Gf's S22+ 256 (Green) upgrade from Flip3 256 (Purple) upgrade i can't really dive deep much into it but since i set it all up for her and from the feedback that i got from her, i can say that she really loves it despite losing the WOW factor of Flip3, the battery is A LOT better , the camera lenses are huge but the Snapdragon processing was different in videography so it's kind of a bummer, Insta knowing the new lenses are huge and the fatness of the new aspect ratio is much better to use in the real world comparing to the narrow and supertall aspect ratio of Flip3. Green looks absolutely stunning and i kinda wish that they made the S22U design as same as the other two.
Now coming to the [RED ???](https://i.postimg.cc/52r12BNM/20220321-033200.jpg) S22U 512GB which arrived 1month+ after i ordered it and all i ever knew about the color was couple of promo picture and videos about it, i thought i would receive a RED phone... but then i received this kinda orange/coral phone that doesn't resemble any RED color in it. i was furious with the fact that Samsung waited this long to send it to me and it couldn't even send it back and get the other one since i would lose the trade-in value for the other phone... here its compared to [Black](https://i.postimg.cc/ZRtSrJd7/20220316-204140.jpg) S21U, jumping from the classy black to that was hard and it started a new dilemma for me since now i had to find a new case to hide that color rather than showing it which was my initial thought about it when i got it , the [Cases](https://i.postimg.cc/L6CFxtPZ/20220316-200813.jpg) that i got for it + [these](https://i.postimg.cc/dVhPphRN/20220326-160043.jpg), tried to find the best case that could cover that color completely and found out that Samsung silicon case is the worst case that i ever used in my entire life with the dirt magnet feature and dog's a$$ feeling on silicon but the leather case wouldn't be that much different going by the reviews in their pages. This [Cyrill](https://i.postimg.cc/nLQxjXC9/20220316-221553.jpg) case doesn't cover the color but since this was the one that i bought for it even before i got the phone the [combo](https://i.postimg.cc/Y2xHWKqR/20220316-221557.jpg) kinda grew on me. i also know that there are countless fellow RED pre-orderers that feel same as me and i suggest them to take it for a ride outside and see if they could match it to their style and attire. i just accepted it since i love the Spen color and nothing beats the smoothness of that Cyrill case so I'm just saying F it and going BOLD with this phone !
So for the comparison coming from S21U to S22U (both Exynos 512Gb version) :
* The RAM might be 4gb less, but that 16gb of ram never EVER helped me in any task, they both keep the same amount of programs in their memory and that was almost exclusive to DEX mode and i just use my Tab S7+ for DEX.
* Camera is a bit improved and not much since the sensors are all almost the same one from before and it's just optimizations all aboard which IMO this should've been done on S21U since they shipped it out with half baked camera and i got most of the features and bug fixes after couple of months of using it. the overheating issues are almost fixed, you can use focus mode in video now, the 108MP camera has a new DETAIL ENHANCER option, auto framing , auto fps modes. but AGAIN the videography indoor / during night is absolutely TERRIBLE on EXYNOS models. almost a budget phone level bad and I'm tired of paying premium for the phone that other regions get the better version of it. Portrait mode is better, the zoom modes are better BUT still you can't switch between lenses in VIDEO mode and you have to keep the shutter button in photo mode to switch to video for the switch in lens option (hidden tip), overall all of these improvements should've been in S21U and S22U should've got the new OLYMPUS sensor.
* Display is a bit brighter in direct sunlight and in HDR videos side by side you can feel the difference in max brightness too but both are in the league of their own as I've never seen anything better than them in any device. and i had mini-led and still use tab s7+. one of the issues that i had with S21U was the green tint in absolute minimum brightness with grey backgrounds that i never found the same issue online as it's extremally hard to prove or explain and i even discussed it with pro at display area tech and they never found that either. I'm glad to announce that it's not happening in the S22U now and that was a huge plus for me too!
* battery life is a bit better, with my optimizations i was getting around 6\~8hrs of SOT on S21U and it's half an hour more with the S22U despite having a Spen and brighter screen.
* the heat issues are the biggest improvement over S21U imo, that phone overheated like crazy after long WhatsApp/duo videocalls, long heavy photoshoots(108mp and single take) and videography. the new heat pipes and the new 4nm Exynos 2200 DO HELP! so kudos to them to finally make a NORMAL phone!
* SPEN! both did support spen BUT now it's in the phone and the biggest selling point for me... the AIR ACTIONS. i really love it since i can use it as a remote CAMERA BUTTON and it's not just for clicking pics, you can zoom in and out , you can switch lenses and such which is not available on any remote BT device. yeah you could've probably got the same feature with a SPEN PRO on S21U but that never came to the markets here and i was tired of waiting for that. and that was not as portable as this little magic wand. i just love air actions and writing every little great thing about it would take another topic!
* Insta, Snapchat do recognize the ultrawide and zoom sensors but still the videos get crushed to oblivion when you upload them in Instagram this is not an issue in iPhones. if you're collaborating with their team at least optimize it all around.
* as for the display issues , GOS and GPS issues, i never had any of those, maybe it's cause i got it a month later or maybe my unit is a later batch than others so that's why I'm not having problem regarding those, i tested GPS outside and used it a full day navigating outside of the city and it was better than S21U in the accuracy part. the benchmarks are in the average spectrum of others that i saw online and nothing extrtionary or bad in that regard either. maybe I'm lucky or they would happen later.
Overall it's a NOTE 22U upgrade the same as years before, a BIT better than the S lineup with SPEN inside, this doesn't feel like a yearly upgrade at all and Samsung are taking the focus from S/Note lineup to the FLIP and FOLD series, they've made an ECOSYSTEM of devices that work well with each other and they are just improving the non-foldable phones to perfection, which i don't mind but this is STILL not perfect as the videography is still not improved as iPhone 13 Pro series with PRO RES capabilities. all they care now is the PHOTOGRAPHY and ZOOM as they get the most headlines but please Samsung... videography is still lacking and even though Exynos models are garbage in that regard, snapdragon version are not that much better and still so much behind of iPhones.
but the reason that i can't switch to iPhones are well know between Samsung fans as the Secure folder , Dex, Spen, goodlock , goodguardian and [THESE CUSTOMIZATION LEVELS](https://i.postimg.cc/jjnBQXhH/20220327-160737.jpg) are not available on iPhones or any android devices. i just wish that Samsung FOR ONCE releases a fully baked phone DAY1 and not just make it better with software updates and region locked apps 6month later.
EDIT:
Adding some experiences about the chargers and compatibility issues with the SAMSUNG SUPERFASTCHARGIN 1.0 (25W) and 2.0 (45W) :
* i bought $hitton of [chargers](https://i.postimg.cc/tJ6dCBFg/photo-2022-03-27-17-17-08.jpg) \[ta800@25w and 2x ta845@45w and couple of 18w random charger\] (+ [these](https://i.postimg.cc/SN07tppY/photo-2022-03-27-17-17-11.jpg)) in the past year or so, cause the finding the suitable charger that could work on Samsung + my laptop was really hard. if you check my post history you can see that i even got the Baseus 120w with my S21U last year but found out that it didn't even work with SFC 1.0 at 25w so had to return it too. so far only Samsung 25w and 45w ones (duh) and Baseus 100w ([don't get it though](https://www.reddit.com/r/UsbCHardware/comments/sthbov/thought_i_found_my_perfect_companion_with_this/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)) work with the SFC 1.0 and 2.0 for Samsung devices. Anker 65w GANII doesn't work with SFC 2.0 at 45w but supports the SFC 1.0 at 25w so i just gave up  and got that one as it was the smallest 65w charger available and the 100w have NOT hit the market yet. (anker 736) and since it did also power my L5Pro laptop too i kept it.
* For the power banks, since i had a PTSD while i was looking for chargers i didn't buy and return them as much as the chargers and after researching it thoroughly i found this [BASEUS 100w](https://i.postimg.cc/tRnN548H/photo-2022-03-27-17-17-10.jpg) 20K power bank that DOES support SFC 1.0 and 2.0 and above all of those support anything that you throw at it including charging my laptop at 100w! so i lucked out at that one and it even has a display built-in to show that the stats of your gadgets charging power. it replaced my chunky and heavy [Ravpower 45w 20K](https://i.postimg.cc/TP86K18Y/photo-2022-03-27-17-22-58.jpg) power bank that i got it 2years ago thinking that I'm future proofing with that but it never charger any Samsung devices above 15w fast charging rate. So thanks Samsung for making new charging rates everyday! yay!
* overall 25w and 45w SFC charging has little to no difference with just 5min difference and Anker65w + Baseus 100w power bank will help me power through rough day at work or travel easily.

Is anyone happy with their S22U?	All I see is complaints and that worried me bc I just ordered mine. I came to this forum to get some tips and tricks, but I see lots of complaints. 😬	N
Galaxy S22 telephoto camera	"From what I've read, the sensor for the 3x telephoto lens on the S22 is 10 megapixels. However, photos taken through that camera have a resolution of 3000x4000 which I believe makes it 12 megapixels.
Anyone knows what's going on here?"	N
PSA - The trim of the S22u is covered in a glossy plastic. Remove it to reveal a nice matte black frame!

Ordered S22 Ultra - Need Charger Recommendation	"From what I can tell the S22 Ultra can handle either 25W or 45W.  I see Amazon has a 45W charger for around $25.
Anybody use either 25W or 45W and can say what the charging difference is?  
Any particular brand of charger you recommend?
Anybody using a wireless charger?  If so, what wattage are you using?  I thought I read that it can handle up to 15 W?
Anybody use the S10 charger while waiting for the replacement charger?  I would understand that it's slower, but seeing if that would work for the time being."	N

i feel like the galaxy s22 ultra isnt as good as it should have been.	"guys , this is all MY OPINION and i dont want it to seem like i hate s22u , i kinda like it . i just dont think its worth buying .( especially compared to the s21u)
like there is a ton of people experiencing bugs on the phone. 
the proccesor and bettery arent as good as samsung advertised it and the tests show that . 
i never thought i would say this , but to be honest i think the iphone 13 pro max is a better buy this year . 
like the battery is insane on that thing .
the performance . its too good and it could make the phone last 5 years plus with apples ios optimizations .
also the speakers r better on the iphone ( thats the s pen's ""fault"")
the camera . while the camera is on par on both (except the zoom) , the iphone has way better low light photos and WAY better video (which i think is more inportant than zoom for most people).
like i dont really see a reason why you would buy the s22u . may for zoom ? thats valiable point but what more ?
if you really want android , u can just grab an a53 or just get a cheaper s22 and you almost have the same android expeience and  features (software wise) .
i mean you dont have to spend 1200 on a phone that barely better than s21u which you could by now for like 700.
dont forget that the iphone is 100$ less than the s22u.
in conclusion , i really think apple did it better this year. 
just dont forget , i dont wanna start a war .
this is all my opinion and i would love for you guys to say your opinion and give me reasons for you to buy the phone.
so ye :)"	N

S22 ultra unlocked not updating, has any Canadians received updates on their unlocked as 22 ultra?	"Does any Canadian user with Telus as their provider been able to receive any software updates on their brand new Samsung s22 ultra yet?
It's almost April and I purchased an unlocked device straight from Samsung experience store and I have no issues getting software updates normally but since getting the device before launch until now I haven't received a single update on this device. My tab S8 ultra already recieved software a update, since I purchased it.
I'm a little concerned as to why my s22 ultra isn't getting any software updates everything works perfectly fine I get serviced and everything is good there's no issues with the phone it's just that even when I manually check I'm not getting any updates has there been one that has been released for the unlocked s22 ultra for Canadian users/international Snapdragon variant?"

Worst service	I bought a new phone (Galaxy S22 Ultra). Yesterday I found out that Fedex cannot change my address or let me pick up the phone. They said Samsung have a restriction for my order. I called Samsung Service and they cannot change anything. They don't t let me change my address, pick up the phone at Fedex facility or provide me a specific time to be in home. Their solution is for me to stay at home and don't work that day, or return the phone. This is the worst purchase I've ever made.	N
Samsung Internet Browser Request - Darkmode Readability	I love using my phone in bed with all the lights off. When I do, I set the brightness to the lowest setting, turn on maximum eye comfort shield, and also maximum extra dim setting. Now, the issue is, most of the apps, I have good readability. But when I open the Samsung Internet Browser, it's just too dark. Keep in mind, I went into the setting for the browser and set the darkmode brightness to it's highest. It's still way too dark to actually read. Can you please work on giving us an option to increase the darkmode brightness for the browser even higher? Thanks!	N
Privacy (Location pinging in background)	This post is for those privacy conscience and aware of the insane data mining these companies do. r/privacy on Reddit is a great source for those wanting to dive into the rabbit hole of information about this.I'm privacy conscience with tech. I know how foolish I sound saying that and yet still using Google/Samsung. I, however, feel like I've taken as many significant steps to limit data mining as I can short of going to custom ROM territory.I obviously limit all "permissions" in the normie way and also run Blokada plus to just help take more control over things. I realized that Bluetooth is pinging my location every 1-3 minutes non stop. I can not revoke location access and unfortunately use Bluetooth on and off throughout the day so turning it off is not an option.Here's my question: I don't recall my last phone S8 (Android 10) pinging location for Bluetooth (I could be wrong). Those of you with older phones, can you confirm if this is a new thing or has it always been. If new, this could be a major drain on battery and needs to be patched.	N
S22 Ultra (mini) Review	Well it's only my second day with this phone and I've got all my data transferred. It was so much better than going from my S9 to S21. I really like this phone! The corners are less rounded and it just feels overall larger; I like that. Snapchat and Instagram are immediately better with the camera optimizations; supporting ultra wide and telephoto lenses!It's not completely perfect, I'm still seeing occasional delay when swiping home with gestures (also present on my S21, so this is a One UI bug). Overall performance isn't 'wowing' me. Hopefully with time we'll see this stuff improve.Last thing! The vibration motor is kinda disappointing. Sure I can now hear my phone buzz when it's on the couch, but not on a desk / countertop. They tried to take an Apple approach by making the pitch lower (go listen for yourself).If you have any version of the S21, I wouldn't say the upgrade is really worth it unless you want a few new gimmicks a little early. Supposedly the camera optimizations are coming to the S21's with One UI 4.1 but don't hold me to that. I'll be sure to post again soon! Glad to be apart of the S22 family.	N

S22	I am so disappointed with the galaxy S22 ultra specially with its expensive price comparing to the material used in it so it gets lots of scratches easily which is weird with gorilla glass 6 victus not to mention the weak camera comparing to other phones as Huawei p50 and iPhone 13 pro max in order to the poor battery considering it's 5000 MA that should last for 12 hours with the screen on instead of only 6 hours in best cases so that the iPhone 13 pro max with a battery of less than 5000 MA lasts longer than the galaxy S22 ultra in order to lots of malfunctions and of cours we all upset because there's no more headphones or cover or charger in the box which we have to buy and pay more money for it and by adding the total cost to the phone we'll pay a fortuneI really hope you will be forced to lower its price to 800$ only because this is what it worth	N

<subject: no subject> for MMS text messages	I've had Galaxy phones for over a decade, and would usually just keep my old sim card when I upgrade to a new phone. I'm not sure if that is what is causing this issue, but since I've upgraded to my S22 and decided to use the new sim card instead of just upcycling my old sim card, now whenever I receive a Multimedia message it ALWAYS has a <subject: no subject> line before every single text. Group chats are already annoying but this added unnecessary line of text is incredibly distracting and frustrating. I've called T-mobile and they can't do anything because this issue is specific to the Samsung Message app (pre-installed default) In my internet research I've found this incredibly annoying issue has been going on for years so I refuse to believe that Samsung hasn't come up with a solution for this issue yet! I tried clearing the cache in the app settings, I tried clearing the cache partition, I removed all other permissions from other messaging apps, nothing that was suggested from previous posts related to this issue has worked to resolve this. How do I remove the <subject: no subject> from MMS?	N

When Sky Blue is not Sky Blue	Ordered my S22 Ultra on February 20th , arrived today . Ordered Sky Blue but it is not sky blue . Definitely not going to deal with trying to return it and waiting 6-8 weeks for a new one to arrive , especially after hearing what some people are dealing with when it comes to Samsung customer service. Really not happy about this but its only a color I guess . See for yourself and tell me what you think , Grey , White , Silver ?	N
Are you having issues with your S22 Ultra?	Try wiping out the Cache. Sometimes, a hard reset works. But you need to remember your current email address, and password. You may also have a defective device. Try calling 611 and tell them your issue. They might warranty swap the phone out. Your phone could also have a bug issue..... Sometimes security patches could screw the phone until another security patch is coming out. But first, Try to wipe out your cache. Turn off your phone. Once the phone is off, hold down the up volume Button and power Button together for 10 to 15 seconds. Once you do that quickly remove your fingers off, and then a boot load screen pops up. With your volume buttons you can control up and down as it high lights the word. The power button acts as a select button. Once you see wipe Cache partition hit select and it'll wipe your cache. After that, go up to where it saids reboot phone. Click on it and let the phone reboot. I hope it helps those people with lag issues, with other things.	N
Tinny audio S22 Ultra	Hi, I recently switched from my Pixel 3a to an S22 Ultra. One thing I can't seem to hone in on is the tinny audio, and it feels like there is depth to it either.

So right away I am having to retrain myself on volume since before say level 50 would be quite loud. But on the 22 Ultra, at level 50 it's really low. Is this actually right or is my phone just messed up? Why does it go to 150? Is this a setting or something that can go back to normal? Like why have 150 instead of the normal 100 volume?	N

5g on s22 ultra	Hi - upgraded to s22 ultra phone. On my service on the top right, I don't see the usual. "5G" symbol and can't figure out if it's just not displayed or if it is jot using 5G.

S22 Ultra 1TB still no updates after 7 weeks	This is now starting to bother me. 7 weeks without updates or a date for when I will receive my phone from pre order on 9th Feb.I realise I must be completely crazy to give 1.5k of my money and then spend my own time trying to get answers and delivery dates. It's appalling how Samsung can get away with this. They really should be held accountable for not updating their customers. I know the world is in turmoil but surely an email update is not a problem!I am sick of getting cut off by customer services before getting through. They don't even have a proper complaint service and IF you do get through they can't give a date. What on earth is that about? They have millions of our money taking the mick.I know it will be an incredible device, but just to have set our expectations on delays I would have bought a laptop and a phone at a later stage. This will be the last phone I ever pre-order. By the time it's received I may have waited on the next release. Abysmal service.This is their forum...and they don't even read it! Says it all.	N

S22 ultra Preorder backordered	I have had my pre-ordered s22 ultra backordered then the backordered delivery date changed to a later date 5 times so far.I called Samsung but CS and escalations several times now but they have done nothing but offer lies each time. Nothing I've been told has happened so apparently Samsung is okay with their employees creating an image of mistrust and incapability for the Samsung mobile brand. I was even told they cannot take complaints those must be by mail only.I'm curious as they stated the phones are being sent out in queued order by purchase date if this is accurate please reply with any status and let's check this.My order date: Feb 17thOriginal Delivery date given in order: March 4Current status on March9: Delivery date of March 30Customer service can offer no assistance only a 50$ credit that I don't want because I have to spend it with SamsungBackorders should have been declared pre-purchase when they reached the end of available number to sell. Every other company can track quantity so how do you not have this ability Samsung?I'm filing now with BBB maybe they can spur delivery since CS can only offer more wasted time and frustration.	N

Help me understand	So I have a apple 11 which i considerto ne trash & I have a S22 Ultra please help me understand why my apple unlocks soon as it notices my face (eyes open) but my Galaxy hardly ever recognizes me & I added my face twice to try help make things better but come on Samsung it 2022...if you're not going to include a charging box like them can you at least make sure my phone knows who I am my hands aren't always available & Bixby only really ever recognizes the people on the TV who aren't talking to him.

Trade in value!	On launch day my Note 20 Ultra trade in value was $600 with $250 worth of credits. I choose a S22 Ultra Sky Blue 512gb. With the credits I choose a Galaxy watch 4 classic, for an extra $69. Delivery date was supposed to be 3/8.On 2/25 I checked again, now the Note 20U had a trade in value of $850 with no credits, storage upgrade for $100 for 512gb (no longer available, now $200)and a $100 Google Play gift card. No brainer, contacted Samsung they said I couldn't cancel the first order, because it was already sent to the fulfillment department (not true) I reordered the same phone, $414 w/o tax opposed to $647 w/o tax. Rather have the money in my pocket than credits for a watch I didn't really want. I was going to sell the watch to offset price of the phone. I was able to cancel the watch and got the refund for it.Called Samsung last week and they said they will cancel the first order, no problem. It's been a week, still no refund or confirmation of order cancelation.Sunday I get an email that the first order is delayed( see never sent to fulfillment center)Samsung has $1100 of my money and I have no idea when the the first order is going to ship to get that money back. 2nd order is supposed to come 4/8 , don't believe that.While I do love their products, customer service is terrible!

Please bring back MST and SD card support.	I had to return my s22 ultra coz no MST n SD Card support, these 2 features are missing and now i am using my old note 20 ultra back, hey samsung, i have been using your phones since Note 2, We all love your phone for a reason n now you cannot just cheaply copy iPhones like this n downgrade the phones 2021 n 2022 have your own standards and class, please bring back SD card or i might need to switch a phone which has it.Now talking abt MST, you are telling me that at the time of Covid, when wireless touch less payments is most useful and necessary, your bunch of so called smart people in your business meetingssat in room and decided to remove one of the most best feature on samsung phones? That to at time of this pandemic? Are u nuts? I am amused that this foolish idea have been discussed among your so called smart team and got approved. Pls bring back mst and SD card or you might end up losing loyal customers who have been with Samsung since decades.	N

With samsung allow oem unlocking for note 20 after s22 releases?	I've been trying and wanting to root my device since I bought it with the "note" line ending I want to ask the "samsung" developer team if they with reinstate oem unlocking for the US snapdragon version of the note series.Especially with older devices I rather risk no warranty then no updates or even unfavorable updates to my device. Bloat ware space being used for non used "features". Idk the last time I even used the side bar or even half the samsung software.It's cool to have the option to have stuff not a option to be forced this stuff.Honestly with a big name in the android market you should be allowing users to freely choose the features they want.He'll I miss having my clock in the center, or even changing my battery image and textRather then trying to throw more and more into a rom you should be adding them to the store and having the apps act like stock apps work.Make a extremely basic stock rom and allow it to be "created" by the user. So all the features added (auto correct and ect can then be downloaded as a "stock application"Almost like throwing a theme on a phone.	N

How much does it cost to make your own case?	"Well, I figure to asks the s22 owners since owning the newest highest end phone we're phone aficionados. 
I own a cell accessories business at a local market. It does okay but Amazon is taking over everything. 
So I was thinking about making my own case line. I don't mean like to compete with otterbox and such in brick and mortar store. That takes multi millions, but like having my own like that's similar to a Poetic or Supcase for example that's only sold on Amazon or on your own website. 
I know the actual production in China isn't a lot per case. It can be done for very cheap. The expensive part is having the mold made and the CAD of the cast that costs thousands. 
Heck, I buy TPU cases for as low as $2.50 from my distributors and sell them for 15. They probably buy it for .50 cents a piece.  
Like a Unicorn Beetle for our phones on Amazon I recall was $25 when it was released at pre order. They're probably paying .75 cents per case since its a bit more advanced and with a kickstand. 
I buy generic Defenders from my suppliers for 4 bucks and sell them for 20. 
The problem is on Amazon generic cases like the generic Defender go for like 12 bucks. If I had my own product line of my own design I could sell it for at least 20 like Poetic and Supcase does. 
Anyway, just wondering if someone familiar with CAD or molds and supply chain could chime in."	N

Mid April shipping. Law of physics tells me to cancel	"Still weeks away from my ship date. I'd really like to get the S22U with a big camera upgrade but the law of physics tells me to cancel. I'm currently close to 800GB of 1.5TB capacity in My N2U. Plenty of storage. But it will be cutting it close if I get the S22U with only 1TB. I could make it work. Problem isn't that I go over 1TB by next year's upgrade. It's that next year's phone will most likely be 1TB too. 1TB isnt enough in 2023. 
Anybody else using a lot of local storage?"	N

$250 credit for samsung mess up. Details below.	"1) So samsung messed up my sky blue order by canceling it without authorization. 
2) To compensate they promised the original $250 credit if I place another order with them, which I did for a white version of the same configuration. 
3) I also placed an order for a graphite color which was apparently coming sooner but it just lost its cancel button but the white one from #2 is still saying April 19th delivery
Question: can I ask samsung to give me the $250 credit for #3 which they don't have on file for the credit they promised on #2? Or should I just wait for my white #2 they have on file to get it as promised?

Some of my positive reactions on the S22 Ultra	"Can I just tell everyone how happy I am with the s22 Ultra?! 
I'm a tech junky for sure but I don't always jump to the next big thing. I am upgrading from a Note 10+ to the s22u sky blue 256gb snap dragon variant.
First impression was how I could feel the weight difference once I held it in my hand the first time, I don't forsee it being an issue moving forward and I wasn't sure I'd like the spen being mounted on the left instead of the right but I honestly think it is better being mounted on the left. (I'm right handed btw).
The biggest difference for me was the 120hz refresh rate! I've never owned a cell phone above 60hz but wow... I cant put into words how flowy and smooth the animations are, it's just incredible. 
It's only been a few days but I definitely think this device is a beast and definitely worth a look if your in the market for an upgrade. It's a Note in heart and looks, I think I will always gravitate towards the squared design with a curved screen and did I mention how incredible the color is?!

anyone know if the Note20 s pen would work with our s22U's?	Jw since the black s pen is so boring with the matte black finish. Doesn't really match my white s22U in anyway either aside from the clicker being the color of the frame. I've had my s22U since February 23rd and the matte black finish is already showing glossy streaks from where sliding it in &amp; out is causing it to wear. Overall this year the s pen almost feels like an afterthought for a device that it's literally integrated into. Kinda a bummer given in the past Samsung did some really nice finishes on them and they felt more sturdy with said finishes. I didn't even realize when I pre-ordered the White finish that the s pen didn't match. Idk why they only did the color match on the limited colors. It looks fine on my gfs Green finish since it's a darker phone overall, same with burgundy and black but with the White it literally looks like an aftermarket cheap stylus. Does anyone know if previous the gen Note20 s pen would work okay since the frame and build of the phone is essential the same?	N

On the fence getting Whitestone dome for my Ultra	"I'm getting grey hairs researching this over the past week and have huge troubles deciding. Getting my S22 Ultra in the mail on friday and I need to order my cases and possibly a screen protector today.
As almost everyone else I am thinking of getting the Whitestone dome glass, because it's the most protective and nice looking one. The reason I am still on the fence is that I've been reading posts about the screen not being as bright and flawless as without one (and that goes for all protectors I guess?), edges chipping after only a week, not as durable with the curved screen compared to other phones, and of course the fingerprint issue. That I am least worried about after reading alot about the fixes, I am more concerned about the protector not being so durable. The thing is pricy for me as I am located in Norway, alot more expensive than in the US (about $20 more, only available from one single online store, or from amazon/whitestone with import charges). I really want it to work well if i spend my money on it. I could use the warranty if buying from amazon or whitestone, but then I would have to wait a couple of weeks each time to get replacement shipped overseas.
I kinda feel the need to get a protector because I've had bad luck in the past with screen damage, and from what I understood this phone is really fragile, especially considering the curved edges. I never had a phone with that curved edge and I am sweating from only the thought of my clumsy ass handling this beauty. I will probably baby it like crazy, but I don't trust myself fully. My home insurance covers damaged phones, but I have like a $200 deductible so that's making me a bit anxious. My current phone is a Huawei P20 Pro that is badly scratched up after many years being protector-less in a flip case, and I feel a bit uneasy about letting the Ultra end up like that too. I would honestly like to continue without protector, but I'm not sure if I dare to. I heard that the Gorilla glass victus scratches pretty easily, how bad is it?
I would like to hear from people that had Whitestone on for like 3+ weeks, but I will appreciate all answers and general thoughts. Does it seem to hold up? Also I would not mind hearing more stories from people that decided on no protector at all. Thanks for reading this long and have a nice day!
**EDIT:** I am also concerned about the glue taking away the oleophobic coating underneath If I were to regret putting it on. Read alot of conflicting posts about this and don't know what to believe. I know it wears away after some time but I really want the screen to be ""factory new"" with coating  still 100% after removal. Is a plastic film/TPU safer in this regard? Thoughts/facts about this is highly appreciated.
**TLDR; I really can't decide on getting the Whitestone dome glass or going naked. Concerned about the durability with S22 Ultras curved edge, also the rumor about original oleophobic coating possibly coming off with the glue. Please help!**"	N

My s22 ultra together with my galaxy watch did something Amazing	"I experienced something very astonishing that I've never experienced before with my galaxy watch. I have the galaxy watch classic from 2018 (Bluetooth and wifi only, no LTE) and I recently bought an s22 ultra. A couple of days ago I forgot my phone in the car in the basement parking and I was looking for it all over the house. I was pretty sure the phone was inside the house as my watch was still connected to it and I was getting all the modifications and calls on the watch. It wasn't until a little later that I went back to the car to realise that I forgot the phone there. Now the interesting part is that I live on the 16th floor in a fairly populated apartment complex. There were 17 floors of concrete and countless number of interfering signals between the phone and the watch and the it still somehow managed to stay connected to the phone, which is very weird to me. 
Is this a common occurrence or does anyone have a possible explanation for it? And again, i'm very impressed"	N

I abandoned the idea of ​​improving autonomy because I can't find a solution.  
But, what is worse than the autonomy, is the permanent stutter on this phone.
The applications are slow, the menus are slow, the change of window is not fluid, not worthy of a phone at 1200 €.  
After a lot of tests, I have the impression that switching to FHD instead of QWHD has clearly improved the fluidity of the phone (still at 120hz).  
People who encounter stutter problems have already had the same feeling that the WQHD is currently poorly managed by the phone?
Also, I set the Ram Plus to 8Gb, but not sure if it improve something or not."	N
Exynos - Camera issues	"Hi,
I've had the S22 Ultra for around a month now and so far so good, apart from one pretty annoying bug. 
For reference I have the 256gb + 12gb S22 Ultra Exynos.
In mid to low light situations, pretty much anything which isn't daylight for the first 5 to 10 seconds the camera has a major stutter and lag almost as if it was recording in 5fps, it then seems to sort its self out. I've noticed this is worst on the main lens.
Is anyone else suffering from the same issue? I know of one other person."	N
Camera Tips?	Other than point and click, I don't know anything about all the features the wonderful camera on this phone offers. Does anyone know of a tutorial that breaks down the features and when to use what mode, zoom, etc.?	N

Navigation gestures stutter (weird) fix	"Exynos here, my device is running super smooth and like it a lot. The only thing that bothered me is the small stutter/jitter when going home or when you open recent apps 
I tried to put those guys to unrestricted inside the battery section but didn't help.
The weird fix was to install one hand operation + and set the home screen grid to 5X6 
Now I'm not seeing the stutter anymore. 
If you have some stutter so try it out and see if it makes a difference.
Hope this helps"	N
Anyone's trade-ins denied?	"Both my note 20 ultra and my s8+ were denied and Samsung is asking for $725 additional. Stated conditioned was 100% accurate and devices were wiped. Support is unwilling to help but extended the return window.
Samsung is sending back the two phones and I guess I'll return it. Can't say I'm impressed with the battery drain for the S22 Ultra, but otherwise it's a great phone. Guess I'm back to the pixel for now. Enjoy your phones everybody, I'll miss mine, but I think this is the final nail in the coffin for Samsung for me."	N

Thanks"	N
for those who still struggling the battery drainage thing	"i suggest a method that can narrow down the range of suspects. battery consumption = foreground usage + background usage. your daily battery stat mixes them up. there is a good chance you can have your phone idled for sufficiently long period to get the background stat: during your sleep. the statistics start counting from 00:00 so you had better stop using your phone and go to bed before that time. then you wake up after 8 hours or something you capture the battery stat. you can see if something was eating up the battery when your phone was idle
https://i.imgur.com/BGQlZhC.jpg
as for my case i found no suspect at all. only 3 apps running in background and used up negligible amount of battery. if this is not your case you should easily spot those battery eating apps and you can take action accordingly. hope this can help you"	N

Freebies received but phone being sent back	I ordered my red S22 Ultra when it first went up for sale and it or course was sent late. I contacted Samsung several times about being concerned that they don't ship it during a two week period where I will be out of the country. They promised it wouldn't happen, and of course it did. I have tried multiple calls to Samsung and FedEx, even had Samsung call FedEx, but in the end I was informed by FedEx that Samsung's account prevents even Samsung from changing my shipping instructions to permitting a vacation hold. I was informed my phone will be returned tomorrow after the third delivery attempt. FedEx won't deliver to a neighbor or use the luxor locker system our complex has for the package. They did however drop off the box with my free ear buds and other promotional accessories. So tomorrow after my phone gets returned, what happens with the freebies they sent me? I'm rather annoyed they won't accommodate me and just hold the stupid phone until I return, I mean.. i paid for it, its mine, and I won't be able to get this price or promotion again. I also have no intention of waiting months for the special color either. I'm done with them if they send it back.	N

HEIC vs JPG	"So the theory goes that HEIC, a more modern codec for images than JPG is more efficient and results in images of the same quality for about half the filesize of the same image as JPG.
&amp;#x200B;
So one of the first things I ddid when I got my phone is turn on HEIC image saving inthe camera app.
So far it looks like HEIC is about twice the size of JPG images, so whats going on? Is it saving different additional image data in the container, or is it lossless compression as opposed to lossy JPG.  
Quite a technical question I know, but I like to store my photos in the best quality for best use of storage."	N

My s22 ultra together with my galaxy watch did something Amazing	"I experienced something very astonishing that I've never experienced before with my galaxy watch. I have the galaxy watch classic from 2018 (Bluetooth and wifi only, no LTE) and I recently bought an s22 ultra. A couple of days ago I forgot my phone in the car in the basement parking and I was looking for it all over the house. I was pretty sure the phone was inside the house as my watch was still connected to it and I was getting all the modifications and calls on the watch. It wasn't until a little later that I went back to the car to realise that I forgot the phone there. Now the interesting part is that I live on the 16th floor in a fairly populated apartment complex. There were 17 floors of concrete and countless number of interfering signals between the phone and the watch and the it still somehow managed to stay connected to the phone, which is very weird to me. 
Is this a common occurrence or does anyone have a possible explanation for it? And again, i'm very impressed"	N

S22 Ultra average screen on time for different users?	Would like to hear from others out there with the S22 Ultra and their experiences with battery life.

S22 Ultra 2 week Impressions	"&amp;#x200B;
From Note 8 to s22 u:
Things I love:
* Amazing Vivid Display, Very quick and smooth even in 60hz. 120hz makes it even better!
* Battery Life is much better than Note 8. Getting avg 7hr sot. 3.5hrs if playing games.
* Jaw-Dropping Camera and Zoom. No idea i was missing out on so many new modes and features.
* One Ui 4.1 is just great. As a note 8 user, I've only experienced the original one ui and was extremely frustrated when one ui 2.0 was getting so many new and awesome features like the not-halfbaked navigation gestures, new good lock and dex features, more complete your phone integration etc. It almost made me want to abandon samsung for only getting 2 updates but thankfully now i have all that plus 4 more OS upgrades.
* New March Update made performance even better and thermals after cooler as well.
* Expert Raw, Bixby Routines and Good Guardian Modules on oneui 4.1 are make this already awesome device more versatile and take better photos.
Things that i find bad/ need improved:
* I think the camera focus is not the best and i've messed up shots because of the delay. It also doesn't help that with the phone being wider than the note 8, i could barely take pictures with one hand(I also have large hands). This could be fixed with pro mode but still my note 8 can do better on auto i feel with focus.
* The Sound and Vibration on this thing is a bit low and i'm concerned i might miss notifications
* Also no notification led ( third party software can help but i don't want to use them) which i miss the most from my note 8.
* No heart rate sensor is also a bit disappointing but i have an active 2 now so its manageable. No Headphone jack is surprisingly easy to let go of.
* I expected more stable wifi with the new wifi 6 on it but unfortunately the stability is not that good especially when playing certain games. I'd probably assume a software patch will fix it but so far march update hasn't done that. Changing some wifi settings to static from dhcp helps a bit too.
* The Battery is better than the note 8 but I'm a tad bit dissatisfied with it. I expected the change from 3300 to 5000 mah to be a bit more but i guess 120hz does put a strain on battery.
Overall, I'm very happy with the upgrade. Hopefully a software patch will fix some of the more annoying issues like with the wifi."	N
Samsung S22 U exynos	"Beware of the exynos variant of S22U
A week ago I bought the Samsung S22 Ultra (exynos) and I must say that I'm very disappointed.
* UI stopped responding a few times required me force reboot the device.
* Battery drains fast for no reason.
* It couldn't handle a video call while gaming heartstone. Made the game lag.
* Also had some problems with pictures processing.
* Some apps has issues, don't know if it's Android 12 or exynos thing.
It's clearly rushed to market and that's why we didn't see any exynos numbers before release.
Hopefully Samsung will patch phone soon or I'll might return it back. So just beware about exynos variant."	N

Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra shipping delays and lying customer support	I pre-ordered my Samsung Galaxy Ultra February 24th and was told that my phone would be delivered March 20th (it's on my original receipt that was emailed to me), I then logged in a few days later and it said it was pushed back to March 25th; No problem, I thought. I logged in a few days later to my account and then it showed it was pushed back to April 20th.I was upset so I contacted customer service and they told me to disregard that message, it is just a generic message that is global and that my phone will be sent out March 25th and delivered March 26th. They gave me $50 Samsung Promo code (still haven't received it at the time of writing this).March 25th comes and I haven't received any notification but I thought, maybe they will send it the next day. Nope, I got an email saying my phone was delayed for OVER 30 days. Angry, I contacted support again and they said that my phone will be shipping out and that I should disregard that email. They gave me another $100 Samsung Promo code (I still haven't received that one either).A few days later, March 29th, I contacted support again and they said that there was a huge demand for pre-order and that product was backed up and they are very sorry for the inconvenience. They said that they will make my order priority but they don't know when it will come in or when it will ship out but the computer says March 25th and here is another $50 Samsung Promo.So here are the points that I want to make:Samsung either has no idea how a pre-order sale works or just has terrible software to control product inventory. A pre-order is a reservation that holds am item for the purchaser. Think about a movie ticket, you purchase a movie ticket and the theater reserves your seat, they don't sell your seat to other people and be first come first serve. When I pre-ordered the phone, I was given a special number that is associated to my product telling their software that this is the phone that is needed for this person. Yet, I do not have a phone BUT I can go to the Samsung website right now and literally purchase the same phone and have it delivered next day. (see photo)If it is the case that their intranet or company system cannot handle the computation of inventory and warehouse delivery, then that is worrying considered it is a multinational consumer electronic corporation. A high school student with limited knowledge in Python can make a better system in 4 hours.Samsung may not understand how supply chains work. I was told the that warehouse handling my order has run out of my specific phone (somehow; see first point) and is waiting for resupply. Again, how does that happen? IF they have a company system handling inventory, there should be no excuse for delay of products from a pre-order. The only thing that would happen is the program would flag the issue and move the fulfillment to another warehouse that has product. Amazon does this probably every minute, if not second, for users. This should not be a difficult project, especially for a company as big as Samsung that creates their own software. If this is how they handle supply chains and pre-orders, I would hate to be part of that company if there is an issue with my paycheck.The customer service representatives are liars. I was told three times that my phone would be shipped March 25th and two times I was told days after the March 25th date. I was told that it was impossible for them to prioritize my phone for shipping, that I was in a queue to get the phone that I paid for over a month ago and received barely any updates on, but they were very sorry and will prioritize the shipping....🤔 I was told that I would get a combined $200 worth of Samsung bucks for my trouble of being lied to so often, but that too was a lie.Really, at this point, I don't see myself using Samsung products ever again, and I know they don't care because I am just one person, oh well, boo hoo. But after all the bad press about the throttling of their phones, the lack of transparency in products, and being kicked off of product reviews, it probably wouldn't be a positive if other customers are getting treated this way and the media gets hold of it. So, I don't even want those Samsung bucks because I won't be shopping Samsung ever again after what is happening and I am considering possibly just cancelling my order and waiting for the Google Pixel 7 pro to drop or just trading in the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra for it. This whole experience has left a really bad taste in my mouth regarding Samsung, their business structure, and how they treat customers.	N

Charged Final Payment on old phone	I get my phones through the Samsung Upgrade Program and have upgraded recently from the S20 Ultra to the S22 Ultra.I Pre-ordered the S22 Ultra and returned my S20 Ultra using the Upgrade Program return packaging.Yesterday, I was charged the final payment of £239.83 by Klarna for my old S20 Ultra which I had already returned.I've spent a whole day on the phone to support being led through different departments with no success - Just responses pushing me away with we'll get back to you over email with a response but nothing.If this was the other way around and I owed Samsung or Klarna money it would be a whole different story and I wouldn't be allowed to just push them away and ignore it.Has anyone else had this issue before? During the return process, Klarna paused the payments so clearly Samsung had not notified them that the item was received and the payments continued.I'd just like the money refunded as they've practically stole the phone as I've payed in full for this and returned it.It would've been easier to pay the final payment to just sell the phone myself instead of returning it as I know I can get a lot more than£239.83 for the phone.

It just feels weird, for the first time I have to adjust how I use my phone. I understand why Samsung made the move, I have no complaints as we've been SPOILED for years and it was just a matter of time. 
They could've milked us for even more, like Apple with their storage options but they didn't by offering 256GB for the price of 128GB. Sure, you can say it's marketing... 
Hopefully, they continue this for the Z Flip4.  
Like I always say, IT'S BUSINESS DON'T TAKE IT PERSONAL. 
BTW, I still blame Apple for this. LOL"	N
Free YouTube subscription	One of the free promotions when I pre-ordered my S22 was 4 free months of YouTube Premium. Does anyone know how to redeem it?	N
Who bought the S22 Plus?	"I bought the middle child of the series, the S22 plus 256gb in green.  
Mainly because I have the S21 Ultra and wanted the flat screen and because I also bought the Tab S8. I will be selling the S21. I probably would have ordered the S22 if it had a bigger battery. Phone screens are just too small for consuming content and reading on a lot. I also can't remember the last time I took advantage of the extra features on the Ultra. I'm glad that there aren't too many compromises on the Plus.  
Who else ordered one?"	N
Status Bar Clock	Is there a way to remove the little digital clock on the far left of the status bar of home screens where notifications belong? I am using Nova Prime in case that matters.	N
Icon packs applied using Theme Park is Next-Level	"I used to be happy and content when using Nova to apply a custom icon pack. Then I inadvertently decided to try applying the same icon pack using Theme Park instead, and I was more than plesantly surprised. 
Nova could only theme the icons within the launcher itself, whereas Theme Park themed icons in most other parts of the GUI (screenshots provided): 
Lock Screen shortcuts
Open With menu
Edge Apps (Panel)
Galaxy Watch notifications
Windows ""Your Phone"" app 
I'll next be looking to theme the Quick Panel icons properly, but in the meantime, this is great!"	N

Won't connect at all. Would prefer not to do a factory reset as it took ages to get it the way I like it. Pretty annoying because I don't even use it but for a phone over 1k you'd want it to work. Also battery life is shite enough and my GPS won't work sometimes. I guess I'm the exynos as I'm in Europe. Pretty pissed off was looking forward to getting back to Samsung after OnePlus.

Buyers beware! S22 Ultra current issue list	"So after having my phone for about a month now, I'd like to share main confirmed issues with it:  
**Exynos model!!!**  
1. **Battery life** \- I've waited all the time and initial 2 weeks(can't return phone because of that) to get my battery ""optimized"". Nothing changed, if anything - I think its even worse now. And don't get me even started on Stand By battery drain.
2. **Finger print/ UI freeze** \- Sometimes phone is just frozen on lock screen. And to solve this you need to spam all side buttons for about 10 seconds for it to respond. Sometimes this happens even 3 times in a row, super super annoying. (This happens every day)
3. **Audio/ Video sync issues** \- occasionally phone bugs out and video is behind the audio. So whatever you will try to watch, lets say Youtube, you will see thing happen in a video and later audio will come.
4. **Multitasking lag/ heat** \- I have encountered heat and lag issues multiple times. For example I was having a 30 minute call on WhatsApp and my phone had trouble dealing with other app opening and using menu. Everything was laggy and choppy, not responsive.
5. **Sound** \- Probably many of you already watched reviews and one thing that stands out is the sound quality. This is not particularly a big issue, but sound quality is pretty terrible. Even compared to my almost 4 y/o iPhone XR, this thing really doesn't produce quality sound.
These issues are found not only by me, but are all around web, people are reporting it on Samsung website, reddit and so on. I don't know if Snapdragon users are experiencing these, but again this is about Exynos model.
This is not a hate post or a rant post. I just want to reach buyers at this moment and show them what they will potentially be dealing with. For a phone that costs this much - I think its unacceptable. You can buy a 300 euro Xiaomi phone and it will be miles better. Of course camera won't be as good, but apart from that - you will not be losing much. I bought this phone because I wanted to experience ultimate android Flagship, which was suppose to be the best, but in the end I think I've made a bad decision.
Hope some of you will find this helpful.
Cheers!"	N

S22 Ultra Heating	(I am using Exynos variant) Is it normal for the phone to heat up so much after using the camera for 2 minutes? I took 2 normal photos and a 100x zoom one and the top left area on the back was extremely hot to the touch. Is my phone defective? What should I do?	N
How long do I keep app open to avoid screen burn?	S22U screen is gorgeous. What time out would you suggest to avoid screen burn in? For example google maps or tik tok have white icons that will burn in after longer use. Would you say 15min at a time is ok?	N

4. Brighter Display

GSM Issue - Call drops / bad quality calls	"Hi s22u (Exynos) fam,
I'm here writing you about an issue I'm experiencing with my device while calling.
When I receive calls, sometimes the phone doesn't ring and I receive directly a notification of lost call instead.
On the other side, when I call somebody, it occurs that the call quits suddenly as the signal drops to zero for less than a second.
In both cases I hear the person i'm talking to very bad, with high and low pitch noises, like the network is disrupted. 
I wrote to Samsung, they told me to reboot in safe mode, to reset connection settings and try to swap sim cards with other providers, but nothing changed. They told me that they know about that issue and will be solved hopefully in the next update, but I use mainly the phone for calling and for me it's frustrating to have that problem.
Does someone here have the same problem and has anyone solved it temporarily by changing some settings while waiting for the next update?
Many thanks to everyone"	N

S22Ultra and TikTok Filters	"This might be a stupid post here but I've seen a few people looking for this answer and... zero answers.

BEFORE clearing data, post any drafts you have, or post them to private. You can download a tiktok watermark remover but it needs a link so the video must be posted. This will log you out of your account. 
After that soft reset your phone: hold power and volume down button until Samsung logo appears (approximately 45 seconds) device will restart, filters will be usable."	N

A review of the best clear cases with kickstands..	"What better way to show off the cool S22 colors than with a clear case? And a handy kickstand for your video viewing pleasure. I know this is a very niche area but I thought I'd put it up for discussion for anyone else looking for this. I spent hours trying to decide and watched a bunch of youtube videos for comparison on these, to see what the best option was for me. I narrowed it down to the 4 below with my personal opinion:
1. [Samsung](https://www.amazon.com/Electronics-Protective-Protection-Transparent-EF-JS908CTEGUS/dp/B09NB6R7VW/ref=sr_1_14?crid=C6AFW6VG24K2&amp;keywords=clear+case+kickstand+s22+ultra+samsung&amp;qid=1648594059&amp;sprefix=cleare+case+kickstand+s22+ultra+samsun%2Caps%2C135&amp;sr=8-14) - Can't go wrong with a case from the actual phone manufacturer. What I love about this case is that it doesn't have a big square or P-shape cutout for the cameras. It has cutouts for each specific lens which I think is the most ideal layout. The only thing that pushed me away from it was that the kickstand is significantly thicker than other cases. While it may come with increased sturdiness, I think that a slightly thinner one would work just fine. In addition, the kickstand has ""SAMSUNG"" stamped across the middle which honestly feels like I'd be a walking advertisement.
2. [Spigen Ultra Hybrid S](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Ultra-Hybrid-Designed-Galaxy/dp/B09JFNW8KZ/ref=sr_1_5?crid=2I2NZKIKU7O5P&amp;keywords=clear+case+kickstand+s22+ultra&amp;qid=1648593913&amp;sprefix=cleare+case+kickstand+s22+ultr%2Caps%2C115&amp;sr=8-5) - Normally, I would automatically get the Spigen. I've been getting Spigen cases for years now and they are among the best in quality and durability. However, this particular case, uses a magnetically powered kickstand. The reviews on Amazon (sort by most recent) talk about how this interferes with the S-Pen, as well as various people who said it had broken fairly quickly.  I decided not to go with Spigen this time around, at least for this type of case. The kickstand also has a small Spigen logo in the middle and it is a little more discrete, which is nice. 
3. [Torras MoonClimber](https://www.amazon.com/TORRAS-MoonClimber-Armor-Level-Shockproof-Protective/dp/B09K7ZWTT4/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=2I2NZKIKU7O5P&amp;keywords=clear+case+kickstand+s22+ultra&amp;qid=1648593913&amp;sprefix=cleare+case+kickstand+s22+ultr%2Caps%2C115&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyUUdEWUMwUktZSzZNJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwOTc4OTc2MlpXV1JZMjIwRUpaTSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMzMwNTM4QkIzR1NRREpJRlE2JndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==) - this was the sponsored option at the top on Amazon and normally I'm a little wary when things are sponsored. However, this case had great reviews. One of the few bad reviews I saw was due to it not fitting right with a lens protector, which seems a bit unreasonable that they expect them to design it with other manufacturer's lens protectors in mind. Like Samsung, this kickstand has the Torras logo stamped across for free Torras advertisement. 
4. [ESR Metal Kickstand](https://www.amazon.com/ESR-Samsung-S22-Ultra-Scratch-Resistant/dp/B09LCQ3MC7/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2I2NZKIKU7O5P&amp;keywords=clear%2Bcase%2Bkickstand%2Bs22%2Bultra&amp;qid=1648593913&amp;sprefix=cleare%2Bcase%2Bkickstand%2Bs22%2Bultr%2Caps%2C115&amp;sr=8-3&amp;th=1) - This case had the most reviews of all 4 I've listed. It is very similar to Torras. They are almost identical from the lens cutouts to the kickstand. One difference is the ESR lens cutout has ""Camera Guard"" in very small letters. In addition, as one review pointed out, the kickstand opens the wrong way. Meaning, setting it in landscape mode meant the volume buttons would be facing down. However, this isn't as big of a deal as it seems due to the kickstand being VERY stiff, you can flip the phone over and the kickstand will still hold just fine. 
In the end it comes down to personal preference. I ended up choosing the ESR case due to the number of reviews which were mostly positive and the simple, yet, very good kickstand with no company advertisement. Even if it opens the wrong way. Ideally I would have wanted a case with the lens cut outs that Samsung has, the simple and very stiff kickstand that ESR has (but that opens the right way), and the reliability of Spigen. 
And these were my 2 cents.."	N

Has Samsung always used this diagonal arrow on the top right corner?   Anyways... That's minor compared to battery life and thermals.  Yes there are ways to optimize, but I didn't pay all that money to cut back on features.

I've had the S22 for a month now. The battery life hasn't really improved.	"I switched from an iPhone XS that had a lot of modem issues and I realized that Android fixed most of the issues I had with iOS after doing quite a lot of asking around. However, one thing I cannot comprehend is just how appallingly short the battery life is on my S22. I've read that having a poor cellular signal can be attributed here (and I work in an area with horrific cellular service for every carrier, including Verizon, who I use) and I'm getting maybe 3 hours of SoT. When at home on WiFi I can get around 5. 
My 3-and-a-bit-year old iPhone XS never reached 50% battery during my day-to-day where I'd snap photos, edit them in Lightroom, upload them, browse IG/YouTube/Snapchat/Reddit and regularly plug in at work for CarPlay. My S22, if I weren't working a job that allows me to plug my phone in as regularly as I get to, would not last me an entire day. I traded the iPhone in with 89% battery health. I am certain it did better on battery by a longshot. It didn't receive 5G, which probably contributes to its long battery life, to be fair. 
With that said, I still really like this phone, even if typing this up erased about 3% of my battery. The size is great, the display is awesome, USB-C is so much better than Lightning in every way, this phone actually gets cellular service where my old phone wouldn't, Vanced is great (RIP), sideloaded apps are cool, my AirPods Pros work 90% as well as they did on iOS, I don't have to deal with notifications about my iCloud storage being full, Google Maps and Waze both work much better, universal back button, man the list goes on. I'm just disappointed that a new phone in 2022 gets worse battery life than my used phone from 2018. 
I still would recommend this phone to anybody who, like me, puts battery life is item 6 or 7 on the ""must have in a phone"" list."	N
Bixby Routines for AndroidAuto	"Does anyone have any idea how to set up Bixby routines that affect Android auto? 
I have a routine that keeps my GPS disabled unless I have a select few apps active on my screen. https://i.imgur.com/N6SSUMc.jpg
Unfortunately this causes AA to fail all the time since my phone turns off gps as soon as the screen goes off. I haven't been able to find Android auto in the Bixby settings and was wondering if anyone had any ideas of how to solve this?

It's bigger.  Screen is pretty.  But I'm just not feeling like I've made some grand leap into the future of technology and gotten a big QOL boost.   Maybe I'll enjoy it more as time goes on but just not real happy with it so far.  Feel like I should've just kept the S10+ but the battery in it was going down.
Also this Green color is hardly what is call green."	N
S21/S22 Camera question	Hi, I've been wanting to ask for the longest time now about the cameras, I've heard lots and lots of people claim that, Well, the cameras will improve over time with updates and such, But, I never actually saw a comparison of a phone's camera before and after said updates, So, Does the camera get better? Is there a video to show the difference? Have you noticed it getting better yourself?	N
S21+ vs S22+. Which one to pick if they were both the same price?	So basically Samsung is gonna replace my s21+ becuase it was shutting down constantly during usage. They are offering me a S22+ free of charge. Spec-wise S21+ looks better on the paper with bigger battery, screen etc. Only upsides are the processor and the faster charging speed. I really don't know which one to pick. It would be nice If some of you guys have hands-on experince for both of them that can give some feedback	N
Basic question - Flip 3 vs S22+	"Hey guys,   
Kinda basic question but I  am agonizing for a couple of days and I need somebody to decide for me. My old OnePlus 7T is dying and I really need to replace it in near future.   
I am not super power user but I spent quite a while browsing the net, reading and listening to music on Spotify on my phone. I am also into street photography and I don't always have my dslr on hand.   
Youtube not often and usually near the charger and I do not play mobile games.
First I was looking at S22 ultra however for me it was just too ugly and not nice to hold. I am not amazed by S22+ (looks better than Ultra but it's just lack smth), however it seems like most rational choice and its 160 euro cheaper for me because of old phone buyback.   
Although there is something in flip that I really want it. The flex functionality would be amazing for me for zoom meeting and it just looks amazing. As right now I would get Galaxy Watch 4 and headphones for free.   
The only thing that really scares me is the battery and the camera. I travel a lot and the last thing that I want to do in a new city is hunt for a wallplug.   
So could somebody help me, because tbh for couple of days I saw so many different opinions that I do not know what to think anymore :P"	N
Upgraded to S22 from an S9 and I'm kind of disappointed...	Is anyone else experiencing video de-sync issues? I keep having to restart my phone everytime it happens, and I literally have to do this a lot to get the video back to sync. Does anyone have a permanent solution to this?	N
Upgrade to S22U or Z Fold 3?	"Hello guys,
I'm thinking of upgrading my old Note 10+ but I'm torn between the S22U or the Z Fold 3.
My reasons to get the S22U is the better battery life and better camera quality, while the Z Fold 3 on the other hand has the best looking screen, better for emulating/gaming and best for productivity..
Which do you guys think is worth it?

Samsung S10e, S21e, S22e?	Do you think Samsung will ever release a 5.8 inch screen with the above mentioned flagships? Currently on a S10e, tablets don't fit in my pocket. I'd pay 2 grand for a 5.8 inch S22e..is this a pipe dream to expect smaller versions of their newer flagships?	N
S22 Ultra AmFilm issues?	"I recently put on the AMfilm glass protector for my S22 Ultra. Putting it on was easy enough, but I'm noticing the blacks aren't as black as they used to be. When comparing it to the black where my front camera is, they look grayish.

Which s22 ultra version should I get?	"Should I get exynos vs snapdragon. Going to Hong Kong in a week and have the option to pick either exynos or Snapdragon upgrading from my s10.  Is there a general consensus on which is better or they about the same.

Updates for my S22 ultra I bought	I ordered a green Samsung S22 ultra on March 18th. Originally it was backorder (because of the high volume of orders and pre orders) BUT it also said it would ship the week of March 23. And I didn't mind the wait said it'd be delivered April 12th (estimated) and today it updated its shipped and will be here (hopefully) this Thursday from what it said. My only gripe is it's being delivered from FedEx. But they want the trade in device sent through USPS, which is MUCH quicker (IMPO) can't electronically sign for the pack through FedEx as you can with USPS. The point is, patience is key when waiting for something like this. And you know what it paid off. I understand the excitement of getting it when ordered and other issues that may have occurred but any galaxy phone I've ever had since the S3. I've never had any issues with any of them especially as old as the previous models were and how many updates and such they've had. I'm excited to receive my new S22 ultra and whatever happens from there will be taken care and fixed along the way.	N

Does the Samsung 15 Watt Adapter not support Fast Wireless Charging?	I have a S22, plugging it into my SamsungTravel Adapter EP-TA200 works fine for fast charging via a USB cable. It even says "Adaptive Fast Charging" on the adapter and is rated at 15 wattsBut when I use a wireless Belkin 10W charging pad that is compatible/rated for Samsung 9W Fast Charging, it does not fast charge wirelessly. I dont think this has anything to do with Belkin, it supports fast wireless charging. And I tried a different brand wireless charging pad, no luck either.So is it the adapter?

Anyone know a solution to this? I found that there is no way to disable Samsung keyboard either.	N
Disable Samsung-skinned Google Messages	I've been using Google Messages for years and just got my S22 Ultra and found out Samsung has added their own skin to Google Messages. I'd love to have a way to disable this because I do not like it. Between the colors and functionality, I much prefer the standard Google Messages app over the Samsung-skinned app.It's even missing features. Like on Google Messages, an iPhone user can react to a text and it'll show the corresponding emoji. On the Samsung-skinned Messages, it sends the standard text saying they reacted. It also doesn't include the option to send higher resolution photos with Google Photos.I also just prefer the feel of Google Messages better and would much prefer it. Please, allow us to choose which version of Messages we use.	N
Galaxy S22 Speaker Distortion and Crackling	If you are having speaker crackling coming from both speakers and you're within your return window, RETURN YOUR PHONE and buy a new one. Hopefully you get one from a new batch that was built right.Info only:I pre-ordered early and got my s22 around Feb 23rd. In colder weather, playing any audio through the speakers sounds like they're blown out. Sounds terrible. Some other members have the same problem and said that pressing down on the screen firmly would make it sound normal. As soon as pressure is removed, it goes back to crackling. In warm weather, speakers are fine.After calling Samsung support 4 different times, they came up with no solutions except to send the phone in for evaluation and repair. I told them that it's my only phone and I'm not wanting a "repaired" device but a new one. Repaired devices are never as good as factory originals and since I keep my phone's for 3+ yrs, I need one that's gonna last like my s8 active did.It's unacceptable that after spending so much money on a flagship product, we receive something that fails quality control. I'm still within my 15 day return window and will be sending it back. Already purchased a replacement myself hoping its from a different batch.	N
S22 ultra $250 credit	Just tried to use my credit on a couple of portable SSDs and it says invalid items.

N
My Ultra model number wrong country?	So I noticed I couldn't register my phone with its model number with the samsung member app because of an error. I tried looking up manuals to find my correct model number because I was probably looking in the wrong place.It turns out I was looking in the right place? My model number didn't show up on any of the possible US model numbers on the samsung website because, when googling it I'm sent to the latin samsung website which has my model number.So it turns out my phone is latin. That's cool and all but I can't register my device to my account. What other compatibility things should I check for? It's been past 15 days but should I bother swapping out? Do I actually have a exynos phone and not the snapdragon one? It's weird because my firmware update was delayed with the same timing as everyone else on this version of samsung members.	N

45W Super Fast Charging 2.0 Chargers	"So I'm making this thread to hopefully create a list of verified chargers that actually support Super Fast Charging 2.0. 
Many people may not know that there is a 2.0. You can only achieve the 2.0 standard with a 45W+ PPS charger that outputs 5A AND a cord that also supports 5A. The cords that come with the phones only support 3A. So no matter how powerful the charger it won't initiate 2.0 without a 5A cable. 
I personally don't have one yet but if you do please chime in here 
Of course the Samsung official 45W charger and cord work but mostly I'm looking for Amazon alternatives.... 
I just ordered this one as I've read it works... Will update when it arrives

I feel like I got scammed with exynos	Almost all the reviews on youtube saying the camera, performance and battery is very good yet they are in Usa and have snapdragon variants. It is like samsung is doing it intentionally and you can't find any popular youtuber reviewing exynos. They are like 2 different phones having similar yet so different specs. Camera, performance and battery all seems worse for exynos and it is much worse than last year's difference. If you can't offer similar performance what is the point naming them same?	N

Common issue? 3xs22 ultras freezing randomly when opening apps	"So I was the first of my friends with an s22 ultra. I noticed right away that randomly when opening apps eg messenger, outlook, Facebook, even the camera app...the phone locks up for 3-5 seconds before it can load the app, doesn't respond to any button presses until it finishes it's lock up...
I was fearful it was just mine...then 2 of my friends got s22 ultra also and confirmed it happens to them too. That's 3 phones now same issue.
Very annoying. Anyone else have this? Has Samsung acknowledged it or know about it?

Horrible buying experience on Samsung ending with me initiating return	"I placed pre-order for 1TB Red on Feb 9 using Samsung shop app. It gave me $250 credit (vs $200 for pre-order via website). I selected ""The Essentials Bundle"" which was available then for $225. It consisted of SView Flip cover, Buds Pro, Smart Tag and Wireless charger Duo withbTA. I took screenshots all the way except the last screen after placing order. Order confirmation email received showed no bundle but accessories separately and each one was charged, no credits applied, it was missing the instant rebate of $100 for phone and wireless charger was also missing. Total cost $2035.
Contacted Samsung customer care on Feb 10 when I checked the email. They reviewed my screenshots and promised me refund and promo code for wireless charger and $25 credit for issue. But I should contact them once order ships. It was finally shipped on March 22. I contacted them for the refund and they asked for screenshots and then said they will process it but after I receive order on March 24. I contact them after receiving order and they againnasked me for screenshots and then gave me ticket # saying once that ticket is approved I will get email within 3 days. 
Yesterday I contacted them as it was past 3 days. This rep said that all the previous reps got it wrong. Unless I have screenshot of order confirmation where the bundle is shown along with date/timestamp, I will only get Samsung credits that will expire within 90 days. The only other way to get money back is to return phone and accessories. I asked for escalation but was ignored.
Phone with these accessories are not worth $2000. Sad but I initiated return. Had they informed back on Feb 9 that they will not refund money, I would have initiated cancelation at that time - would have also saved them money on shipping, return and having to refurbish phone, buds pro, tag and case.  But I guess individual cases like mine are edge cases that can be easily ignored by large companies.
I will be jumping off this subreddit as I will not have S22U anymore. Enjoy your phone and accessories."	N

Need advice on samsung runaround for trade in price match	"I'm posting here since I'm not sure if others in this situation may not see it in the other thread. /samsunggalaxy for pics of email and chat screenshot. 
But I was told and got a reference Id for it, that they would price match my trade in and refund me the difference after evaluation. 
I since seen many others post that Samsung reneged on them and was not able to get back their device. At that point, I chatted with CS via the orders page again to voice my concerns as I haven't yet sent in and also haven't yet received my phone as many delivery delays. 
The agent says he will refund the $150 and to wait 24-48 hours for the email. Well it's been 3 days and I finally get an email that I have to reach out to them again once they evaluate my trade in. 
What should I do at this point? I don't want to send in my device if they will ultimately not give the price match of $150. 
In addition, I was also lied by CS when I last reached out to them to cancel my entire order (as my s8 is still on b/o and also date got moved back) with the 3rd delivery delay on my phone. He told me that the s8 tab would be shipped this week and not to cancel my order for 5% discount. Well, he only gave me a refund on the phone itself and not the entire order.
It sucks that I've been staying home to catch the delivery for 3 days as it needs a signature but ultimately anyone could sign as I found out when they delivered unexpectedly.

on the iPhone you can check notification content immediately after unlocking and while **still on the lock screen.** I never had to actually enter the phone after unlocking with faceID to check notification content. I know the S22 has face unlock but I can not find any option to show notification contents after unlocking without having to actually enter the phone. There is an option to keep on lock screen until I swipe but even enabling this there is no change to the notification viewability

Zagg InvisibleShield Fusion Curve with D3O experience	"I've got my phone at release and been using it without any screen protection for few weeks but I'm too scared of scratching it or it breaking when  I drop the phone that I ordered the protective film(glass?) from them. It wasn't the best experience. My family uses them on iphones and it's fine, but first one I've got had a crease like it was folded... Then when I tried to install it it wasn't perfectly clear when pulling(thing that says pull this first) that it actually pulled the fitment part of it haha. I got it on and it was fine except crease across the screen.. I ordered a replacement which was 12 euros,  so basically a price of a normal screen protector. I just installed it and problem again. This time I pulled it right but when it went on the screen it seemed like there was some residue under the film. It wasn't dust 100% because I made sure to clean it perfectly, do it 5 minutes after the shower, sticky taped anything off screen etc... So I didn't know what to do because it was in few places and I peeled it off and it looked like glue residue. It wasn't from past one because  I removed it and cleaned it well ahead of putting this one... Well I fucking washed it because it wasn't coming out and then put it back on and now it looks scratched to hell. There are some bubbles but not like air ones just idk i pushed and pushed but they stayed. It's only the issue when phone screen is off but it's annoying, it's not a cheap product, installation is a pain in the ass, I know second one is my fault but I have no idea how whatever it was bunched up on few spots because the screen itself was spotless..
&amp;#x200B;
&amp;#x200B;
I'll maybe reorder new one in few months and see if there's any shop that can put it on perfectly or has some sort of machine like apple does for their phones. Or just buy cheap new one idk.
And on top of that, idk if I'm too used to not using any protection like I did for years with my s8+  but it just doesn't feel like glass at all, I know it's a trade off but I expected more. Maybe my memories of thick tempered glass ones that were applied with water is wrong because those felt good, at least in my mind but I don't remember that was a hellova time ago.
&amp;#x200B;
Anyhow, it's expensive, can be PITA to install even though it's ""simple"", their lifetime warranty is great but you pay the shipping that cost as much as new regular film, overall - wouldn't recommend unless you're god at putting these on. I fucking am not and it always pisses me off when something like this happens but I won't risk hundreds of euros for new screen so fuck it.
Oh, and fingerprints are bit harder to read now, gotta really press it and position it well -\_-

I never in a million years would have thought I'd like an android this much after my initial android experiment with the truly awful Samsung Galaxy tab 1 but here I am telling everybody how much I love this phone! I have a couple pain points obviously since I was so used to ios for over a decade one of them being I can't seem to find a good equilibrium between my phone being silent, vibrating, and the alarm not working. I don't like my phone vibrating with not on screen notification and I also want to be able to fall asleep listening to my Bluetooth headphones and be woken up by my phone's alarm through the phone speaker. Any tips?	N

Whatsapp transfer issue!	Hi Guys, I have just switched from iPhone 11 to the S22 Ultra, I was able to get all my data across aside from whatsapp, everytime I do whatsapp seperately it starts to import chats on my new phone but after 98% it takes me back to the screen where it says start importing chats. Anyone else faced a similar issue? Thank You. This issue is after it backs up the data from iphone and is when I actually log in on the samsung. Also I didn’t have any sort of whatsapp on my phone.

Anyone did a trade-in with Samsung this year (2022)? How was your experience with it?	"I have a Samsung Galaxy A20 (used since 2019, not cracked, has a few little scratches on the back and it's a little dusty) that I want to trade in for a Galaxy S22 Ultra. The A20 has a max trade in value of $150.
I've been reading about how horrible the trade in experience was for a lot of people so I'm a little nervous. Even if they do accept the trade-in, if the value turns out to be too low (like below $80), then it would be a waste. I would rather just pay full price and keep my current phone too. 
So I'm curious about whether things are any different this year. Has anyone attempted trade ins this year and what was your experience with it?"	N

Concerned about Fedex delivery need advice	"so phones finally coming in tomorrow, only issue is I need to sign for it and no one will be home for this until about 1pm. knowing my luck Fedex will somehow be delivering packages in the morning in my area, not likely but not unlikely either. I contacted samsung to request to hold the package at a local fedex facility and they sent a request to them to do so but after a call with fedex customer support he told me they likely cant do that even if they're given the request because its a specific delivery restriction.
So it seems my only option is hope they deliver late, hope I can pick it up after a failed delivery (fedex customer support said the option to do that MIGHT show up on the website or it may not), or ... well idk what the third scenario would be lol. Id call out of work but I have a job where I cant really quite do that out of nowhere. What can I do to make sure I get it tomorrow given my situation?"	N
What is the best thin and light case for base S22	"Hi, I just got my green base s22 and loving it. I bought this phone because I really liked its minimal design and dimensions. I want to buy a case for it and want the case is also thin-light and minimally designed.
Since I loved the green color I want to buy a clear case and thinking to buy Spigen Liquid Crystal any suggestions ?"	N
Samsung Google messages baseline	Is it fair to say that all features in the native Google Messages will eventually make their way over to Samsung? Or is the Samsung version of Google Messages just a completely different baseline? Take something like the support for iPhone tap backs currently being in the native build, but not in the Samsung build. Seems reasonable to assume that eventually we will see it in the Samsung build, but just wondering if it actually works that way. Maybe Samsung is just a totally different baseline?

Upgrading my s21 Ultra to S22 Ultra? having second thoughts..

Are my battery expectations for S22 way off?	"So I've had an s22 for just under a week, and while I like the phone, the battery is a huge letdown. I've got the Exynos chip so I've turned off wifi, but even with wifi off my phone will burn 11-12% of the battery just being idle at night (over 20% if I left wifi on). With that kind of passive power drain I'll be down to 60-65% with just 30-40 minutes of screentime after a full work day. So I'm concerned about battery life for days when I'll actually be using it throughout the day.
https://i.imgur.com/sCv6HBT.jpg
I'm having a hard time determining what *should* be happening - is this kind of battery life normal? The phone also has a tendence to get lukewarm in the hand during light use or even in the pocket when it's idle. I'm not really interested in turning off a bunch of features, or turning on power saver - it's a brand new phone after all. 
By comparison my six year old oneplus 3t burns *maybe* 4% battery overnight - and I have way more apps installed on that as well. The thing is, I don't really know if this is to be expected. I don't upgrade my phone often, but when I do, I want something that checks all the boxes. So far, unfortunately, this just doesn't. Am I better off returning it and getting an iphone 13?"	N
Camera Tips and Best Modes?	What's the best camera aspect ratio for taking photos with s22 u? Is there even a reason to use 108 mp mode if we have adaptive pixel? And anyone know when's the best scenario we should use expert raw over the stock camera app?	N
s22 battery life compared to using an older phone	" I just ordered the s22 and I've obviously seen many comments about the battery life, but my current phone has 3000mAh battery which I'm personally fine with as I don't spend too much time on my phone (or I try not to anyway).
For reference, I tend to charge my phone around once a day but this isn't an issue for me, and if I aim for 4h or less SOT it lasts the day fine. So, I was wondering how the battery on the s22 runs compared to that, since my current phone's battery is a bit less than the s22's. Will the battery issues be as noticeable for me as they have been for people coming from larger batteries? Or will it be an improvement even? Just wanna get a rough idea."	N

HDR photo mode in camera?	"Got the March update and can't seem to locate the HDR toggle in the camera setting on my U.S. Snapdragon Galaxy S22 Ultra. See it on the Expert RAW app, but that one doesn't allow me to use the front-facing selfie camera. One of the things that I miss most about the S21 Ultra was the great HDR capabilities, and just sad to see this toggle gone on the S22 Ultra. 
The camera does a sub-par job with selfies when one person is in the shadow and the other person is under the sun, whereas on my older S21 Ultra, that didn't seem to be a problem. Hoping that HDR mode comes back as an explicit thing you can toggle, or if someone knows of a hack or workaround, please let me know."	N

Should I switch from the S20 Ultra to the S22	"I'm getting a new phone because my screen got cracked and insurance can't replace it because it's on backorder and have left me the choice to get something new 
The obvious upgrade from the s20 Ultra would be the 22 ultra, but I like the smaller size of the regular s22 and think a smaller phone would be nice. But on paper it looks like I'd be downgrading.

The device did not arrive after 5 days. I called their reps again and mentioned the case. They just apologized that they weren't able to deliver the device and that is due to the volume of the orders. They promised to have my device delivered by April 5. 
I swear if this will not arrive by April 5, I'm about to be a full-blown Karen at Samsung and buy iPhone 13 mini instead."	N

For everyone that has the Galaxy S22+, how is your overall experience and how is the battery life?	Currently own an iPhone X. After having an iPhone since the 4, I’m considering making the jump to Samsung.	N
I've had the S22 base model for a couple months and I have some thoughts on the camera and photo editor I believe Samsung needs to adress	"Most egregious:
So you save all your photos on heic. It's smaller than jpeg while maintaining more quality. That's great! You take a photo and decide to adjust the brightness a bit in the default photo editor. You go to save the picture and... That's weird. All of a sudden the picture looks crunchier. Some text in a sign is suddenly unreadable. What happened? Well when editing a photo with the photo editor, the picture can only be exported in jpeg even if the photo was originally heic. There are no options whatsoever. If you want to touch up your photo, you must sacrifice photo quality for no apparent reason. This is the biggest offender I've found and really needs to be patched.
Most perplexing: 
sometimes when I open the camera to take a video, when I watch the video back the first several seconds will have several dropped frames. Before smoothing out. This can ruin a video if you're trying to capture a special moment. It's not like 4k 60fps should be very demanding. That's been something the galaxy line has offered for several generations at this point. Not sure if it has something to do with CPU throttling but there needs to be a performance mode option for the camera to prevent this.
Lack of options in portrait mode:
If you've played around in portrait mode you've likely seen the backdrop mode. It picks a color and inserts it into the background. It looks very nice, but it seemingly picks a color at random between blue, red, and green and gives you no options to alter it. Where's the creative control?
A fun idea: 
I've been playing around with the object eraser in the photo editor quite a bit. It's frankly amazing. The edge detection is really good. But the functionality is very limited. When selecting an object you should have the ability to save the object as a sticker that you can then use in future photos."	N
After a little over a week with the s22U, I'm just not convinced	"Now don't get me wrong, it's a great phone! But coming from the s20+ (and it might just be me) I don't see a whole lot of difference, minus the physical ones.
I think I've touched the s pen once(?)
I get just about the same SOT as I did on my s20+
Overall, it just seems like the same experience with a larger display
Now I would like opinions on this, is it worth keeping? Or should I just stick it out with the s20+?"	N
Update on my base model Galaxy S22 Battery life - After 2 weeks.	"2 weeks ago today, my base model (128/8GB) S22 (non-plus) arrived. Out of the box, I got around 4 hours of mixed-use SoT, as shown by my previous posts (Link: https://www.reddit.com/user/QalaniKing4351/comments/tiqlp0/accubattery_stats_for_base_s22_exynos_after_5/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share). Now, I am getting just over 6 hours of SoT (Link: https://www.reddit.com/user/QalaniKing4351/comments/ts8i9k/accubattery_stats_for_base_model_s22_after_2/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share). I have noticed that this improved significantly over the past couple of days. At the moment, I have 3 hours and 35 minutes of SoT, and a battery % of 38%. 
Hope this helps!"	N
App Drawer Vertical Scrolling ONE UI 4 - MUST	Please enable vertical scrolling for the app drawer.Samsung has gone out of way to make this worse for customers, since on basic android default is vertical scrolling.It just seems like Samsung want everybody to use Nova Launcher instead of their own by intention.Please provide the option to change to vertical scroll for app drawer.

Video Calling on Unlocked Devices	Let's talk about it. Why can't we have Verizon video calls on Unlocked phones? I have the feature enabled in the Verizon platform online...it's always been this way with unlocked devices I feel like we should be able to get carrier video calls enabled.	N
Double tap and drag to zoom	My old note 5 used to allow to click on image from a chrome page and double tap and dragging down to zoom in as a one hand operation feature. S22 ultra does not seam to have this feature for a bigger screen phone? It just wants to reload the page when double tap and dragging down. Any way to enable this in settings?	N
No More Seperate Notification Sounds	So I've seen this issue brought up online but it's like I'm being gaslighted by the answers. The pathways that they suggest just dont exist on my phone but somehow the person with the problem does. I'm so frustrated..	N
Temporary "fix" for "Warning: Camera Failed"	I think I may have found a temporary fix for the camera failing on the S22 Ultra. I noticed it only really happens to me when I'm connected to a 5G network. If you experience camera failed then put your phone in airplane mode and try to take another picture. My 0.6x camera fails only when 5G is on that I've noticed so far but when it works it takes beautiful pictures. So I don't think it's a hardware failure but a software bug possibly.	N
S22 ultra - some limitations	While the return of the Note and integrated S pen is appreciated, just wanted to pen down some thoughts on the step back from Note10+ and Note 20 ultra devices -1. No more MST support in Samsung Pay – was the only differentiating and USP for Samsung’s own payment app when it could work on older magnetic stripe terminals without needing NFC support. So if you have favorite retailer (like Walmart for example) that hasn’t upgraded to NFC terminals, you might not be able to use the s22 ultra for mobile payments2. Loss of aptX- Qualcomms own bluetooth codec wasnt widely used but still boasted the compatibility of Note10+ to support a better codec than SBC or AAC. LDAC support still continues in S22 ultra3. Lack of true super slo mo capture- Note 10+ could capture true 720p @960 fps albeit only for 0.8s while S22 lacks native 960fps slow-motion video. On Galaxy S22 Ultra, users can record approximately 1 second of video captured at 480 fps and digitally enhance the video to 960 fps with approximately 32 seconds of playback4. Increased weight – the S22 ultra weighs a significant 30g more than the note10 plus. Users will notice this difference as soon as the pick up however, might get accustomed to it with time5. Lack of a micro sd slot - while the base storage and ram were lower than note 10 and 20 devices (not to mention the steadily increasing base prices), the real limitation is not being able to expand your memory for cheap with an SD card. While cloud storage is an option this is a real limitation for power users who travel often to take advantage of steady internet to upload as well as access cloud storage.As a closing thought, most software features advertised in s22 ultra is now available in note 10 plus and Note 20 ultra, with the ONE UI 4.1 update including things like object eraser, smart widgets updated camera, calendars and gallery apps.

S22 Ultra VZW Puerto Rico	I travel to Puerto Rice for work a few times a month. Every VZW phone I've had automatically connects to the extended network here without issue, but now my S22 Ultra requires a manual connection and disconnects regularly going to "emergency service only." Working through it with VZW tech support they've had me check the settings, reset the network, and do a refresh on their end yet the issue persists. Any ideas?

S22 Ultra Wallet recommendations (Am I asking too much?)	"Ok guys and gals. 
I need some help. 
We moved recently and I lost my wallet. 
We've looked everywhere and it hasn't turned up. I do however always have my phone on me so if I combine them both I likely won't lose it again. 
My Mous case has been excellent and I love the ergos but their 3.0 Wallet has been sold out for weeks and I need something ASAP
I'm open to a hybrid setup like MagSafe rings as long as they don't interfere with the S Pen. 
Requirements:
Wireless charge compatible (I have a Samsung Duo charging pad and want to keep it)
Adequate protection. I AM NOT A FAN OF CHUNKY CASES. But I also don't want anything flimsy that will do nothing in a drop situation. 
Room for 3-4 cards at most. 
I'd prefer something I can remove but if it doesn't that isn't a deal breaker. 
Oh Snap has a really neat MagSnap wallet on Kickstarter but I am not sure if their ring setup will work with the camera placement and it won't be delivered until June. 
S Pen compatible.

Overall the phone is great, slight drain in battery, but whatever since it needs to learn my usage pattern, but it's not bad all.

Display not as sharp?	Hey folks, so I got my s22 ultra, and i love it. But coming from A71 I find the colors kind of greyed out and pixels kind of blurry?

I can rly see the difference when scrolling Instagram, the pics look kind of zoomed in, the colors not as vibrant...Is it just me?	N

65W Trio Power Adapter Not For S22 Ultra?	Just spoke with Samsung chat and was informed the 65W Trio Power Adapter is not compatible with the S22 Ultra?

Undecided about buying one, hoping for input from current owners	"Hi all, 
I want to get a US/snapdragon unlocked S22Ultra 256gb but I am unsure about it. Was hoping to get input, such as likes/dislikes/experiences with it so far, from current owners (ideally US/snapdragon). 
My current phone is an S10 (6.1""), I think it will take some time to get used to the 6.8"" size. Never owned a Note device before either. 
My questions/concerns so far: 
- battery / SOT times. Current phone has a 3500mah battery, most of my usage involves reading reddit and some video watching; I don't play any mobile games. 5000mah should be enough right? I keep seeing posts anywhere between 4hrs to 6-8hrs. Not sure what to expect. 
- overheating issues. Is that still a thing or has the march update fixed it?
- android auto. Does it work via usb connection? I remember reading a post a while ago about it not working even with usb debugging turned on
- connection/calls dropping. Seen a couple threads about this but couldn't figure out if it was for snapdragon or exynos. 
- will cases interfere with taking out the s pen? 
- on the topic of the s pen, does it only go in one way or will it get stuck if one day i try to put it back in with the side button facing the other way? Is the pen tied to the phone or will any s pen work? 
- will i need pants with deeper pockets to fit the phone? Biggest phone size I've had so far is 6.1"", not sure what to expect. 
- has anyone gotten their device from Amazon or BestBuy? Will Samsung honor warranty in the case that something goes wrong? (Getting some mixed info about this)
\---
All in all, I'm leaning towards getting it but not sure if to buy it now or wait a couple months for stuff to iron out. That said, my current phone still works, but the patches are getting slower, and the new stuff the S22u offers are interesting."	N

April update for S22 Ultra Exynos is out for most of Europe	"About 1375.96MB, I hope it will improve battery life.
EDIT:
Kernel is 5.10.66 so it is not immediately clear if it contains the patch for CVE-2022-0847 ""Dirty Pipe"" (it should have been 5.10.102 to immediately say it does have it, but is possible to also have backports) - we will likely know more in a few days (when normally the security details are made public).
The GPS seems to start somehow slower than before (at first restart it took ages, I did start a second time and it seemed to be slower than before but acceptable, so first time it was likely the delay when first restarting after an update)."	N

display bug? or hardware issue?	"so I've had my s22 ultra for about 2 weeks now, and a few days ago i noticed this very thin line appear on my screen, and becomes especially prominent when i lower the brightness. 
I've also noticed that the screen has a green tint when in low brightness and progressively gets worse with lower brightness, as well as the always on display flickering with a weird reddish tint in a dark place (ie a room with no lights).
what i want to know is if this is a display bug like the s20 series or if it's a hardware issue, bc if it's the latter i would like to replace my device before my 30 day replacement warranty expires.

It finally arrived ... First impressions base s22	"I have the base s22 256gb in white, beautiful looking phone, better then expected.
Only had the phone for 1 day so too early to discuss battery life but so far seems acceptable.
I upgraded from the base s20 and I like the new screen, looks that much clearer to me and the new aspect ratio might be a subtle change but a much welcome one. I prefer the extra width in the screen compared to length much more useable and actuallymakes the screen look bigger then that of the s22.
Speakers are very good, any louder then this and you should be looking at getting a stero system. Good depth and clarity.
Main issue I'm finding is the camera bump is a little sharp on my fingers, especially at bottom where it meets the frame  (I would have preferred a slightly smoother border here). I'm sure those that use a case won't have this issue but I've always hated cases so won't be going down that route

Anyone coming from a Pixel 3 to S22?	"I need to upgrade my P3 this month (son is getting my P3 for his birthday), and looking for a smaller phone.  I checked out the S22 at BestBuy and really like this phone.  However, I'm a little reluctant reading all the bad battery reviews.  I understand it will get better after 1-2 weeks but afraid to take the plunge.  My only other option is an iphone 13pro (small, good camera, good batt) but I'd prefer to stay on Android if possible.
For anyone coming from a P3 - how does the battery life compare?  I have not been keeping track of my SOT but have been very pleased with my 3+ year old P3.  I am probably not a heavy user (no gaming, no video streaming) but use GPS a lot.  If its as good as my P3 it will be fine for me.
Here is how I use my phone:
* Camera
* GPS:
* Strava (3-4 hour sessions)
* Google maps (I know its not best practice but always charging while driving)
* CalTopo
* Stream Spotify while driving
* Gmail, social media
My biggest concern with battery is long (4 hour) sessions using Strava and CalTopo.  Its essential that the battery not die.  The phone would be 100% charged in most cases to start.
Also - I really want a set and forget.  I abuse the crap out of my P3 battery (always charge to 100%, always charge while driving) and just don't want to have to manage it with a new phone.  I'm ok with some initial setup to get it dialed.
Really appreciate your input!  Cheers!"	N

How come the sky blue version of the Galaxy S22 Ultra has a matte black frame and the phantom black version has a glossy black frame, despite both having the same frame material?	"Apologies in advance if this is a stupid question. 
So I've been watching some reviews of the sky blue Galaxy S22 Ultra. Some of the reviewers noted that the sky blue variation has a matte black frame while the phantom black version has a glossy frame. However when I look at the materials in the specs, it just says the frame is made of aluminum. Nothing like ""this material frame for this color, that material frame for that color"", which implies it's aluminum for all the colors. 
Are the specs inaccurate or is there something I don't understand?
Here's one of the videos where the youtuber claims that the sky blue version has matte sides while the phantom black version has glossy sides.

My battery life and some general questions	"S22+ Exynos
My battery life this week has been good enough for my use. I average 4-5h screen on time and 16h-1d of screen of time. Over night drain or idle drain is 2% over the course of like 7ish hours. How does that compare to other peoples screen on/off times?
Brightness is around 10-20%, Adaptive battery is on, when im at work 7am-3pm i use 4g and when im at home wifi ofc., 60hz, light use( reddit, youtube, emails etc. I dont play games on my phone). I use the 85% protection thing and charge my phone at 30% so the average screen on/off time I mentioned is done on 55% of battery.
I've seen posts with 8h scren on time and like 15h screen off time on the base and other versions with default settings. Considering those times are with battery being used 100%-0%. Some photos were posted with battery stats on which youtube drains 8% in 1h 30min while on my phone it drains double of that in the same time.
If I were to disable the 85% protection and use my phone 100%-20% with the things like 120hz and such turned back on what are the potential scren on/off times I can get  by looking at what im getting right now. I know the battery goes through a stress process while being charged over 80% and is discharged lower than 20% how much damage does that do to a battery long term? Battery capacity is obviously going to reduce in the time of 2 years. Cant I just get a new battery if the current one goes bad? I dont plan on buying a new phone for atleast 3,4 years."	N

Case recommendation for the s22 base model.	" Hi, I just got my green base s22 and loving it. I bought this phone because I really liked its minimal design and dimensions. I want to buy a case for it and want the case is also thin-light and minimally designed.
Since I loved the green color I want to buy a clear case and thinking to buy Spigen Liquid Crystal any suggestions ?"	N
Soft/grippy case with screen edge protection and drop protection?	"I know I know, people have asked before about cases, but I'm trying to find one that's decent for the s22 ultra and am hitting dead ends.
I used to like the Speck Presidio Grip cases until they got rid of the rubber grips.
On the s21 ultra I tried the incipio grip case, but it was made of a hard slippery plastic and the grips were not grippy at all, and dug into my hand and tried to rip holes in my mesh gym short pockets.
I tried the dbrand grip case, but it doesn't provide any protection for the long curved edges and feels like sandpaper. 
Currently I'm using a caseology pop color case, but it doesn't feel too great, doesn't go quite as high on the curved edges as I'd like, and I don't think it has any official drop protection.
I've tried looking online but other cases like the Spigen Tough Armor also say they don't protect the sides of the curved screen, and I suspect it's made of some cheap hard plastic on the exterior.
Does anyone have any recommendations based on my feedback here? I'd really love some ideas if there's anything I'm overlooking."	N

S22U Battery - Update on My Experience	"I thought it'd only be fair for me to make another post about my battery experience since I made a post after first getting the phone and having some concerns.
The TL:DR is I'm getting amazing battery life. (Note this is the Snapdragon version) 
Edit: I should add a few other things I forgot to mention originally. I have AOD always turned on. I run the phone at maximum resolution with adaptive refresh rate turned on. 
I've been using Accubattery Pro to track by battery information since I got my phone. At first it was showing some lower than I thought was reasonable battery capacity estimates (It was suggesting I only had around 4700 of capacity) along with faster battery drain than I'd expect.
Doing some digging I discovered OneUi has the habit of absolutely crushing apps like Accubattery in the background and would constantly kill the task making it hard to get accurate readings. I had to change some settings and have been basically testing it for a month now. Estimated battery capacity is now 4952 which is well within the guaranteed range and also very close to the said 5000 mah of battery so I'm happy with that.
As far as battery life itself on the phone is concerned, I can only say that after the phone has made adjustments for my habits I'm absolutely killing it with battery life. A few notes on this, I use dark theme, and as much amoled black apps as possible but other than that I don't do anything special. I leave my phone on auto brightness and I do mostly use wifi but I watch YouTube, play games, and everything else you'd expect from a phone. I'm easily getting a full day's worth of battery with plenty left over.
For example yesterday I had 13 hours 59 minutes of usage with 6 hours and 15 minutes of screen on time and was at 38% for battery life.
Another day I had 15 hours 37 minutes of usage with 5 hours 45 minutes of SOT and was at 36% for battery.
Day before that I had 17 hours 42 minutes of usage with 7 hours 36 minutes of SOT and was at 28% battery.
13h 40m, 4h 58m SOT, 48% battery.
16h 2m, 6h 5m SOT, 36% battery.
15h 19m, 7h 5m SOT, 32% battery.
16h 1m, 5h 17m SOT, 44% battery.
The list goes on and on. I'm routinely getting 6-7 hours of SOT in a day and still having 1/3 of my battery life left. This would put my average at around 9+ hours of SOT with a single charge and that's just plain great.
My one area I'd be really interested in seeing improvements with new generation chips will when the device is asleep. I'm routinely burning 1.6 to 2% of battery per hour with the phone screen turned off. This means even with very little usage you still are looking at basically a max of 2 days and that's taking it down to zero. If they could get that number lower to around 1% an hour that'd really increase the time you can use your phone.
Still I can't complain as these numbers are absolutely great and way better than what a lot of people were originally talking about."	N

Any S22Ultra owners having charging disconnects?	"Using an old 20W samsung block with a USB to USB-C cable. Ill plug my phone in before bed and while laying down I will hear the phone constantly reconnect over and over. Ill have to get up and constantly readjust the cable to try to get it to stay connected. I've tried different cables and even went out and bought a whole new cable and it still happens. The phone has done this since I first got it and I have not damaged it and checked the port for debris.  
What is odd is I went over to a friends recently and used his USB-C to USB-C cable with a USB-C block and it worked perfectly. I'm unsure if I just got the perfect cable angle first try or if the USB-C cable is more reliable.  
I was planning on trying a whole new charge box with the new cable I just bought and if that didnt work to get a whole new USB-C box with a USB-C to USB-C cable but spending all this extra money just to get a reliable charge seems ridiculous. Anyone else having charging issues to this extent?"	N

S22 Ultra charger	"After finally getting my phone, I notice that there is only a cable inside the box. So after spending $1000+, I have to buy an additional wall charger block?

A53 vs S22 Ultra vs Other	"My current phone is an S7 Edge I got six years ago. I need a new one.
I also have a terrible time with making decisions. I've been reading about many different phones and I don't really understand what I'm reading through spec lists and reviews. 
I am not techy. If I play any games on my phone, it would be Solitaire or Sudoku. I don't care about the camera. 
I use my phone to listen to music, scroll Reddit and sometimes Facebook, shop, pay bills, look at Foodgawker, get sucked into the Wikipedia rabbithole. That's it.
I had decided a couple months ago I was getting the A52 because I liked that it had an aux port and I could add a memory card. I have Verizon, though, so I learnt that is out.
The A53 will give me the expandable memory. The S22 Ultra gives me the S pen, which I know is just a fancy bell and whistle and I am falling right into their trap for wanting it, but it is what it is. Probably not worth the $700. I don't know what the right choice is here."	N
I just upgraded from the Pixel 6 to the S22 Ultra. This camera is disappointing.	The phone is great, overall. But man, this camera is a downgrade. My last Note device was the 3. I expected way more from the camera on a 1200 dollar device.	N
Will ever S22U stop being trash?	"I preordered S21U and now S22U, S22Ultra was one of my fav S phones since I had almost all of them. My top list is now S9+,S21U and S7Edge.
Sadly S22U is nothing but expensive totem of unluck.
4.1OneUI works better on S21U now with this update S21U take better photos video  and everything is butter smooth.
S22U is laggy, randomly restarts, freezes and doing all weird stuff. All now ""partner"" apps as Instagram or Snap are unusable since camera won't open ever.
Why would samsung release most expensive phone in such bad condition. And yes. I have Exinos, and before you'll star saing it problém of chip.... I DONT CARE, I payd 29 000 cz around 1300 USD for this garbage and it wont let me take picture day one without restart after each photo...
All 3 month updates did nothing, but fixed restarting, but it got replaced by stutter.

S22 Ultra camera Lens usage question	"I've been trying to figure out how the S22 ultra uses the 4 lenses. I know that the phone does pixel ""binning"" to improve light-gathering and image quality. (binning combines multiple pixels into a single pixel - and the 108mp sensor combines groups of 9 pixels into a single pixel to create a 12mp image [108 / 9 = 12] ). 
To see how each lens is used, I took images at different resolutions and covered one or more lenses to see if the image would be affected. Here's what I found:  Magnification  Lens(es) Used  0.6x  top only  1x  middle-left & top-left lenses  2x  middle-left lens only  3x  middle-left lens only  5x  middle-left lens only  10x  bottom-left lens only  > 10x  bottom-left lens only w/digital zoom   
What I can't figure out is that when taking an image at 1x magnification, TWO lenses are used - the top-left and middle-left. If I cover either one of those lenses, the image taken is blank. 
Can anyone explain why two lenses are used for 1x images?? 
Thanks,
bert"	N

Thankfully Amazon had Whitestone Dome Glass screen protectors available for same-day delivery so those will be coming in at any moment. I picked up the UAG Civilian from Best Buy.  
All in all, I'm really glad to be back on a new Samsung phone that has a built-in S Pen. These cameras are phenomenal!"	N

Expert RAW Question	"I have downloaded this new Samsung app Expert RAW and have a few questions/confusions. In my case, probably 80%+ of my photos have no need for RAW. My main question is this: 
It seems that by default, after installing the app, the original camera app on the phone still works the same and will take JPG photos the same as before. If you want to shoot a photo using Expert RAW, then opening the Expert RAW app is what you do. Is this correct procedure or is there a better, easier way to switch between shooting RAW and no RAW photos? It seems like it would be easier to only have one user interface to get good at and to just use the Expert Raw app all the time. But this would only make sense for me if there was a way in the ER app to easily switch between shooting and saving only a processed JPG file and then, when you need it, take a photo that includes saving the RAW file. Can you do this, or do I need to use the standard camera app most of the time and then open the separate Expert RAW app when I think I need a RAW file? Thanks! 
I ask this mainly because I like the interface of the Expert RAW app and would use that exclusively if there was an easy way to turn RAW on and off on a per shot basis."	N

Real differences between HD+ and WQHD resolution	Hi, I'm wondering if with normal use (not video, just messenger, Instagram etc) there is a noticeable difference between HD+ and WQHD+ resolution.

S22U, messaging, and S watch compatibility	My S22U comes this week, and I had a few questions- So I've heard a few mixed thing about the way messaging was going with the new software and the approach Samsung is taking this time around- mainly some saying Google messages has totally taken over as the messenger, others saying that Samsung messages still exists but now is just a skin on google messages, and others saying it's not, but it doesnt really have a function anymore. Can anyone tell me what the actual status of this is? The reason I ask now instead of waiting is that I am considering picking up a S watch at the same time as the phone (watch is on sale), and this all ties into that- transitioning to next set of questions, anyone using a S watch with their 22U? How does messaging work with it, are you using samsung or google messages? Do you have to be on LTE or connected via bluetooth, or can you still use the messaging app via only wifi if your accounts are linked? My goal is to be able to leave my phone in my backpack or coat pocket or desk while I'm at work, then just use the watch for messaging when I have to go to a different floor or department (I work at a big place with a big wifi net, so I'd always have wifi access). Any other noteworthy comments about 22U x S watch combo? Is it worth going to the watch 4 now, or should I wait a few months for the 5 to launch? (I know it isn't all 22U related, but I figured this would be the best place to ask because messaging is supposedly approached differently on the 22s than previous models, may also post in another thread(or threads))	N
Love this phone but what's up with the camera?	"I'm surprised that a phone proposed as having massive sensors to capture more light and large megapixel count puts out really average to below average photos.
I have attempted to adjust the settings and changing the setting to 108mp when I think it justifies it. 
Perhaps I'm doing something wrong. I have tried raw photos and editing them myself but it's a lot of faff for some point and shoot moments I want to capture. 
Everything else I love about the phone so a fix for the camera would complete my experience with it!"	N

battery tip for s22, 22+ and ultra	"I see a lot of people using the ""protect battery"" feature but that leaves you will less battery life on a phone that's already not great at keeping it. 
Solution: Bixby routines
Go to Bixby routine and make 2 routines. 
1. add time specific ""if"" statement for when you normally go to bed and set the ""then"" to ""battery protect on"". 
This will allow your phone to charge to 85% at night while you sleep. 
2. Add time specific ""if"" for an hour before you normally wake up and set ""then"" to ""battery protect off"".
This will let your phone charge to 100% by the time you wake up. 
Why: This will let you start the day off with a full charge so you don't have to charge as soon but at the same time keep the battery from the stress of being at 100% all night every night. 
Hopefully this helps some of you!"	N

Ordered 128gb model from Verizon today. coming from s20 plus. second guessing the decision	"I must've missed the fact that the base model only has 8gb ram compared to the 12gb in my s20 plus. 
I don't really multitask too much on my phone. The most I do is maybe have 2 or 3 apps open to enter info online or something like that. 
I always close apps after I'm done with them because it bugs me having them open.
If I'm gaming the only app I have open is the game I'm playing (world of tanks blitz or CoD mobile are the only ones I play)
I don't think it'll be an issue for me but I wish they kept the 12gb ram across all models since I don't need 256 gb of storage.
My s20 plus is still super fast and never stutters but I decided to trade it in because the screen is cracked and I got $700 on trade for it which makes the price of the ultra easier to manage.
At the end of the day do you guys really think the less RAM will be noticible?"	N

S21U SPen works on S22U	So I decided to try the S21U SPen on my S22U. It works (minus Bluetooth)! Now that I think about it and have been using the S21U pen more than I did before, I feel Samsung should have made the S22U (and all future phone SPen) SPen the same size. It's more comfortable to hold and use. With altering the internals of the phone, I believe Samsung can make it fit inside. I also have been using it on my Tab S8U too.	N

Move from Note 10 to S22+	"Used my Note 10 with 256gb for around 2 1/2 years now. I loved its small footprint and the stylus, however the battery got pretty bad, performance wasn't as good anymore and just in general some things have moved on like new display tech, higher refresh rate, better cameras and so on. So I decided to trade in my trusty Note for a new S22+ green with 256gb. 
So far, so good. Battery life is miles better. After work I got like 50-60% battery left while with my Note 10 I was struggling to keep it alive. And since I need my phone to work during the day for my job it was a huge issue for me. Some months ago I swapped the battery out for a new one, but it didn't really improve as much as I hoped. 
The screen is also miles better and much more fluid, thanks to a somewhat dynamic 120hz refresh rate. Brightness and overall colors are also way better. My Note 10 had an annoying green tint with light greys and whites. The screen from my S22+ seems perfect. 
Performance is really good too. It's not iphone Level of smooth, but the smoothest phone I've used to far. It's still skipping frames in places and while scrolling, but not often so it doesn't bother me. 
Software support is amazing and worthy of a flagship phone. By far the best support for an Android phone.
Cameras seem really good. The Note 10 was no slouch in that regard too. For any serious photography I'll use my dedicated Fujifilm camera. Speakers are a little bit louder and clearer too. Haptics are different, but still really good and precise. Added 5G is also a nice benefit, e g. I get actual data coverage at my workplace now.
I also don't really miss the stylus. Only thing I did was write down some notes for shopping or ordering food. It looked professional, but you can do the same in Samsung notes just with your keyboard. It was fun though. 
Overall I'm really happy with the S22+. It's worth the upgrade for me and unlike most posts I'm more than content with the battery life. It will probably improve a little bit the more I'll use it. It's a phone that does everything I need it to do and has the stability and speed to rely on. It's a phone worth keeping for many years to come."	N
Is the app switching gesture different on the s22?	"I came from a Pixel 4XL and I'm having trouble with the app switching gesture at the bottom. Not sure if it is because of my case but I've always used cases. 
Under setting I increased the area for the gestures but I think it only creased the area of the side gestures. 
Do launchers affect this? I'm using nova launcher. Is there a better launcher that will get me closer to how the pixel launcher worked?
Edit: just to be clear, I can switch apps using the bottom gesture, it just isn't as easy to use as I'm used to."	N
The Best for the battery ?	"Hi
Here is the question :
In a use case where for example I am using the hot-spot option a lot and the phone at the same time, the battery will melt
Is it better to let the phone all the time plugged in to charge (with the 85% protection enabled)
Is it better to let it go down to 20%, charge it to 85%, let it discharge again...
Since after working I will anyway unplug it to use it freely until it.needs to be charged again

That normal or can most of those somehow be deactivated as a lot of them Ive never opened before.
Second big question is performance on games. Im in the US so have snapdragon but on games like COD and Madden the game lags.

S22+ Extended Warranty Vs Device Protection Plan	"User from India. Recently bought S22Plus. Last phone was Note 8 and used for 5 years. Planning to use this also for another 5 years.
Confused on whether to purchase Samsung Extended warranty (additional 12months) worth INR 4999 (~$65) vs Device Protection plan (24M Accidental damage +Extended Warranty ) at INR 9999 ($130).
Samsung says for any Accidental damage claim, a claim amount of approx INR 2500 will be charged and is only claimable once a year.

just replaced a new Galaxy S22+ within the month	Hey, guys. I'm new to the Galaxy series. I ordered the galaxy s22+ a little under a month ago and I had it for a couple of weeks before I started having problems with the charging port. It would charge but if I wiggled it around ever so slightly it would stop. Thankfully, it was still under warranty because I only had it for 19 days. However, it got me wondering if maybe it was my power adapter that might have fried the port. The power adapter I'm using is from a Razer Phone 2, and it's voltage and amps outputs say 5v=3a, 9v=2.67a, 12v=2a. When I'm charging my phone it gives me the super fast charging which is great. Is this okay to use on the gs22+?	N

Camera app improvements to request from support:	"\- Option to specify a lower limit for the shutter speed for action photography in pro mode. Explanation: For subjects in motion, a certain shutter speed must be kept as a minimum to prevent motion blur. For example, I would set a limit of 1/250th and the camera increases the ISO value before it would have to expose slower but (very important) selects a faster time when in bright areas the ISO value can no longer be set below 50. The manual mode is not an alternative because in changing light conditions it would stick to 1/250 and thus overexpose. In action photography, however, there is usually no time to make manual adjustments, so a lower limit of the exposure time is very important and has long been standard with ""real"" cameras.
\- Please check if a continuous shooting mode in Pro Mode with DNG support is possible, does not have to be as fast as jpg mode and burst can be limited to a smaller number of frames.
\- A higher resolution DNG mode, there is the 108MP JPG mode with detail enhancement that still gets details out of the sensor that are not captured in 12MP mode. But only JPG and only in automatic mode. An optional high resolution DNG would be nice, 108MP would probably be unnecessary but a 27MP RAW (which is scaled down by a factor of 4) would probably be very usable.
\- Add Depthmap to the Portrait JPGs as a layer, the Portrait Mode JPGs already contain the 2 shots from the two cameras used and the final image where the crop is calculated from the difference of the two images. It would be nice if the generated Depthmap was also included as a gray layer, in order to be able to use this externally for pseudo 3D effects, for example."	N
How to optimise your device for better battery life!	"Hello guys, So I've been playing around with some setting and have figured out how to make the Exynos S22 more stable and battery efficient, I've gained around 1-2 hours SOT and much better standby drain.
The main issue is bad optimisation which causes the Exynos to overheat, throttle and then eat away at your battery. The second issue is Google play services in the background constantly doing things when it's not needed.
I won't go through the basic battery savings tips, adaptive brightness, battery saving mode, adaptive battery, these are quite common and I'm sure most people can figure them out.
First thing first, Go into your battery settings then background usage limits and put every app you don't receive notifications from into a deep sleep, calculator, voice recorder, maps, gallery etc.. None of these apps have any reason to run in the background once you have closed them. This will save you battery life &amp; RAM.  Only set never sleep on apps that you use all day and need notifications for example WhatsApp and set sleeping onto apps that you still want notifications from but not urgently for example: social networks.
Next download good guardians from the Samsung store and then thermal guardians, set the thermal threshold to the lowest and then in additional settings check everything other than apply standard motion, this helps massively with overheating and stops the device throttling which causes lag and battery drain.
Next is google services, go to your settings and then the Google section. This part is very thorough, Google has a lot of hidden sections that drain battery like crazy, go through them individually and disable anything that you don't recognise or use. For example: WiFi scanning, nearby share, scan for nearby devices... Disable them all. These are features you will never even realise you had but are constantly in the background draining your battery.
Last is to use Bixby routines to limit your sync &amp; location settings. Having location and sync turned on all the time kills your battery and has no real reason to be on 24/7.
Sync is only used to backup accounts &amp; push sync data from apps like Gmail, if you have this turned on all the time your phone is constantly trying to sync the same thing over and over. I have set a bixby routine so that at 7am my device syncs for 10 minutes and then turns off. I have also set Bixby routines so that when I open Google photos or Gmail sync turns on and then turns off when I close the apps. You get the idea and are best to play around with it.
The same goes for location, why does your phone need to be scanning for your locations all day? You can set Bixby to turn on location only on the apps you want it to. For example: My location only turns on when I open Google maps and then turns off when I close the app.
Bixby routines is great to use for other battery saving methods to and I recommend you use them, I also have mine set so that if a Bluetooth device disconnects for more than 10 minutes then it will turn off automatically.
I hope this helps! It would be great to hear feedback to see if this improves your battery life.
Enjoy!"	N

S22 Ultra's polish chipped off from side panels	"I have been using s22 ultra for less than a month now. There's been a case on it since day 1. It's a normal case that I bought from the market. And last week I noticed that there are a number of scratches on the side panels (left and right) of the phone. The polish has been chipped off from places. I do not understand how this happened as I haven't dropped my phone. My usage isn't rough. The only places my phone has been at - my bed, my pocket and in my car. 
Has anyone else experienced the same thing?  
Because at this point I'm going crazy thinking how this has happened in such a short span of time.
I have attached the pictures of the cover and phone as well. The scratches are not clearly visible but you can get a vague idea.

A) transfer my information/data with my old number to ensure everything is working smoothy and then change the new number
B) wait for my new sim, change the number and  transfer info all at the same time?

How to disable drag to open here	I have a Galaxy S22 Ultra with Android 12, MultiStar and Good Lock installed. WHen using Solid Explorer, I would drag between panels or drag files into folders with my finger, but now it seems the OS is overlaying "Drag to Open Here" popups for split screen or popup view. When I drop what is an in-app link of the file(s), I get a message that the file cannot be opened in the default app for that type in the window/popup area. This is a feature I would like to disable as it blocks the use of dragging in Solid Explorer. I have tried searching and found that My Files might be this feature, but cannot see in the settings on how to disable it. Please help.	N

S22 just seems like a downgrade in so many ways even thou it's a newer phone, I love small phone just wish they used the same internals like they did for s20 line. The smaller screen, glass and pocketablitly is what made want to purchase...but I feel like trading in my s21 ultra isnt worth it"	N

I've just dropped my S-Pen in my poo.	"Yep, you've read that correctly. Ive just dropped my brand new S-Pen out of my brand new S22 Ultra in my poo.
I literally received my phone today after rocking the S10 for a few years. 
Been playing around with the phone all day, at home as my case hasn't yet arrived and will continue to do so until my phone number has switched over too.
I've not long sat down for a dump (Still pooping, in utter shock with myself). Decided to to do some colouring whilst I poop to pass the time and as I go to pull the S-Pen out, accidentally pull a little too quick and the sly little fucker rockets down into the bowl and into my turd.
I honestly stared at it for a good two minutes, wondering what to do (what else except fish it out, vile, I know, I did wash my hands before continuing to poop and type this.
Quickly googled if its water-proof (thank the lord it is), doesn't change the fact I will forever be paranoid that that my S-Pen has faecal matter on it and is now an S(hit)-Pen though.
Anyway, thanks for your attention, thought this might make some of you laugh.
P.S: Worst part is, not the first time my phone/accessories have landed in my poo, last time I changed phone case cause despite sterile cleaning, it still made me paranoid. I am a clean freak."	N

Any way to disable pull-to-refresh in Samsung Internet browser?	"Does anyone else besides me dislike the pull to refresh ""feature"" in the Samsung Internet browser? Is there anyway to disable this?
I find it particularly easy (sensitive) to trigger and I end up inadvertently refreshing webpages when I don't mean to, sometimes wiping out unsaved work like typing or other inputs that are erased upon page refresh. 
The amount of times when I actually need to refresh webpages is pretty limited and the pull to refresh feature seems unnecessary imho. It's easy enough to refresh a page already with the address bar. I wonder if this was copied from the likes of the Facebook app or other newsfeed style feeds where refreshing the screen is actually necessary to see new content appear. In the general webpage use case though this seems less necessary. Am I crazy? Is everyone else constantly refreshing webpages?"	N

Basically the same issues reported by Adam Conway on XDA in this article: https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-snapdragon-vs-exynos/amp/

Watch, S22 Ultra, and Messaging- help and info appreciated	My S22U comes this week, and I had a few questions- So I've heard a few mixed thing about the way messaging was going with the new software and the approach Samsung is taking this time around- mainly some saying Google messages has totally taken over as the messenger, others saying that Samsung messages still exists but now is just a skin on google messages, and others saying it's not, but it doesnt really have a function anymore. Can anyone tell me what the actual status of this is? The reason I ask now instead of waiting is that I am considering picking up a S watch at the same time as the phone (watch is on sale), and this all ties into that- transitioning to next set of questions, anyone using a S watch with their 22U? How does messaging work with it, are you using Samsung or google messages? Do you have to be on LTE or connected via bluetooth, or can you still use the messaging app via only wifi if your accounts are linked? My goal is to be able to leave my phone in my backpack or coat pocket or desk while I'm at work, then just use the watch for messaging when I have to go to a different floor or department (I work at a big place with a big wifi net, so I'd always have wifi access). Any other noteworthy comments about 22U x S watch combo? Is it worth going to the watch 4 now, or should I wait a few months for the 5 to launch?

S22 Ultra Trade-in Credit	I recently purchased an S22 Ultra from samsung.com.

After I mailed in my Note 20 Ultra they tell me that it only qualifies for $440 trade in credit because I don't have a Get More plan.

Is AT&amp;T not accepting S22 Ultra’s bought from Samsung? 🤨	"Okay, so this was weird.  
I went to my local AT&amp;T store closest to my house with a Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra in hand.  I bought it unlocked when Samsung had a ton of promotions to buy the phone on their website.  
I’m there with my wife (we were upgrading her phone from a Note 8) and were told that they couldn’t upgrade her phone because of a bandwidth issue that was occurring with phones bought directly from Samsung.  Instead, they wanted to upgrade her existing phone to an S22 Ultra they had on sale (at full price) being displayed in the store. 
So I’m checking to see if anyone else has confronted this.  It sounds like complete BS since the rep had to talk to his boss to confirm they could take my pre-bought phone and use it to upgrade her existing one (data transfer, etc.)

Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra (SM-S908U1) - Unlocked model not compatible but on the whitelist?	So, I am a first responder and I have had a Firstnet phone line for about two years now. About a month ago, I stopped being able to call or receive calls on my OnePlus 7 Pro 5G. I went to the AT&amp;T store to see what was going on, and they told me that FirstNet does not support my phone model anymore and that I needed to buy a new phone. I was directed to their website and look at the list of phones that are compatible with the AT&amp;T network. On their website, they say that the newest Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra is compatible. So I bought it directly from Samsung since I am a long customer from them and I had a discount. I just got my phone (Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra) and now AT&amp;T is telling me that my phone is not FirstNet ready. When I checked the AT&amp;T whitelist, I can see that the model is on the list of phones that will work with the network. Firstnet wants to sell me another Galaxy S22 Ultra and recommended me to return the current one to Samsung. Nobody at the store is able to tell me what is the difference between the store-bought and company-bought phone?	N

Camera protectors for S22 Ultra	"Are you guys using camera protectors? If so what model? 
I never considered using them before but the S22U's cameras are huge protrusions that are begging to be scratched. They also trap dirt and the camera bezels are prone to chipping. With only a month's use, one of the bezels on mine already has a tiny chip showing silver color (on my burgundy S22U). I had to get a set of protectors.
I checked with my friend who has the iPhone 13 max and he had to get a protector for that phone's 3 gigantic lenses. It seems to be normal nowadays.
Here's what mine looks like with protectors on: https://ibb.co/kmrb3vW
I took the picture before putting on the last cover to show the height difference.
I'm using the Ringke Onyx case but this setup fits perfectly on my wife's Caseology Parallax case too.

Planning to purchase a S22 Plus on Amazon. Bad Idea or No?	Here in Canada, all the stores (and online) list the S22 plus as out of stock. For the same price, I can purchase it on Amazon. Official samsung and ship and sold by Amazon. Is it safe?	N
S22 Ultra delays are not only in the West	"I live in Malaysia. I ordered the S22 Ultra on the 3rd of March. I was already notified of the delays and was told that the phone will ship on the 28th of March and I accepted it. Comes 28th and no update from Samsung so I decided to wait 2-3 days more thinking that maybe they are just getting the shipment ready. Nothing after a whole week and contacting support was not helpful as they were pretty much reading off their repeated answers from a script. It's now the 3rd of April and I have had no updates whatsoever on the shipment status. 
Got a sweet deal on the phone tho. Came with a free galaxy watch 4 and Lamy safari pen."	N
How's battery life on your S22 ultra?	"When I used S20 ultra, I was used to charging the phone every two days. For S22 ultra, it seems like I charge it twice a day.
Anyone else experiencing this?
I lowered resolution to 1080p and refresh rate to 60hz. Now I can charge about once a day with moderate usage. Mine is the snapdragon variant."	N
Is AT&amp;T not accepting S22 Galaxy Ultra’s bought directly from Samsung? 🤨	"Okay, so this was weird.  
I went to my local AT&amp;T store closest to my house with a Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra in hand.  I bought it unlocked when Samsung had a ton of promotions to buy the phone on their website.  
I’m there with my wife (we were upgrading her phone from a Note 8) and were told that they couldn’t upgrade her phone because of a bandwidth issue that was occurring with phones bought directly from Samsung.  Instead, they wanted to upgrade her existing phone to an S22 Ultra they had on sale (at full price) being displayed in the store. 
So I’m checking to see if anyone else has confronted this.  It sounds like complete BS since the rep had to talk to his boss to confirm they could take my pre-bought phone and use it to upgrade her existing one (data transfer, etc.)
Any thoughts on this?"	N
Long time iOS user considering an S22 but not familiar with Android market. What to expect? Tips? etc.	"TLDR: Getting bored and want to spice up my choice of phone for once..
I've been with the iOS market for a long while and I'll be honest, seeing that same home screen for years has started to grow boredom in me. I love the simplicity of iOS and it just ""simply working"" with what I use it for. But as much as I enjoy it, I want to try something new so I've been considering trying out the S22 (don't know which model to even use) for this run as my 2-year upgrade plan is about to kick in. Not sure if I want to wait to see what the 14 brings (if any) or just to go ahead and pull the trigger.
My only complaint is that last time I used Android I felt like it was going out of its way to inconvenience me about doing the simplest of tasks. I don't know how much it's changed since then but that's all that stuck with me. I do like the fact I can switch from the, in my opinion, awful on-screen navigation buttons to the iOS's swipe instead.
So I guess what I'm asking is, what can I expect? Any tips? What kind of customizations are there? Etc etc."	N
What has your experience been with the Exynos S22 plus?	"Hi all,
It's getting towards that time where I need a new phone and I'm eyeing up the S22+ as an upgrade to my (falling apart) Oneplus 7 pro. Only problem is that I can only get hold of the Exynos variant.
So, Exynos users: what has your performance and battery been looking like? Is it a stuttery mess like some have suggested?"	N

These are decent options, and it's early in the game so I expect better ones to come out soon.
However, I have a beautiful sky blue S22 in a clear case, and I just don't think these fit well with it ([quick drawing](https://dl3.pushbulletusercontent.com/R77xNvzkvMlAFWpj4w8zGqlGcacoJYin/20220331_170809.jpg)). What do you guys think?"	N
Is s20+ to s22U a good move?	"I've been thinking about upgrading my s20+ since the launch of the s22U, but I'm looking for some input. 
I bought the s20+ secondhand so it's seen it's fair share of use, and it's showing it now too. 
I don't mind not having the SD card as I've never used it on my 128gb s20+ but overall, is it worth upgrading or just waiting it out until next year's model?"	N
Samsung S22 Ultra vs Note 20 Ultra	"Is this comparison between the Note 20 Ultra and the S 22 Ultra accurate ? Apparently the Note 20 Ultra maximum brightness is as much as the S22 Ultra's outdoor ? Also, why HDR videos look way better and brighter on the Note 20 Ultra than the S 22 ultra based on this comparison ? 
https://youtu.be/MpkhKrI_0Mc
I can see reasons why the speakers are not as good as the previous phones but i thought that display wise the S22 ultra would be hands down the best compared to the other phones.
I'll get my S22 ultra in a few days so I'm checking some reviews on the internet while I'm waiting."	N
Any guide to using the S22?	So, it's been 4 years using a Nokia 6.1, I decided to upgrade and get a S22 Ultra. It's great but I want to know everything I can do with this, all the neat features and helpful functions. Is there any guide for this type of stuff?	N
S22 only cases	"I'm trying to find a case for my S22 - seems most people (and thus recommendations) have the Ultra or +. 
I've used a clear OtterBox (for quite a while - been satisfied with drop protection but willing to look for other options) especially now as I just have matte black color so my normal clear case is no where near as interesting!
It seems you can get sturdy or fun and not much in between.  I like one on dbrand, not sure what the deal is with the buttons though?  Seems they added an overlay or something?  I take lots of screenshots so always pressing the buttons, don't want it to be super difficult.
Casemate has one I like as well.
Kickstands are intriguing, I wonder if you can add one (like with popsockets) if the case doesn't come with one?

Independent validation of Protect Battery option?	I generally understand the idea behind the Protect Battery option -- that avoiding stress caused by consistently charging to 100% can prolong battery life in the long run. However, older "wisdom" regarding battery health also suggested limiting charge cycles by charging and discharging more fully. Have you seen any recent independent testing reports comparing charging routines including PB and declaring a best practice? PB sounds logical, but so does the alternative.ThanksDanGalaxy S22 SM-S901U on Xfinity MobileSolved!Go to Solution.	N

Verizon S22 ultra not registering international	I am currently traveling outside of the USA. As soon as I landed I received a text about my plan and welcoming me. After that, lost service and have not regained it back. I have been here several times with my iPhone and no issues. Spent 6 hours with verizon on the phone from the hotel with no luck.Seen in other forums that it's due to verizon locking their phones. Is this true?	N
AOD running at 60Hz	Samsung can you please make AOD running at 30 Hz or 24Hz please to save battery life. S22+ battery has not been ideal for me. My S10+ battery is much better. But overall i still love the S22 series.	N
Carrier vs Unlocked 🤔	I don't like being tethered to any specific carrier, so many yrs ago, I began getting my devices directly from Samsung.I usually go with the unlocked versions, but recent have had some experience with what was initially a Verizon S20+ (I'm with T-Mobile), which revealed to me some cool features I'd not seen in my yrs using unlocked phones.In the past, I've heard that with carrier phones, you can't travel them internationally, amongst other things I don't love, but that didn't stop me from opting for a T-Mobile S22 Plus, bought directly from Samsung.Now my question is what really IS the difference between buying an unlocked phone directly from Samsung, vs buying the carrier version directly from Samsung? What're the benefits or limitations on either side? IS there any difference?I did notice when I put my T-Mobile SIM into this Verizon S20+, it had some updating to do and now shows as an unlocked device in About Phone. So that leads me to believe that it truly doesn't matter what carrier/unlocked option you choose, as ultimately, they'll all function the same way: Am I on track with that thinking, or am I missing something ?	N
Advance messages, RCS Messages	I know that unlocked phones will not work with Advance messages using Samsung messages, but the Advance messages shows up under settings until i make it my default app. and it also seems it don't work with Google Messages RCS messages.I'm wondering if flashing my carrier firmware from Sammobile will make this feature work with either one.

Samsung S22 Ultra cases	Anyone know of any good reliable grippy but not bulky phone cases that are in pretty good standing? I have one on my phone feels a little mediocre but meh?

Extremely disappointed	I was extremely excited when I saw the announcement from samsung saying the note series would be discontinued and the s pen would be coming to the s series. I used to love the note until the note 7 with the curved screen. The glass screen protectors never fit right and the screen broke way to easy. I pre-ordered the s22 plus. After waiting a month longer then I was originally told my phone arrived. When I pulled it out of the box I immediately realized it had no s pen. Upon contacting support I was told the only the ultra comes with the s pen. So I returned the s22 plus because the s pen was my only reason for upgrading. They tried to talk me into the ultra however, I will never purchase another phone with a curved screen.	N
Good Lock/icons	4 me the best customization phone is Samsung and period....and now with the implementation in the icon area that's is incredible good my phone looks sick....in the good way, you know.Practically we don't need 3rd party apps = more space in the phone.Great job Samsung Team!!!	N
50 dollar compensation offered for delayed orders	I know many ppl were offered 50 dollars for compensation as their orders got delayed. The ppl who contacted customer service.

However who else got the 50?	N

Latest version of Samsung Messages	Why won't my S22U allow me to install the latest version of the app? It's not in the store and when I check "About" it tells me I'm on the current version which shows 13.1.20.106. but the latest version is 13.1.26.10. my carrier is Fi.	N
S22 Ultra Trade-in	I haven't even received my S22 Ultra (I'm due to FINALLY receive it tomorrow) and Samsung sent me an email telling me I have until April 17th to return in my trade-in! They're giving me 13 days once I recieve the device.THAT'S CRAZY.If I remember correctly, it used to be up to 30 days before you had to return your trade-in. After Samsung verified the tracking info of the trade-in had been shipped within that time frame all was acceptable. But 13 FRICKING DAYS...NO WAY.I'm waiting until I know my new device is PROPERLY FUNCTIONING FOR AT LEAST A WEEK BEFORE I RETURN MY TRADE-IN AND 13 DAYS AIN'T GONNA CUT IT.😡	N

The code does not work says the email does not match this is the email that the promo code was sent to. I have talked to Samsung customer service 3 times about this and have been told, this is an issue with the Samsung web site and this would be elevated to tech support, and they would get back to me in 48 hrs. It has been 3 weeks and no word. What is going on no one has responded. I feel I have been swindled by Samsung. Anyone else having this problem	N

I will be thankful if got the answer from you guys, as always I thank you in advance.	N
I Noticed.	Thank you Samsung. I have always loved the futuristic curved edges of the Note but those unwanted side touches was a pain sometimes. Thank you for fixing this with the S22U. With more metal on the sides and a slightly smaller curve than the N20U, I haven't had the unwanted side touch issue, not even once. Well done 👏	N

Don't get UV glued glass screen protectors.	"Anyone going with UV glue tempered glass. I work in in a smartphone accessory and repair company( applied screen protectors on more than 10k phones and fixed more than 2k phones). What I have noticed sometimes that the glue becomes so hard that it's almost impossible to remove glued glass without scratches on screen. Once it took me 45 minutes to remove a cracked tempered glass. I had to heat it use alcohol, thread multiple times and finally got it removed. I also had a dome glass user and he somehow got glue under front speaker and Samsung didn't cover it under warranty. 
I suggest to go with invisible Shield gel screen protector which are self healing anti bacterial plus lifetime warranty. I was using on my s10 and note 10+ for 2 years and got it for my s22 ultra. And works fine. It might be expensive but there are cheap alternative on Amazon and AliExpress ( let me know if you need more suggestions) 
Some people might think that glass is hard it cracks so it provides better protection but it's not the case.. this tempered glass cracks really easily. On the other hand gel based they absorbs shock and also self heals if it has Minor scratches or dents. 
For case I suggest spigen tough armor cheap and reliable. I'm also getting some more gel based screen protector.. Normal clear and also privacy gel proctor I will post it once I get them."	N

Samsung S22 Ultra Stream hosting issue / worst phone	"Hello Community!
Is anyone else streaming on YouTube with their Samsung S22 Ultra (Exynos)? So host a livestream yourself with the smartphone itself and its cameras.
I had no problems before with my S10, now the stream flickers with the new device. Not the smartphone screen flickers, but the stream itself, so when you watch it. All observers have seen that. Even restarting the stream several times and changing the camera lenses did not help. Immediately after that I used iPhone and there was no problem.
So I conclude that the S22 Ultra has the problem.
I have the 512 GB version.
Does anyone know advice?
Im really dissapointed. Most expensive smartphone you can buy but has soooo many problems. Battery, crashes, stream issue, sound capture doesnt work sometimes.

Which Samsung apps are as good as (if different..) compared with Google? I understand that Samsung messages IS Google messages with a Samsung skin, so is functionally equivalent. What about the Samsung Camera app? 
My intention at first is to stay pretty much stock Samsung. Email  &amp; calendar &amp; photos will need to be Google, (I think...), although Outlook is supposed to be very good.

GPS strength/accuracy on Snapdragon?	"Hey everyone. Recently got my S22 Ultra (Snapdragon) a few days ago and it's been mostly pretty good. However one issue I've run into is when I'm using it to navigate with Google Maps on Android Auto I feel like it's messing up my location and lagging behind and thinking I'm on the parallel road etc pretty often. 
I'm using it in the exact same conditions (same car, same carrier, same areas I drive in etc) as my previous phone (iPhone 13 Pro Max) which had no issues whatsoever. 
I've seen reports on GPS issues with the Exynos model but couldn't find anything on if the Snapdragon variant had similar issues. Is this a common issue or do I have a dud? Any tips on getting better GPS in my car? Thanks!"	N
Restricting mobile data for specific apps?	"Previous Samsung Galaxy phones I've owned have had an option to restrict individual apps to WiFi only, i.e. prevent them from using mobile data.
However, I can't find a similar option anywhere on the S22.  It seems to have been replaced with the option to prevent *background* mobile data use, not restrict it altogether.  
Am I being blind here?"	N
Touchscreen only works with S-Pen?!	"A few hours ago a weird problem occured. After my S22 Ultra connected with my car, the touch screen isn't working anymore. For my fingers at least, the S-Pen works smooth as ever. Restarted the phone multiple times, which did not help.

We have to talk about the Battery	"Every day on this sub I see posts about how disappointing is the battery on the Samsung S22 series. 
You see I had always Android (and Windows) and I wanted to upgraded this year to the new S22+. I see daily your posts on how underwhelming the battery is and I don't know what to do. Spend a 1000€ for a smartphone that you have to charge twice in a day?
Even Samsung has not made an announcement on if they are going to fix it with an update or not. Some people are even saying that they have too many lags on the software. Every tech YouTuber has said that their experience with the battery was good (but not amazing). I don't know if it's just an Exynos problem (I live in Europe). But what I definitely know is that I don't want a smartphone that has the same strength as my current S8+.
It really is a shame for Samsung to have fooled so many customers. I am seriously considering on moving to iOS but I am very invested in the Google and Samsung ecosystem which I have zero experience with and I find many things weird. iPhone 13 Pro is the best rated smartphone right now and for some good reasons and MacBook laptops as well (which I have zero experience as well). 
Samsung really messed up in my opinion. 
P.S. I really hope that my post doesn't break any rules. Sorry in advance to the mods but I am really desperate for some help because I want to spend a thousand dollars wisely."	N
Newbie question about notifications from texting app	So apparently Textra no longer supports LED indicator notifications (wtf?!) but I was wondering if there was a super slick way to somehow bypass this and set up some sort of alternate notification system through the phone itself? Basically I just want to know when a text comes in when the phone is off.	N
Screen lights up every time I get a notification?	"Whenever I get a notification and my screen is off, it lights up and displays the lock screen, although I have edge lightning turned on. 
That didn't happen with my note 9. Instead I'd get the notification as a briefing and the edge lightning + Always on display would light up; I wouldn't be thrown into the lock-screen directly.
I have tried to search for a setting to turn it off, but couldn't find one. Can I turn off this feature so that only the edge lightning and the message is displayed, instead of the entire lock-screen?"	N
S22+ trade-in return fiasco	"I will try to explain this as simply and shortly as possible. I had an s20+ that Verizon told me I could trade in for an s22+ for ""free"" (plus all the fees of course). I thought it was a no-brainer so I took the trade-in and got the S22+. Once I got the s22+ I saw my account said the S22+ was $0 paid off so I was like ""oh that's weird"" and contacted support. I guess the trade-in counts over 36 months to where the trade in credit is ""paying off the phone"" $1049 split over 36 months. It is probably my fault for not seeing this somewhere in their contract but I just assumed a trade-in was a trade-in and that it wouldn't lock me into this phone for 3 years. If I want to upgrade before the 3 years is up, I will have to pay off my phone balance remaining because my ""trade-in"" covers the balance split over 3 years and not up front.
This was confusing to me but probably my fault for not figuring it out in the paperwork and whatnot. I also was wanting to return my S22+ now because I have had poor battery life and performance. When contacting Verizon support, they said I will have to ship back my S22+ at my own expense and then they have to inspect it first before I can get a new phone; there is also a $50 restocking fee. I then asked the person if I could get an iPhone 13 pro or pro max as a replacement and he was saying that if I return the S22+ it would result in a loss of promotional credit for the trade-in. I don't know if I am understanding that correctly but it sounds like if I return the S22+, I lose the trade-in credit and don't get back my old phone so I am stuck paying for a new one.
This whole situation just has me super confused. I'll probably go into a Verizon store to ask for their opinion before my 30-day return window is up.
My last message to them on the online support was:
""So like does the credit transfer to the new phone or not though if I return this one? sorry if im like being super dense"" 
It said not delivered so I think they ended the chat on me.
I guess my question for whoever is reading this is am I just an idiot or am I justified in being confused and a bit mad?"	N

S22 Ultra Wi-Fi connection drops (connected without internet)	I'm having issues with my S22 Ultra dropping the wifi connection (connected without internet).It will connect to the router for a few minutes, connection speed will be horrible, then it will drop wifi connection again, repeatedly. I have reset the network, reset router (though no other wifi devices are experiencing problems), powering off the phone, reboot in safe mode, tried a static IP, etc, all to no avail. Wondering if anyone else is having a similar issue. I've customized too much to do a factory reset.That said, I went to AT&T to get a replacement phone and my Wi-Fi worked fine in the store but they weren't running Wi-Fi 6 so I thought perhaps that had something to do with my issue.I'm running a NightHawk RAX50 with Wi-Fi 6 support and "Smart Connect" enabled which automatically select 2.4 GHZ or 5 GHZ under one SSID.I changed my router config to split both bands back out to two separate SSIDs and now the S22 Ultra work flawlessly under Wi-Fi 6 at 2.4 Ghz but still hit or miss when I manually switch to 5 Ghz. I've tried Wi-Fi 6 at 5 Ghz w/ and w/o OFDMA enabled and sometimes it works for a few hours but performance degrades and I have to switch back to Wi-Fi 6 over the2.4 Ghz bandSamsung, there appears there's an S22 Ultra issue with Wifi6 over the 5 Ghz band or a have a faulty device.

Samsung Breaks Promises Always	2 weeks ago a Samsung rep told me they can price match the S22 Ultra for me due to the website not working and I provided screenshots. I got his name and reference number to the chat. He promised saying that once the phone is shipped, they will issue a refund and I asked him 6 times to make sure this happens.... Guess what! The phone shipped and I call in to get that refund and I get an email saying that they can't issue the refund and that's their final answer. In the most rude way. Sick and tired of Samsung breaking their promises. I will be leaving Samsung and getting a new phone, they have the worst customer service I have ever seen.

Shipping delays	I have been using samsung products for years, Have order every note since the note 9, ordered tvs, monitors, my fiances phone with no issues. Yet getting my 1TB s22 ultra has been the biggest pain in the butt experience ever, this is coming from a guy who also works in IT! When chatting to customer service I am constantly lied to about when it will be delivered, and all they want to keep offering me is 5% rebate when the phone ships (if it ever does at this point) . I have gotten to the point I filed a complaint with the better business bureau about this. I don't buy the "due to how popular this phone is we are experiencing delays" Samsung has been doing this for too long to use that as an excuse.I know they don't give two craps but this will be my last samsung phone, may be my last samsung device. Given the other forums I have seen with others experiencing issues with getting their phones as well, this is just embarrassing.	N

Can't say much about battery life yet but I did the change because of the microlags and not for battery life gains.

It's on my 3x rear lens which is the smallest of the rear cameras, so I am not sure how it would be that particular one. It's the most insignificant one other than for portrait shots so yeah.
I've done a lot of test shots and it doesn't seem to affect photos, but I know it can get affected to a very microscopic amount.
You need a very bright light to see only a small scratch from a certain angle, so hopefully it's not an issue for the next 2-3 years, or I may upgrade next year, depends. I definitely wouldn't be fixing it just for that small 5-7mm scratch.
I'm afraid of scratching it even more just from normal use and have been cautious with it ever since. So yeah, what you guys think?"	N

Tempered glass screen protector: worth it?	"Hi guys,  
I'm the superproud new owner of a S22 Ultra 256 in burgundy! I love this beast to death, but I only have one doubt left.  
I already equipped it with a plastic screen protector (amfilm-like, got it on Amazon for a few bucks) and with a tempered glass camera protector that doesn't appear to mess with the amazing pics this phone can snap, and of course I topped it with a Spigen ultra hybrid case to combine protection from drops with relative thinness and safety.  
Since it's the first time that I own a phone with a curved screen, I was wondering if it would actually be wise to install a tempered glass screen protector, like a Mowei ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N25qPthKw6U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N25qPthKw6U)) or a Whitestone Dome ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXtYM6c6kZY&amp;t=131s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXtYM6c6kZY&amp;t=131s)), to better protect the display in case of impacts.  
What do you think? Are tempered glass screen protectors an actual protection with curved screens? Am I already protected enough with the Spigen ultra hybrid case + the plastic screen protector, or would adding a tempered glass protector make the difference in case of a drop?  
Any help would be MASSIVELY appreciated!"	N

DBrand Atomic Grip Case VS UAG Monarch Kevlar edition	"I finally got the dbrand atomic grip case for my S22 Ultra today. Didn't expect this to be way thinner than the original grip case that you can put skins on which I had for my previous phone. The case fits the phone like a glove. Individual cut outs for the cameras which are ever so slightly higher than the cameras. Lip protection in front is good. If it weren't for the grippy texture feels like you don't have a case at all which is amazing! Best case in terms of feel that I have ever had hands down but don't think this would provide a ton of protection in case of a drop. No one on YouTube has conducted any drop tests with unlike the original grip case which had multiw people do drop tests on concrete.
I have been using the UAG monarch kevlar edition. The look and protection you get from it is second to none.I didn't feel it was too bulky since this is thinner than OtterBox with similar protection.case looks so good with red accents and kevlar back make it so unique. I wish the UAG monarch was grippier and had a better feel. I can't decide which one to use going forward. 
I wish I was able to get the original grip case which would have been a happy medium. Can't get over how good the phone feels but Atomic grip case is just a tad too thin and flimsy specially on the sides doubt this could stand an unlucky drop. I know this is very grippy but all it takes is one drop. The OG grip case would have been a better balance since it still had a great feel. Not to mention the customization (even if this is not a big deal for me).
Wish I had a clear cut winner but I'm more torn now than ever. Good problem to have I guess. Might lean toward the protection the UAG monarch provides considering the astronomical price of this phone. Dbrand is so good, it has ruined the feel of the UAG case.
Hope this helps someone else in making their decision between 2 cases."	N

Unethical tactics by Samsung Sri Lanka	Samsung Sri Lanka opened pre orders for the S22 devices on the 4th of March. They advertised a price of 320,000 LKR for the S22 Ultra.Within hours of starting pre orders, I confirmed my pre order by making a 5,000LKR advance as requested by the dealer Softlogic Max.However, delivery was being delayed past the promised date and suddenly I was informed that the price is now 385,000 and the Buds2 that was part of the pre order deal will no longer be given. They cite forex fluctuations for the exorbitant price increase.Forex risk is factored into the price anyway and this should not be a penalty for the customer. If SAMSUNG Sri Lanka committed to a price when taking pre orders, they should honour that price. If they were unsure of the price, they should not have taken pre orders in the first place.After entering into an agreement with a customer to give a product at a price point and then to simply go back on the word and impose a 100,000 LKR impact on the customer is atrociously unethical.I have been a loyal Samsung customer since the Note 2 and this is the first time I'm experiencing this kind of behaviour from the company.I'm hoping for an intervention from Samsung global and a fair solution.Solved!Go to Solution.

Lockscreen laggy and suffering. Who else ?	HelloI have a S22 (Exynos) with the last April update.

For example when there is music the player has difficulty to display. The animation on the lockscreen is laggy.It's just unbearable especially since it's the only time the phone rambles apart from that once the phone is unlocked I have no performance concerns.I'm well in Maximum processing speed mode of course.

S22 speaker Distortion and Crackling - FIX	FIXED for my s22... Unpair BT Devices. Recently had the problem after having my phone for a little over 1month. I noticed it first started to happen after I used my Bluetooth ear buds. It wouldn't disconnect after I put my buds back in charging case. The pairing was brought over from my old phone (s20) using Smart Switch. You can tell when in Paired Devices it says, 'Connection from Previous Phone'. Unpair any device that still says 'Connection from Previous Phone ', restart. If you don't have one of those entries, unpair all devices, restart the phone, then Pair if you still wanna use that device. Hope this helps.	N

It doesn't cover the lenses, just fits around them and fills in all the gaps my case (Spigen Tough Armor) leaves, which is great. 
Only problem is the adhesive is kinda weak. Granted I've been fiddling with it a bit, and have another, but is there any phone-safe adhesive I can buy if it comes loose?

Power Savong Settings Help	"Hello,
I hope this is the right place for this, but my Galaxy S22+ keeps shutting off the Power Saving AND the Adaptive Power Saving by itself.
I've been trying to figure out why and the best I have so far is when I charge it at the end of the day. Still, I'm getting sick of checking on it all day and having to turn them back on all the time.
I'm keeping them on to save battery so if someone knows of a better way to save battery, I'm all ears, cause I'm not that tech savvy, I just did some lite reading when I first got the phone.
Thanks in advance and I'll give up votes to the helpful peeps."	N
Launcher bug after Aprile patch	"After the April patch my homescreen has bugged closing animations. Did this happen to anyone else?
The April patch also increased the UI stutters in general but somehow deleting cache and data of the AoD mostly fixed it (even if I never had it on in the first place). Battery life got worse too.
I reported the homescreen bug in the Samsung Members app and they just said to backup and reset my phone if I encounter a bug after a OS update. Worthless like this phone.

I m planning to move to a S22 coming from an Iphone X with very low battery and some pixels dead. I have read a lot of different reviews about s22 and I would like to ask here for thoose who already have the phone.

Is there any other negative point on this phone?

Case Fitment	"Has anyone else found that the tolerances on Samsung made cases are on the looser side?
I had a frame cover for my S22+. I immediately noticed that I could squeeze the sides, top, and bottom and there was a decent amount of play in the case. I reinstalled it a few times, and it actually seemed to make it worse. Thinking I received a defective one, I swapped it out. Same thing. After two weeks, there was a good amount of dust/lint buildup not just on the sides of the case where it meets the screen, but somehow had also managed to get between the back of the phone and case.
My rubber silicone case arrived today, and I can slightly move it up and down when the phone is inside of it.
The leather case is somehow still on backorder from when I pre ordered, so I can't speak to that one yet. 
Not a huge deal, but I'm just curious. I've always stuck with OtterBox cases so this isn't really convincing me to branch off from those."	N

Galaxy S22 Ultra - UAG Monarch Kevlar vs Spigen Tough Armor - Which case will protect better - discussion	"I was wondering about those two cases, I am looking for best possible protection of S22 Ultra while retaining usability.
I have ordered already UAG and after receiving it and taking a good look at it I am not so sure it is a good protection for a S22 Ultra.
First the case is very hard on back its layer of metal+kevlar(?)+plastic and I fear if dropped on the back the energy from fall would go directly to glass panel and might even shatter it. Also the metal screws on back, I thought its just marketing for better look but they actually put there metal screws there that does nothing else that taking energy from fall directly into phone itself, granted there is maybe 1-2mm and it doesnt touch phone but still it looks dangerous. And lastly, the Kevlar material seems to loose tiny fiber plastic when touching it, yay more microplastic in life...
And seems Spigen would be better choice since its a 3 part material - plastic then gum then shock absorbant mat before the case touches smartphone. Also I had good experience with this case on my old Samsung galaxy S10+ and few other smartphones before it. I even did small unplanned test when had very bad day and threw it on the concrete wall, the phone jumped from wall to floor and on the floor it even did it few times slowly loosing throw energy, tiny scratch on the case and not a single even tiny damage on the phone, so well the air cushion technology works huh."

Colors on screen flicker with adaptive refresh rate	"Hi guys,
I noticed that when I have adaptive refresh rate ""on"" and at some brightness values (screenshot as example), the greys and blacks on screen flicker for a bit. I tried to set a fixed refresh rate and the flicker stops. 
It happens when I stop touching the screen and the refresh rate drops and, if I touch it again and the refresh rate goes up, it happens as well. 
I already tried various refresh rates and color modes. 
Maybe if there's more people with this issue, we could report this to Samsung and hope they will fix it.

GENUINE Samsung - BLACK - USB Type C Headset Adapter	Do you want OUTSTANDING AUDIO? Then grab an Original Samsung USB Type C Headset Jack Adapter to 3.5mm Audio Aux Headphone to go with you S22 Ulta.I'm using this with Shure 846 Earphones. The sound will blow you away. Since it's AUTHENTIC SAMSUNG you get to experience the Samsung AKG DAC. Adjusting the volume to 50% provides you with an earth shattering and absolute pristine sound reproduction that takes this device to a new level.You can search the internet to find out where to grab it. It's the exact same version as the white version albeit in BLACK. Everything is identical, product number, description and packaging. I've put the boxes side by side and there's no difference except for the product number signifying the white version. Even the hologram is AUTHENTIC SAMSUNG.This is obviously an international version which is fine with me.They're also available on eBay. You receive a GENUINE AUTHENTIC SAMSUNG adapter in a SAMSUNG FACTORY SEALED BOX. You can scan the UPC Code and verify it's an AUTHENTIC Samsung Accessory.The sound is ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL! The sound reproduction is mind blowing. You get use of the proprietary SAMSUNG AKG DAC. This is truly the BEST SOUND you'll ever hear from a mobile device and it makes the S22 ULTRA even better!	N

Lacking LHDC support - Its been baked into Android since Android 10	I received my preordered S22 Ultra yesterday and I am disappointed to see Samsung has refused to enable the LHDC support that's been baked into android since android 10.

Unlock T-Mobile branded paid in full from Samsung USA S22Ultra	"Hello,
Purchased T-Mobile branded S22 Ultra from Samsung USA. Paid in Full.

Called in, spoke to a clueless rep, got passed to a supervisor who told me I had to provide the original invoice from Samsung via email / .pdf. Took path of least resistance and sent invoice within 5 minutes of ending call to supervisor's email address. Supervisor called back and said ""all good"" phone would be unlocked in a couple of days.

S Pen longevity + replacement and screen protector style.	"Just a few questions as I'd like to make the most of this phone. Currently loving this phone easily more than any other I've ever had, that includes my first smartphone and my first iPhone which were pretty revolutionary experiences.
So I noticed there's a soft tip on my S Pen and I've been using it for work (office and excel) and light gaming. I have a TPU 'self healing' screen protector which honestly I dont put much stock into but am not much a fan of glass protectors. I notice that when I type or draw etc it leaves lines that pop out over time, is this something that will be a case of being; over time, they will no longer pop out so much and I'll notice scratching/a patch around the keyboard area where the pen gets used a lot? I'm assuming a glass protector excels where the TPU doesn't there?

switched from a Pixel 6 Pro "phone"	"Back around Thanksgiving my S9+ was starting to fail so I figured I'd give the much loved Pixel line a try. Ended up dumping the Pixel 6 Pro after 4 months of bugginess. It's a phenomenal camera, but leaves a lot to be desired as a phone:
Dropped calls, battery drains 15+% over night, woke up to no service at least once a week, have to toggle airplane mode off/on to get a signal again. 5G download speed about the same as 4G from my previous S9+.
I suspect these are due to the poor radio. My house is behind a hill with some houses and trees between me and the nearest tower, so not the best 5G environment. I have gotten ~475M down while out and about, so my geographically challenged house has something do to with the poor 5G performance.
Besides the 5G issues, never got a voicemail notification until after a reboot; had to set it down 2-3 times on the wireless charger before it starts charging; music app randomly stops working when connected to my car; Smart Lock not very good at on body detection or home location.
It's only been a week with an S22 Ultra, but no dropped calls; 5G speed at least 2x the P6P at home; gets ~575M down the same spot the P6P got 475; Smart Lock works much better; only have to set it down once on the same wireless charger; ...
Maybe the S22U isn't ""pure"" Android, but it works..."	N

With the Samsung restoration from Smart switch and then the Google backup restoration, what is the best way to integrate those two restorations, which one do I do first, etc etc?
As I recall from a couple of years ago when I did a new phone setup, I think I did the Google restoration (Which can only be done during first setup of the phone right?)
And then after that completed I think I did the Samsung Smart switch restoration... It's been a while so I can't exactly remember what was the best way..

How to Stop Apps from Rearranging?	"My apps in my dock and in my folders on the homescreen are rearranging themselves randomly.  I am reorganizing them back to my preferred order at least once per day.

Stop turning off fast charging and charging to 85%	"This doesn't help your battery unless you're keeping your phone for 5+ years and even then that'd negligible.  This is a popular myth that has been going on for years and thought I would just dispell some of it.
Modern fast charging tech does so safely and reliably. It doesn't kill you're battery and if it's on you lose close to maybe 1-3٪ a **YEAR** more battery capacity then if you kept it off.
Overall if you pay $1k+ for a phone use it to its fullest capabilities. Stop micromanaging and nerfing the capabilities of your phone"	N

I called Samsung to tell them to change the package address, but they said it will be attempted to be delivered 3 times, and then refunded.
Wtf? I waited 2 months just for it to be refunded and not delivered?
Called,FedEx, they said they can't hold package at office or intercept package due to ""sender security reasons"" 
I told Samsung what if someone else at the address steals it it. They said you can file a claim and we will know who signed it, as if signatures mean anything LOL.
Samsung support was never helpful for anything during this entire ordeal. 
What do I do?
TLDR: Samsung shipped package one day after I already moved. FedEx can't hold or intercept package. Called Samsung, all they said is it will be attempted 3 times and then refunded and I will get no phone at all after a 2 month wait. I asked what if someone steals it at the address, they said you can file a claim and they'll have a (fake) signature."	N

PSA don't buy directly from Whitestone	"I'm avoiding Whitestone in the future, and I suggest others do the same. I recommend amFilm instead. If you do buy Whitestone, do it through a place with good buyer protection, like Amazon. (PayPal's buyer protection isn't good enough!) It'll make your life a lot easier when you go make that return.
With my last phone, I had good experiences with Whitestone's glass screen protector, so I figured I'd go with them again this time around. I ended up buying directly from their site, a terrible mistake.
# Part 1: Doesn't work with fingerprint reader after three install attempts
I've heard that the fingerprint reader can be finicky, so I watched both installation videos on their website several times before doing the install. No luck, though. After the install, I went to re-register my fingerprints, but the reader kept saying, ""Cover the entire fingerprint sensor."" I e-mailed support. They came back with a list of suggestions, so I took off the screen protector, cleaned it off, and reinstalled it, carefully following all instructions and suggestions. Still no luck with the fingerprint reader. Rinse and repeat for a third install attempt. No dice.
I've since bought and installed the amFilm glass screen protector. The fingerprint reader works beautifully on the first install.
# Part 2: Customer service non-responsive
It was clear that the product did not work as advertised, so I e-mailed customer service for a refund. They came back with their (not-so-generous) warranty: for $15, I can get another piece of glass to try again. When I insisted on the refund, I got no response, even after replying to them several times.
# Part 3: PayPal resolution laughable
Eventually, I escalated to PayPal and was offered a full refund. To get it, all I had to do was to ship the product to Whitestone's **South Korea** headquarters, in **like-new** condition! The shipping cost from the US to Korea is 2–3 times the price of the screen protector. Not only that, I'd already told them that I've used the product, only to discover that it doesn't work as advertised. They're clearly dragging their feet on the refund. Seems like their [F rating](https://www.bbb.org/us/ca/los-angeles/profile/cell-phone-accessories/whitestone-dome-glass-1216-1262368) at the Better Business Bureau is well-deserved."	N

Its snappy overall I just like the design over the A32 and S10.
How are you feeling about your phone? For the people who've had it recently or spent a couple weeks with it now. Are you enjoying it or do you regret it? Do you wish you got a different version like the base or the plus or the ultra? Is it an upgrade over your previous phone?

S22+ Exynos or Snapdragon	"Hello,
I plan to get S22+ 256 GB and I live in a region where I can only get the Exynos version (SM-S901B/DS) (or pay extra for an imported Snapdragon variant (SM-S9010/DS), the warranty on the device is not important to me). 
Is there any significant difference in performance, battery or camera this year between these two processors? 
Honestly, I'm asking for advice since I'm doing an upgrade from S9+ Exynos which that year was so much inferior to Snapdragon. Another thing that discourages me is that only Europe gets Exynos, and even Samsung's homeland doesn't get this version.
I'm looking for a phone that will be good for me for the next 2-3 years, so what is the best option for me, stick to an Exynos or import a Snapdragon version?"	N

Automatically disable AOD when phone is upside down?	" Hi all, 2 days ago I finally received my S22 ultra. My previous phone, a Note 9, had this feature where I could turn the phone around and lay it flat on its screen and it would automatically turn off the AOD because it wouldn't be visible with the screen laying flat on the table anyway.
I always felt like this preserved a surprising amount of battery, and it even sped up charging for me (could be a placebo effect, but I'm fairly sure it actually worked!)
For some reason however, my S22 ultra does not disable the AOD when it lays flat on its screen. Any idea where I could enable this feature? It feels like a waste of energy to keep the AOD on while it won't be visible anyway."	N

"I am BRAND NEW to the whole bixby routines thing and I'm trying to figure it out, but I feel like im trying to decipher an encrypted message. 😆 I was wondering if there was a way to delay/turn off charging until/at a certain time. For example, I usually go to bed around 11:30 p.m. and then put my s22 on my wireless charger until I wake up at 6:30. So, my question is can I somehow set a bixby routine to either delay charging until around 3 a.m. or turn it off when it's fully charged. That way it's not continually charging all night. 
Also, can I set a B.R. for when someone messages me, either on Facebook messenger or Google messages to send a reply message that I'm driving? 
I did try to figure this out before I posted this, but I am just totally lost and confused when it comes to the bixby routines. 😕

The April Update is really good.	"S22 Plus SD. For those waiting for the April update or for those who have just received it, trust me it gets better. The heating issues are much less than before, and the battery life has greatly improved. See below:
https://imgur.com/a/Vwv8kkv
Not that it was bad earlier, it was fairly decent. But now it's improved.
The only thing I did was, after the update, I wiped my cache partition (although I don't think this is required), and used good guardian to optimise all my apps through the module.
Y'all can try these and see if it helps."	N
should i risk buying s22 plus or not?	"Im sorry in advance because i saw the amount of people talked about it already but this is alot of money and i need help. Im talking of course about the battery, so many people say it sucks, some say it's good, i dont see YouTubers say it's bad, this is just so confusing tbh lol
Should i just get the s21 ultra instead since its similar price? Or should i risk getting s22 plus and hope that they fix it with updates maybe"	N

Stock Samsung Messages App Inadvertently Installed	"I have two messages app right now. The one that came with the phone (the Google Messages app with the Samsung reskin) and the traditional Samsung Messages App. 
Here's how it appeared. If you pull up the Finder, you can search not just apps and settings, but also messages. If you tap on one of the messages searched, then the Finder app opens the traditional Samsung Messages app, not the Google version. 
I can now make any of the two apps the stock messaging app. The traditional samsung app doesnt have the features that the google app offers. For instance, there is no RCS setting. 
So odd. Can you guys replicate this?"	N
Samsung SmartSwitch doesn't copy app data?	"I got a new S22 that I'm moving to from a V30. In the past I remember Google/Android giving the option to restore all of my apps and data from Google Drive backups, but the S22 is pushing me towards their SmartSwitch app and I don't see any other options. 
This would be fine, except it seems to be installing fresh apps and not copying over any app data. So no app settings, no notes from ColorNote, no tracking numbers from my package tracking app, no wallets in Cryptoport, etc.  None of these apps are password protected. 
Is this normal? I thought surely not but Samsung support says they can't transfer any data from third-party apps. I don't remember having this struggle before."	N

Phone customization questions | battery life &amp; performance report after 1 month | speaker and fingerprint scanner issues	"S22+ Exynos, 8gb 256gb
Hello everyone,
I have some questions regarding phone customization, battery life and issues I experienced.
1)Phone customization
What apps are you guys using for phone customization? Something like nova launcher or? I've recently found out about this thing called good lock, but as you can see from the phone version I am from europe and therefore region locked :(. There are 2 substitues, launchers for modules on play store called fine lock and nice lock? What is the difference between the two? Do they consume a noticeable amount of battery? What if I dont update the modules but update the android OS, bugs incoming or? Any other cool apps for phone customization, live wallpapers, home/lock screen etc.?
Is there an app or a widget that is a calendar but has notes/reminders. I have some bills I have to manually pay every month.  And I am wondering if there is such a thing that can be put on a home screen or a lock screen. So when I pay the bill for example I can just check it off or something and it automatically renews for the next month.
2) Battery life &amp; performance
120hz on | bluetooth, location  and sync. are off | low brightness | adaptive battery off | everything else is default | light use mostly ( emails, phone calls, messaging etc.), web browsing | 4g,wifi mixed usage (neighborhood has poor reception so yeah... 2 bars 70% of the time)
Right now my phone is on 68% with 2h30min screen on time 7h screen of time, 4G, google play services battery consumption 4,4%, one home ui 3,3%
When I got the phone in the first 2 weeks I was averaging 4-5h screen on time and round 15-17h screen off time. Seeing all the posts from the guys with base 22s  getting 7-8 screen on time, and me getting kinda jelaous xD. I did a factory reset before updating to april patch. Now I get 6-7 screen on time with 16-17h screen of time.
No performance issues, everything is buttery smooth, no overheating issues, phone doesnt even get warm while charching. Playing some games like pokemon unite/csr2 it barely gets warm to touch and thats it.
Although I noticed it discharges from 100-90 pretty fast. I mean I still get like 40-50minutes of scren on time while web browsing idk, it might be just me being paraoind for no reason.
Regarding google play services, I've cleared cache, disbled location and sync, I did everything I found on recent or older posts from reddit. And I cant get it to use less than 6-8% per charge. Phone still lasts me a day and half easy with my use (100%-25%).
3) Issues
I only have 2 issues. Finger print scanner works 70% of the times. Sometimes I have to unlock the phone using the PIN number, because I get so triggered after it doesnt register in more than 3,4 attempts. I added the same finger like 5 times. I am using the official samsungs film screen protector.
Speaker issue appeared after installing the april patch. I think it might be a software issue, because the speakers work fine on high volumes no crackles and pops. My issue is that my speaker next to the TYPE C port pops or crackles before the sound effect of changing the phone mode from silent,vibrate to ring. Same thing happens sometimes when playing some games. I didnt notice any pops or crackles on notifications sounds, youtube videos etc.
EDIT: 
3) Regarding the speaker thump/pop. Seems like it only happens on galaxy system sound option, changing it to other 3 fixes the issue."	N
Visual voicemail question	"Have an unlocked S22 Ultra I'm using on AT&amp;T. When I had the AT&amp;T variant (returned due to AT&amp;T hijacking RCS), I had the visual voicemail button\tab integrated into the default phone app. This doesn't seem to be the case with the unlocked version. 
Curious if there's anything I can do to get the visual voicemail tab back, or if I just have to deal with not having it."	N
Silent Mode - Expect specific notification?	"for the past 5 years my phone has lived in silent mode, the vibration is enough to notify me an most of the time its none urgent / important. 
However i recently got a Nest Doorbell, Is there anyway to leave my phone on Silent apart from when the nest doorbell is triggered? 
In other words can the phone be left on silent an have an exception for a specific app / notification to play  out aloud"	N

Could Bloatware Actually Speed up Phone?	"Just a though Im having. Have had my unlocked S22+ for a couple weeks. Have no issues with battery life, camera is nice, wish the screen was better...pretty typical new phone feeling I have every 3 years.
One thing I noticed though is that after I did a thorough walkthrough of my apps and removed most the Samsung and Google apps and disabled all the Bixby services I could, and turned off animations (hate the scroll bouncing feature) I noticed that the phone doesn't seem nearly as snappy as when I turned it on. It's that slight lag that usually shows up a year or two into phone ownership, not a huge deal, but noticeable. Almost everything from opening an app to bringing up the keyboard feels like it takes an extra second to process and I don't have much running. 
I don't want to get conspiratorial and say this is some kind of sabotage to make you use Bixby and the other bloat (we all know phone makers never do stuff like that 🙃), but I'm wondering if there is actually useful stuff that speeds up the phone that I disabled along with what I perceived as bloat. Thoughts?"	N

Note 20 vs. S22 Ultra	"Thinking about updating my Note 9, and 5G is one of the main reasons for me. That said, is the 5G modem actually better in a newer gen phone than the Note 20? Better reception, speeds, compatibility with carriers (T-Mobile), or battery efficient?

Torn between ZF3 and S22 ultra	"Just airing out my thoughts because we've all made some comprimize to be Samsung's guini pigs with the fold series. I've had the ZF3 since launch and have had issues with my business line. Ive been using Digits by T-Mobile, which has been unreliable. I ordered an S22 ultra to get dual SIM (dual sim ZF3 not available in US) so i would not have to carry 2 phones. I've put my ZF3 down for a few days to get out of the fold to really give the s22 Ultra a solid shot.
After picking up my ZF3 again I am unsure I want to trade it in. The ZF3 screen is just incredible and hard to walk away from. And the spoud quality S22 ultra is not even comparable to the deep sound of the ZF3. On the other hand the S22 ultra has the dual sim, significantly better battery (it has not even optimized yet, so i expect this to be even better), and the 108mp camera blows the ZF3 out of the water.
I'm torn. I need to decide in 5 days whether to trade in the fold or return the s22 ultra. I love the camera and S-pen on the s22, and rumor is that the ZF4 will have improvements in both of these areas. If ZF3 had dual sim in the US this would not even be a discussion.
Should I stick it out with my ZF3 and hope ZF4 gets E-sim at the bare minimum or trade it back and hold onto the S22 ultra?"	N
[question] I purchased the s22u unlocked from best buy to use on verizon	I've called and had my line reprovisioned. Only after having that done I now seee the uw logo next to 5g. So I have an iPhone 12 pro and bow s22u. The iPhone which is locked to verizon shows 5g while I'm at home. The s22u will show 4glte for and 5g will appear for a few min then go back. Why is the newer phone Antenna modem not as good as an older iPhone modem? First unlocked device so I'm just trying to make sure I get the most put of this new phone.	N
S22U on 5GUW	"Here in Nashville, I’ve seen 5GUW exactly once on my new S22U. I see 5G quite a bit on it and if I have good signal strength, I get great speeds such as 400 down and 50 up with a 12ms ping.
I read somewhere where unlocked phones don’t show the UW icon like Verizon phones and I wonder after the Mar. 31 update maybe UW isn’t showing up on Vz phones either?
I haven’t checked bands in these locations mainly because I’ve been driving at the time but I wonder if anyone else has noticed this. My 5G speeds on my pixel 4a 5G always were pretty damn bad. 
Either way I am pretty happy with this beast so far"	N

TERRIBLE Exynos 2200 S22 Ultra Battery Life	"Hi guys. 
So I recently switched from iOS to Android via the S22 Ultra and so far I am loving it. 
The one thing I cannot get used to coming from an iPhone 13 Pro, however, is the abysmal battery life. I am getting around 3 hours of SOT and I have had the phone since launch. 
I used smart switch, use an adaptive refresh rate with full screen resolution and like 60% brightness. I get that I cant expect 10 hours of SOT with these settings enabled but… 3?!? Is this normal?! 
I am seeing some posts complaining about 6 hours of SOT! Is there something I’m missing? I don’t want to go through and disable all the features which make this a great phone… but if the battery life is really this bad on Samsung phones I am going to switch back to iOS as soon as humanely possible - because as much as I enjoy it, in some ways even more than iOS, its absolutely essential that my phone, you know, *actually lasts a full day with moderate use.*
Sorry to rant but I am frustrated. Any advice will be appreciated."	N
iPhone 13 Pro Max or Galalxy S22 Ultra?	"Hey everyone.
I've been thinking of upgrading from my Note 10+ recently. Been absolutely enjoying the large screen, and expandable storage for the past 2+ years, but I think the upgraded performance, 120hz screens and cameras of the newer phones had me considering upgrading to something a bit newer.
I've been mostly using Samsung devices since 2011. I've recently bought a iPhone XS just to try out iOS again (after using an 8+ and not liking it at all) and the OS has gotten a lot better lately imo, so I don't really mind either Android or iOS anymore.
I like the S-pen on my Note 10+ but honestly, I don't use it that often anymore.
I've been watching reviews on both the iPhone 13 Pro Max and the S22 Ultra, and frankly, I can't decide between them at all.
I just want a phone that's reliable and something I won't regret purchasing later on. (These are both expensive devices, after all) I've noticed the battery life and speakers are ever so slightly better on the iPhone, while day-to-day performance and cameras can go either way, and the screen &amp; advanced features being better on Samsung.
I'm scared the S22 Ultra won't be a massive upgrade over my Note 10+, and the removal of the expandable storage is a bit of a downgrade to me personally.
I like both of the phone's design, but I've gotten a bit sick with the curved edges lately. It makes installing stuff like screen protectors an absolute nightmare.
I'm currently using a Galaxy Watch 4 as well, so while I don't mind trying out an Apple Watch, that's something else I'll have to do at a later point. The GW4 has been excellent so it'll be hard to give it up when switching.
I need some advice with someone who owns, or at least throughly experienced using both phones, possibly list of few of their pros and cons, and weither they think it's a good idea to either consider switching or to stay on Samsung. I know that the purchase decision is still up to me, but some useful advice would be pretty cool. Thanks.
Edit: I forgot to mention. Samsung offers a $500NZ student discount (no trade in required) on the S22 Ultra where I live, so it makes it almost $500 cheaper than the iPhone. I don't mind paying more for the iPhone, but I thought I'd mention it."	N
why does my Samsung Galaxy S22+ apply face smoothing on pictures, even when face smoothing is off?	Is there a way to fix this? Faces look like oil paintings when using the standard camera app and the Expert RAW app. The face smoothing feature in the standard camera app is off, is there another setting I should change to fix this?	N
Just got the S22 Ultra as an upgrade from my Note 9. I am very happy in some ways but at the same time, very dissapointed in others.	"I've had this phone for about a week now and I gatta say in most aspects, it's a huge improvement from my old note 9 which I also loved. That said, there are certain features that I am really bothered that I can't find on this device. Why in the world is there not a status LED to show when I have a notification? Why do I have to set my notification type to ""brief pop-up"" to enable edge lighting that doesn't even last long enough to matter? Why can I not customize the font and style of the lock screen number pad like I could on my note 9? Why did I have to install a 3rd party app to customize the type of vibration from notifications by individual app? I've never understood why customization features are not avaliable for every single device after they were first developed. The keypad isn't a big deal since I use the fingerprint, but not being able to tell if I have a notification without touching my phone at all is very annoying.
I have tried looking it up to see if I just wasn't looking hard enough in the settings for these options but as far as I can tell, they simply do not exist on this device which I think is unreasonable for a flagship phone.
Does anybody know of a way I can get these features or something similar through a 3rd party or do I just have to live with the change?"	N
I am returning my S22 Ultra	So, for the past few years I always carry my work phone and my personal phone. My work phone is a company issued iPhone my personal was always an Android phone. I was upgraded to an iPhone 13 Pro Max a few months ago and thought it was time to switch my Note 20 Ultra to the S22 Ultra and man I was wrong. This phone is so sluggish. I’ve tried multiple things to help it. Gaming performance is just bad. Even comparing that to my Note. I am very disappointed in Samsung with this launch. I can’t believe they would sell this phone for over $1,000 and expect it to compare to their old Note lineup and it’s not even close to the speed of the iPhone. I’m sorry guys this iPhone blows it out of the water. It even blows my Note out of the water. I am kind of sad Android is this far behind to Apple. I love Android and what it can do but if this is the best Android phone for 2022 it’s going to be a bad year.	N

I have wired iem and was looking at bt adapter fiio (2pin 0.76 Mm), I looked and went cool they have aptx adaptive 24/96khz.

Thinking of upgrading from S10+ to S22 Ultra	"Hi guys,
So my S10+ screen smashed recently and I'm in a market for a new phone. I'm currently considering the S22 Ultra and most likely be getting it from WondaMobile to get the model with SD as I live in Ireland and we get Exynos model. Also the price works out cheaper than buying direct from Samsung here. Most of the time I get my phone from Hong Kong but I haven't gone back so will be ordering through these guys.
My main concern was hearing a lot of issues with battery life. I'm not sure if some of them were exaggerations or real concerns. I've read people having only 6 hours battery life with the phone on idle and then some other saying after few weeks the phone adapts to usage and will last longer etc. It's hard to tell what 
I'm mostly at home as I work remote so battery life wouldn't be a huge worry but 6 hours does sound quite short.
For people who have S22 Ultra could you whole heartily recommend it or would it be a phone to skip?"	N

Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra - UAG Monarch Kevlar vs Spigen Tough Armor - Which case will protect better ?	"I have bought both of them to compare them and decide which one to keep.
And honestly still I am not sure.
The UAG have thicker back than Spigen, but I am not sure it will protect well from shocks since its so hard on back - the plastic touches phone on back.
Spigen have that tiny shock absorbtion mat on back and then theres rubbery material and then plastic.
The UAG looks way better than Spigen BUT I am wondering if that back ""Kevlar"" part will gather dust quick or get torn apart quick by items such as keys (?) and wont look as good as Spigen after some time.

**bleep** is wrong with samsung???	Why is it that Samsung finds it appropriate to include a micro sd cars slot in the $450 or less mid and low end phone but not include one in their $1400+ flagship devices? I mean i know the answer and its obviously not because there is no need for one because otherwise they wouldnt be putting them in the cheap phones+ And its definatly not because there is no room inside the phone. I saw the teardown videos there os space... Well it must be because of greed then. A way to force people to buy expanded internal phone storagre at a super inflated price. Well how about just charging a couple humdred extra bucks for a version of the phone with a slot in it. That wouod be a win for us all. Samsung gets there extra profit and the customers paying top dollar for the most expensive "premium" phones can have what they want too. But im sure that will never happen. But whatever there are plenty of. Companies out there making phones so I guess it's time to probably take another 4 or 5 yeal)? 9pmr break from Samsung until they get that **bleep** together.On one last thing don't sell people phone with 11 GB of RAM and tell them that it has 12 Gb and then reaerve out another 2- 3 gb for no real reason so that the available unused ram thats not currently being hogged up by all the pre-installed uninstallable bloatware garbage appsis less than note what the9was using three + years ago!Samsung you suck.... 🖕	N

Recently I experienced terrible amounts of lag on the phone, so I restored it to factory settings. It now runs well, but now there's this issue. I've looked in display settings, I've changed font sizes, and nothing seems to work.Solved!Go to Solution.	N

Post pictures clicked from your S22 Ultra	Hi All,Just thinking of starting this thread to post pictures that you clicked from your S22 Ultra.To start with here is one of mine.I am excited to see the Power of Samsung S22 Ultra 🙂 	N
S22 ultra	Come to find there's no headphone Jack in the Samsung Galaxy S22 ultra I use this for a selfie stick not for taking selfies but for taking pictures when I don't want to drop my phone or I need it for distance. Annoyed!!	N
S PEN SECURITY CONCERN	For the 22 Ultra, my S Pen unlocks my phone whithout me needing to put a code in or use my finger print. I just slide up the screen and my phone unlocks. This is with the phone shut off, it completley passes all security that I've set up. Has anyone found a way to make it so that a code needed when unlocking the phone with the S Pen?	N
Real or Fake?	I wonder what's up with all the S22 line issues reports on here. Haven't had a single issue on my S22 Ultra with 4.1. It's been so good I traded in my Note20U. I bought mine unlocked directly from Sam, used cloud to transfer my files and settings, picked up where I left off with the Note20U. Business as usual. I wonder if it's a certain batch, 🤔 or carrier issues?	N
Special Offer for Pre-Order	Has anyone encountered the price switch when trading more than one cellphone.In the Samsung Shop app is offering an $850 instant credit towards the purchase of the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra.I enter the information for my Samsung Galaxy S20 and can get $150 instant credit. I then enter my second device, Samsung Galaxy S20 and my instant credit is $500. So, I am thinking $650.00 of instant credit towards the purchase for the S22 Ultra.I get to the end of my order and about to place my order and the instant credit is only $535.00. Because I entered a second trade-in cellphone Samsung reduced the instant credit for the A20 down to $35.00.Samsung Customer Service could not provide an answer for the price reduction, so I removed the second cell phone. Has anyone else ever experienced an issue like this before?	N
S22+ Unlocked dual sim	I want to get a Galaxy S22+ Unlocked from Samsung but need it to work with T-Mobile eSim plus a physical SIM from a European provider. I got contradictory info fro.

transferred music from iphone, but how to keep music in sync between s22 ultra and windows 10	Hello!I'm a new S22 user.On the mac I'd used the Music app on the iphone and the Itunes player for windows.Now that I switched to Android. I am using the Samsung music app, what music app should I use on Windows that could sync music between my phone and computer?I know Windows has a way to link a phone with the pc, is there something like this for music.Let me know if this makes sense.Thank you,Dwayne	N
I enjoy my Samsung S22	I'm so glad to have this Samsung S22 in pink gold. Love the pictures and vids I've taken, flawless. And I enjoy tiktok alot...

Can't use $200 credit.	Everything about bonus money promotions has just been a total mess. I originally did the reserve sign up for the $50 off. The even kicks off, phones are able to be pre-ordered. Text about $50 credit nowhere to be found. I thought maybe it will just auto deduct it from the purchase. I wasn't going to stick around and risk missing out on limited stock due to current silicone shortages.While going through the process of pre-ordering I saw the $150-250 offer. Despite it seeming to insinuate that I could redeem that credit right away, I was not able to do so. No big deal, I was going to buy my mom a Galaxy A8 tablet so I'll just use it for that.Text about $50 code show up like 2 days after I already ordered it. Cool.My mom severely disappointed in Apple tablets battery life keeps asking for updates on the status of the tablet purchase since I told her I was buying it since she was about to go out and buy something new on her own. The $200 code finally shows up in my email a whole 30-31 days after the day it arrived at my house.Try to purchase Galaxy A8 tablet and couldn't use $200 code on it. Apparently it's limited to what show up in the shop when you click the Redeem Now button through the email? Great. I'll just use it on some Galaxy Pro buds and a charger or something. since I had to purchase the A8 with cash at this point.Try to use code and it saysThe email address you entered is not eligible for this offer.No change was made to your order.Sweet, more hurdles.Contact support through the "Chat with an expert" and they tell me its a backend problem that's being worked on. Been trying every couple days and still having the same problem. The Galaxy Pro buds went from a sale price of $150 to $169 while waiting for this so now that $200 credit is even less valuable.Can't believe a company this big can't get it's act together.	N

S22 Ultra won't rotate to 180 degrees. Why doesn't Samsung support inversion?	I've noticed every new Sammy phone won't rotate the screen to 180 degrees ( inverted). Is it a play to get additional repair dollars from all those broken USB-C ports from folks standing their phones on the charging cable (port stress)?I frequently want to rest the phone (chin up) so the power cable can come out the top, and still use the phone while it stands on my desk, or my chest (while on the couch or bed) and not worry about damaging the usb port due to the weight of the phone sitting on the charging cable (I've started using 90 degree USB-C cables now just to reduce angular port stresses).There are paid apps that will force flip the display to inverted, but for the life of me I don't know why this feature isn't available and supported natively.And yes, auto rotate works fine for 0, 90, and 270 degrees. Apparently a setting of 180 degrees is too hard to do?Try it. Report back. Will your phone invert the display to show properly when it's upside down?B.	N

I've tried turning off the Group Conversation mode, but no change in behavior.It's only an annoyance. But one I'd like to get rid of. Any ideas?	N

$250 credit for buying the 22 ultra	When I bought the 22 ultra I was told I would be getting at $250 credit within 2 weeks via email. More than 2 weeks later no email no credit. I called Samsung customer service and now they say it's a month or more away, as they have changed the delivery time. So I ask you, why there would be a delay in giving you a credit?It's not like they have to manufacture something, they just send you an email credit. This really seems like a scam. There's absolutely no reason why they should be holding that back.	N

Stop using camera lens protector	I see some S22 Ultra users are using camera lens protector. It is the most silly thing to do.

Lag and slow performance?	Hey guys. I've just gotten my S22 ultra. Very excited. After a day of using it, I've noticed that the phone is slower in its performance than my s20 ultra. I just have the feeling that the apps open slower, that, for example, when i open up spotify, it needs up to two or three seconds, where my s20 opens it instantly. It's not the end of the world, but i wanted to ask you if you have the same experiences, and if you know some fixes. It's the Exynos version btw, but still. It should at least work with the everyday stuff imo.	N

Google location history is pinging my device every 2 minutes	"Overall the battery life on my base S22 SD has been [pretty good](https://imgur.com/VoBzIUr), though I do notice on some occasions idle drain seems a little high, especially at my workplace. I've always just chalked it up to being bad reception since I found my previous phones to have the same behavior here.
Today I was poking around and found that [Google location history was active almost constantly.](https://imgur.com/edVUk9e)
I've never really paid attention to it much so I don't know if this is normal or whether it affects battery life in any meaningful way, but calling up location services **every two minutes** seems rather excessive. The most obvious solution would be to simply turn off location history altogether (because why give Google any more data than they already harvest from us). I got curious though and found that tapping the card and unchecking ""use precise location"" under permissions [reduces the pings to around 10-15 minute intervals](https://imgur.com/a/cppEd6c) which seems more reasonable while still allowing the timeline feature to work. The intervals also become longer late night/early morning as the device most likely recognizes that this is the time I'm usually at home so it doesn't need to update as often during this period. I'm wondering if the excessive pings from earlier in the day were because Google was thinking I was always on the move even though I wasn't and constantly trying to update my location.
With how many people seem to have battery issues with this phone, I'm wondering if having location history on is a big factor and whether or not Google/Android has a fair share of the blame here. Hopefully this post will help someone out there."	N
Ditch or keep the S22	"Hi I just recently got my S22 and like everyone else I'm really disappointed with the battery life. I also noticed a weird thing happening with the Facebook App where it opens up a new window every time I use FB. So whenever I click on the 3 vertical lines to toggle btw the running apps, it shows me a million FB windows. Maybe that's what's draining the battery?
Anyway, TLDR: I'm still in my 30 day return window. Should I ditch the S22 and switch to Ultra? Anyone in the same boat?"	N

HDR brightness difference between Fold 3 and s22 Ultra	"They were side by side in store so i compared a few videos side by side on hdr in youtube, both landscape and maximum brightness. It seems that their calibration is very different. Z fold 3 had consistently brighter image even though it should be the other way around. When you pull down notification bar s22 ultra had noticably brighter whites but in video fold 3 was brighter.
It seems like if you wanted to watch hdr video, fold 3 is better in general, but in a dark environment s22U would look more vibrant with deeper colors.
Edit: Could be because they are on retail mode or not updated."	N

I did another battery test today. Not opening the facebook app made all the difference.	"Ok so this is a follow up post to my last battery test, which I described here:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS22/comments/u0j140/i\_did\_a\_battery\_test\_on\_my\_s22\_ultra\_should\_i\_be/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS22/comments/u0j140/i_did_a_battery_test_on_my_s22_ultra_should_i_be/)
In that post, I mentioned how fast the battery drained when using the facebook app. So this time I tested without opening facebook.
The device I'm testing is a Galaxy S22 Ultra (US version, Unlocked, Snapdragon). I tested with the same settings as before: Brightness at around 80%, WQHD+ resolution, and adaptive smoothness. But there are a few differences between this test and the previous test:
1) Facebook app was not opened at all. If I wanted to use Facebook, I simply used Facebook Lite
2) Slightly heavier use compared to before (more streaming and about 30m of gaming)
Here are the battery usage details at 50% battery life
&amp;#x200B;
[SOT 5h8m](https://preview.redd.it/a6c00f4wo0t81.jpg?width=360&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6bb0af035480e38c5ee55ec5ee4f2c4d9ac727b)
As you can see, the battery went down to 50% after about 5h of SOT (actual SOT might be longer because apparently this data updates whenever the heck it wants). This is with 53 minutes of youtube and 39 minutes of disney+.
And here's the screenshot after the battery went down to 5%
&amp;#x200B;
[SOT 9h17m](https://preview.redd.it/6y5c9hxhp0t81.jpg?width=360&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d99365d9c2302e9bcc3838828fd88ef89f2b92b6)
As you can see, I got over 9 hours of SOT. I spent a over 2 hours on youtube and over 1 hour on disney+. Also not shown in the screenshot is the 29 minutes of Mobile Legends, which cost about 9% of my battery life (although on this Battery Usage page, it says 5.3% instead of 9%; No idea why that is, but if you have an idea of why the page shows less battery usage for Mobile Legends, please let me know).
One of my concerns is how quickly whatsapp drained battery (not as bad as facebook though). But then again, I was on video call most of the time.
So yeah. Moral of the story: avoid the facebook app. It might help with your battery."	N

Why do I feel like this is not a worthy upgrade for $2000cad?	N
Question for anyone who has used both the S22 Ultra and S22+	I love my Ultra (256gb, Snapdragon), but it's such a bulky phone and it's not very comfortable to use. I'm thinking of possibly swapping it out for an S22+ since the size and heft are a little more manageable, plus I wouldn't be sacrificing much in terms of display size or battery life. I'm not concerned about the lower resolution or lack of 10x optical zoom. Has anyone used both of them relatively extensively? I'm concerned about potential performance differences given the lower RAM on the Plus model and am hoping someone can give their input on how they stack up to each other in day-to-day usage.	N
Debating between S22/S22+, what are your thoughts?	I love the small form factor, but I understand battery life is better on the S22+ (although it has a bigger screen). Do you think the battery life difference, is worth the size difference? What have you chosen?	N
s22 ultra's camera performance (main &amp; front facing)	"i think at this point i know i am not the only one concerned about the disappointing camera performances. i mean it truly is a massive improvement from my previous s10+ camera performances, especially in low lighting but the specs that has been provided for this phone should've had much better performances than what majority of us are experiencing right now.
&amp;#x200B;
so y'all know how there is a ""3:4 108mp"" mode right beside the default ""3:4"" mode for the main camera, same with front facing camera called ""3:4 40mp"" and default ""3:4"". Now if im not wrong, the ones that has 108 and 40mp specified should be clicking much clearer pictures compared to the default but that is far from the truth. the default one doesnt take excellent pictures but definitely much clearer than the ""superior modes.""
on that note, i also wanted to ask y'all if y'all still got the option to turn on and off Auto HDR because that option for me is completely gone.
&amp;#x200B;
if i wanna conclude on this whole camera fiasco, it would be from samsung's software end where they need to fix shit up and over the next few months we should be seeing a more polished camera but i really wanna know what y'all have to say."	N

I can't decide which one to pick because of the screen size. My iPhone is 5.8inch and making the jump to the s22+ would be almost 1 inch. I have visited several samsung stores and I feel that the screen is too big and it will not be comfortable in my pocket. I would like to avoid the standard s22 simply because of its battery which, according to the reviews I saw, it s very poor.
Is there anyone here who have made the jump from little screen to bigger?"	N
Has Samsung Acknowledged S21 and S22 Screen Failures?	"Bought my S21 Ultra last February, so I was 2 months out of warranty when my screen just randomly died yesterday. I didn't do anything out of the ordinary and I absolutely baby my phone/am not clumsy (i.e., no drops). Went to a uBreakiFix and got the screen replaced, which is where they told me the bad news that it's only a 1-year warranty and I'm 2 months over, so I'd have to shell out the $315 USD ($296 before tax).
Anything I can do to have Samsung consider reimbursement (1 year seems like a short warranty for such an expensive device) or at least put them on notice? Seems like the BSOD is common enough on S21 and S22's that they should acknowledge it... My S7 and S9 seem like such solid devices in retrospect!"	N

S22 Ultra is in!	Only spent a few hours with this new phone and it's quite nice. So far no issues. A little warm on the first charge but nothing I'd be super worried about. Finger print scanner is smooth and works well. Pen is nice and grippy. Phone has the new update. Everything switched over. So far I'm loving this phone. Gonna spend a week or so with it and see how it goes before I decide to keep it or send it packin! Wish me luck everyone.	N
FRAUD	I went for the option of a trade-in from my Samsung 21Ultra, to a Samsung 22Ultra. Upon receiving my new phone, I carefully wrapped up my old Samsung phone and sent it on its way. about a week later I received an email from Samsung that they received the box I sent it in and it was empty and they will be charging my account $700+. I cannot get a hold of anyone at Samsung to dispute this and am going to end up being FRAUDULENTLY charged by Samsung for this. After this, I would definitely recommend not EVER using Samsung for any trade-in or related purchases.	N

Z fold 3 to 22 ultra	So I bought an S22 ultra because I just had to have it. I'm coming from the Z fold 3 which I still have and I have to say the battery life on the ultra blows away my fold 3.

Taking my S22 Ultra to Europe... Need charging advice.	"First time traveling to Europe so I was hoping someone could please help me. 
I bought a travel adapter not a converter and it has the receptical for a regular charger and one for a USB connection 
Does the charging brick that we use here in the USA do the voltage conversion or does the phone do it. 
By this I mean can I leave the brick home and just use the USB cord directly to adapter? 
Thanks in advance"	N

Samsung Promo Credit not Valid?	"Hello,
I pre ordered the S22 Ultra in one of the Sky Blue colors which finally arrived two weeks ago. They then finally sent over the $250 promo code to use at samsung and I was told I am using an invalid email. 
Now sure, I changed emails associated to the account because I had used my personal samsung account linked to my business email (not a corporate account). Since I changed jobs and no longer have access to that email, I had to change the associate email. Samsung is saying they cannot change the email associated to the code even though I changed the email before the order shipped.
As far as I am concerned, I am not getting what i paid for. Has anyone else experienced this? Any recourse?"	N
Well, I guess the "" Suspend execution for cached apps" thingy works!		N
'Suspend execution for cached apps' actually lowered my battery life	"I saw a tip here not long ago, that also worked on previous Galaxy phones apparently, to enable Suspend execution for cached apps in the Developer settings.
This supposedly reduced idle drain. And it seemed to do so with me at first.
&amp;#x200B;
However, my SOT took a nosedive, I use Gsam batterymonitor which calculates averages and it went from 8 hours 20 minutes or something to 7 hours today.
I disabled it a few hours ago (or actually set it to 'default on phone' which it was before) and the average time that Gsam calculates is already going up and I got way more screen on time too.

I don't know what happened. Take it with a grain of salt, it's just 1 guy's experience."	N

The in-display fingerprint sensor of the S22 Ultra is not reliable for me	"I'm writing this because I want to know if I'm the only one having problems with the fingerprint sensor on the S22 Ultra Exynos version. 
My experience with the sensor is terrible, some times it just works flawless and instantly unlocks the phone, but other times, with a clean screen (no screen protector) and a freshly washed and dried hand and it won't unlock not even after 5 tries prompting me to wait or put the pattern. I'm frustrated because the scenario is as perfect as it gets and it still won't unlock. 
What drives me crazy is the fact that it seems to be totally random, I came from a OnePlus 6 *(I know, pretty old, but I loved that phone so much cause it was fast and the fingerprint reader was extremely reliable and if the fingerprint was not recognized the first time (which rarely happened) on the second attempt it surely unlocked)* and I just cannot believe why this fingerprint reader works so bad for me.
I'm curious what's your opinion on how this sensor works for you, especially for the model with an Exynos processor.
PS: I tried registering my fingerprints many times and also not registering them for a longer period of time in hope that it will learn."	N

So I just watched a YouTube video and want the Spotify widget and google bar but I don’t see it. Is he using a launcher if so do you know what one.		N
What am I missing?	"So this paragraph is going to be a bit of a preamble. To begin with, I have been an Android user for over a decade now. I've never bought a single Apple product or used one before. So you might say I haven't exactly had experience in iOS. However I'm very active in the tech community and keep up to date on every new developing feature from iOS and devices that are released by Apple. Please don't downvote if you disagree. Instead leave a comment telling me why I'm wrong but try to make it based on facts not opinions or if you're going to use an opinion please be kind to engage in proper conversations with people in the comments. 
To start off, I'm going to talk about the tech reviewer community for a bit. There is a lot of bias going on here on both sides of the aisle. However I see the bias leaning heavily toward the Apple side. Tech reviewers slam Android companies for doing the same thing that Apple has done such as slowing down their phones or making up funny names for their features. I get that there's a lot of hypocrisy coming from some Android phone makers such as the removal of the charging brick and the removal of the headphone jack. However you can see tech reviewers talking about how it's not right that the s22 ultra doesn't have 16 GB of RAM when it had it in this earlier model that's 21 Ultra. Meanwhile the iPhone has 6 gigabytes of RAM and nothing said about that. Tech reviewers also like to brag about how the iPhone has a fast chip well they don't speak about how geekbenches don't really mean much. There are also videos where they talk about the camera and talk about how the Android cameras are better in every single way possible yet say that the iPhone is just better overall without even giving detail. Usually goes like ""however I prefer the iPhone's camera."" There was a Mrwho'sTheBoss video comparing the iPhone 13 Pro Max and the s22 Ultras camera and Samsung won many more categories yet he still said it was a tie. Obviously tech reviewers are heavily biased or apple and it doesn't really matter what they say however they influence a lot of the mainstream culture and belief.
Also like to talk about how the Apple community is very toxic to Android users. They seem to be misinformed about how their phones are and brag about features that were stolen from us years ago such as facial recognition software, widgets and most recently picture in picture mode that I didn't even have until today and some don't still. There's also this big thing compared to the fact that people think Android phones are cheap and garbage when they're actually more expensive than a lot of iPhones and the whole blue and green bubbles thing is getting me really pissed.
So what's the hype? What's the big idea? And I get it there's an ecosystem but there's also an ecosystem on the other side of the road. I'm not saying they should switch over but I'm saying why be rude to the Android users and why not at least admit that your phone isn't as good. I just think there's a lot of hypocrisy and lies coming from the iOS side.
I might be wrong so please feel too enlighten me but again don't dowvote because you disagree."	N

Samsung S22 Calculator | Is it possible to change Thousands/Decimal separators?	"Another newbie question, as I'm new to Android/Samsung but here goes:

However, in my country, we use dots and commas the other way around vs the UK, so ""one thousand twenty-three one hundredths"" would be 1.000,23 (*not* 1,000.23).

Are the S22U problems and short battery life worth it, or is something else a better option?	I really wanted to get the S22U because the zoom lens is incredible and the new modem connects with weaker cell signals better, but there are so many negative posts about "this and that" that I am seriously thinking that I don't want all the aggravation from that model and might be better off with something different. The new processor seems to drain the battery too fast. What's the general consensus out there, everyone???	N

Best Buy	"So I canceled my order through Samsung (S22U 512GB in green) and went to Best Buy and got the S22U 512GB in black. Two reasons:
1. Samsung was still on back order and the best buy is right down the street... why wait?
2. Best Buy accepted 3 trade ins and Samsung.com only accepted two. Through Samsung I would still owe 200 some dollars after trading in Zflip 3 and Note 20 Ultra. Best Buy allowed me to trade in both those phones and my Z Fold 3. So I got the S22U for free with a $70best Buy gift card still leftover.

Download SMS on Secondary SIM or Wifi?	"On my old Pixel 3A, there is a setting labelled ""MMS Messages - Send and Receive When Mobile Data is Off.""  When this setting is enabled, you can receive the data portion of an MMS message from your secondary data SIM when your primary SIM is set as the default for data.  Or, you can have data off entirely and the data portion of the MMS will come over wifi.
The situation with my S22 is that if there is an incoming MMS on the phone number associated with my secondary SIM, I have to switch the data connection on the phone to the secondary SIM in order for the MMS data portion to download.  This is a PITA.  
Is there any way around this, or are Samsung owners stuck switching data SIMs to retrieve an SMS from the secondary SIM?"	N

s20 to s22 Upgrade?	"Anyone go from s20 5g to s22? Hows your experience been?
Reading many reviews, I was disappointed by the battery of the s22 but then it occurred to me that my s20 only makes it 5 to 6 SOT because I'm running none of the features, and power saving mode (limited to 70% power)
I turned on 120hz, turned off power saving and my s20 heated up and drained insanely fast. 
Camera is definitely struggling to keep up.

How did you buy your phone?	"Did you use financing or did you pay the full amount? Or did you get a deal and paid for it that way? If you used finance who did you go with? 
I've always used financing. I'd trade in my previous phone and that would take £250 - £300 off the price then I'd finance the rest. I could trade in my phone for the S22+ tho cos cos I still had like £80 left to pay off from klarna and one of the terms were that they couldn't take in phones that were still on finance. I used Klarna for all my phones and this is the first time I'm using Samsung finance. I like that they have a payment schedule all the way up to the final payment and there's lots more info on it than Klarna."	N

Which model(s) of S22 have the flat screen glass?	"I hope this is the appropriate place to ask this question. I'm upgrading someone who has a very old device to an S22. If I'm correct, the standard S22 and the S22+ has the flat display glass, right? The 22 Ultra has the 3D glass that curves around the sides?
This person tends to drop their device a lot and I think a flat glass model with a temp. glass screen protector in a decent case would be better. Can anyone recommend a decent case for someone who drops their device a lot. I wish they still made the Galaxy Active line (that's what they are upgrading from) but they do not.

Should I upgrade from my Note 20 Ultra to an S22 Ultra or wait a year?	I usually upgrade yearly, but since the Note line doesn't exist anymore, I'm thinking I'm just gonna wait another year and see what new options I'll have then. The S22 Ultra doesn't seem like much of a significant upgrade from my Note and I'm still happy with my Note.

S22 Ultra using 3x optical camera for 10x images	"I was messing around with the cameras earlier trying to determine what each lens is used for, and I noticed that a 3x photo and 10x photo use the same camera. I'm assuming that would be the 3x zoom lens, which is the smaller lens below the flash. It's not until trying to take a picture at 15x does it switch to the larger 10x zoom camera (bottom larger lense)
Why would Samsung default to using a 3x camera with digital zoom over a dedicated optical zoom for images taken between 10x-15x?"	N

Google Phone app vs Stock Samsung phone app?	"as per this useful article, there are a number of Google apps that are less well known but are very useful:  https://www.computerworld.com/articl...s-android.html 
interestingly, they are saying that the Google Phone app is far more useful than most stock phone apps. 
i thought that i might ask the good folks here to see if anyone has experience with the Google Phone app and how it compares in real life use with the stock Samsung S22 Ultra phone app please? 
thank you.  look forward to hearing!"	N

Notification Drop down	"Hi, I have just switched from a P30 to the 22 Ultra and I really do love the device but the only thing I miss form the P30 is that on the bottom where the on screen buttons are there was a 4th button to allow for bringing down the drop down notifications without having to reach all the way to the top of the screen. Is there any setting or app I can use to have the same functionality or am I stuck having to get used to reaching for the top bar?

Battery life tips, work for me, what works for you?	"OK,  I'm sick of seeing the amount of complaining about bad battery life.  So , I'm going to explain what settings I have,  that I've always had on Samsung phones. 
1. First I set my phone to automatically restart itself every night at 3.00am. 
2. At least one a week , every Sunday,  I turn off my phone,  restart into recovery mode and clear cache, then restart.  (Takes about 2-3 mins altogether).
3. I don't game and so I have my screen on standard smoothness,  and lowest resolution.  ( if you have these to the higher setting your going to use more battery).
4.  I turn off location until I need it,  same as Bluetooth.  
5.  I also turn off find my mobile in the Google settings,  and in the Samsung settings.  ( this is just my choice)
6.  I also turn off alot of the motion and gestures in advanced features section.  ( I don't use them)
That's about it.  For me,  the biggest battery savers are , number 1 and 2. 
Simply clearing cache can help alot.  Especially after a update. 
This phone can comfortably get most people through a day, instead of complaining,  do a little research.  
Is an amazing device,  the best I've personally ever owned."	N

S22 Ultra - Pro Mode or Standard	"Friends,
When you shoot photos with your camera do you utilize PRO Mode or Standard.
* Pro Mode adjusting your own  ISO, Shutter Speed and Exposure
* Standard mode where you let the camera auto pilot capturing the shot
I am curious as to viewing the photos from this group, there are definitely photographers here that capture the photo beautifully. Do you notice a difference between PRO MODE vs. Standard when capturing the scene correctly?

Issue with Wifi calls	"Hello everyone. I'm having an issue that may not entirely be related to the phone but someone may have had it. I already tried googling it without success.
I'm usually at home and I always have the wifi call option enabled, but everytime I make a call (or receive) it works without any issues. But if I want to make or receive another call right after that one, it doesn't work. Incoming calls never show up and outgoing calls get stuck and I never get the dialing tone. I just leave it like that and maybe after a few minutes and/or hours it works again.
I've tested it by disabling wifi calling and it works without any issues and I can even make more successive calls.
Previously I had a S20+ 5G and also had this issue. It could be carrier related but also could be something with the phone settings, I don't know.
If someone maybe has experienced this issue and know how to fix it I would really appreciate it. The easy fix for me would be to disable the feature, but I want to use it if it's there."	N

Which one is better considering the Samsung ecosystem of watches and tablets and features between them?
Samsung phone vs Google phone?
I know Samsung keyboard has the advantage over gboard with spen,, but gboard kills in most other areas

Tips and Tricks for One Handing? Could cases and accessories help?	"So first few days with the phone has been great. Loving the camera, pen, and all the other new features. The size was an adjustment coming from a standard S8, but I've mostly been able to adjust pretty easily... except for one instance- one handing. I'd say I have Medium-Large hands for a guy, and one handing is just exactly *almost* doable. It's not all the time, but a few instances a day I'll have my hands full and need to pull out my phone and use one free hand to make a call, send a text, turn on a flashlight, or look something up. It's doable, but not smooth. I have an OB defender case, which I'm sure isn't exactly helping (yes, big, bulky, semi controversial- but the protection is necessary with my lifestyle because things get dropped and knocked out of pocket,  and I'd rather not test the warranty if I don't have to). Lately I've been contemplating getting something to stick on the back of the case that could help me get more of a one handed purchase on the phone,  or even exploring other case options. What have yall come up with to work around this? Do any attachable accessories stick and stay to the defender cases? I saw that OB has made popable cases for previous models, anyone heard if they'll be doing the same for the 22u and/or when? Are the any cases that have more features while still offering defender level protection?
(And, getting the obvious sarcastic points out of the way ahead of time- yes it's a big phone, arguably a small tablet, yes there are smaller options, yes it's made mostly for two handing... Great, got that out of the way)."	N

Why I'm returning my Graphite Galaxy S22 after waiting over a month for it (Smartphone Vlogger)	"Hey Reddit! I received my Galaxy S22 that I preordered in February and have been using it as my daily driver ever since March 28th (my sim card has been in it since the moment it was taken out of the box
In this post I want to explain what I loved about the device but of course what is making unfortunately making me return it back to Samsung.
(btw I made a video review as well link will be at the bottom)
&amp;#x200B;
I have been a Samsung user from the Galaxy S2 all the way up until the S10e (S2, S4, S6, S8, S10e) I always loved Android and Samsung appeared to give you the best options in terms of features (like 4K recording on the front camera for example where the Pixel 5 and I believe the Pixel 6 doesn't... only the pro devices)
I switched to the iPhone 11 Pro (then 12 Pro and 13 Pro) because I watched a few videos online of the iPhones Video recording and thought it would help the quality of my YouTube channel so much that it was worth giving up Android.
&amp;#x200B;
When I unboxed my Galaxy S22 I was instantly in love with the color. The Graphite S22 is one of if not the best looking pieces of tech I've ever owned. The look and feel of the device is unbelievable and it has everything I wanted the S21 to have (Frosted Glass Back, Matte Sides, Symmetrical Bezels)
I started vlogging with my S22 on day 3 (first few days were just normal usage and was busy with work didn't have time to vlog)
a few things I noticed pretty early on vlogging with my Galaxy S22 is that the Cameras have a lot of great options for vlogging like
• Ability to switch between front and rear cameras without having to stop recording
• Having 2 apps on screen (for example notes/script and the actual camera app to allow me to read and film at the same time)
• 8K is actually an improvement and it shows in the video test I did
• Double Tapping the Power Button to open the camera is something I missed dearly from my older samsung Devices
...but then came the issues...
• Battery dies out incredibly fast in comparison to my iPhone 13 Pro (or even my wifes iPhone 12 Mini)
• The first 8 to 14 frames I would estimate are full of stutter/lag and are basically unusable (which sucks because when vlogging I hit that record button a LOT)
• Front camera quality is pretty bad if there isn't any optimal lighting around
&amp;#x200B;
I tried using the phone normally and not as a vlogging device because I am buying a camera soon and wont need my smartphone camera to vlog. I've run into some more issues
• 4 Hours of Screen on Time if I am lucky
• Turning off 5G, putting apps into deep sleep and disabling things that a lot of people in r/GalaxyS22  mentioned did not help the battery life whatsoever (I am pretty sure turning 5G back on actually helped with battery life which is hilarious)
• The Matte Siderails of the phone aren't as fingerprint resistant as I thought they'd be... I am still wiping this phone just as much as my iPhone 13 Pro
• Social Media Apps still have Quality issues
• Visual Voicemail doesn't work on my plan even tho it works perfectly fine on my iPhone
• Important Apps still don't work that wasn't working on my Galaxy S21 I had last year
&amp;#x200B;
I really really REALLY want to keep this phone but it looks like everything is working against me. Not being able to match my Galaxy S10e battery life is pretty bad. I won't get the S22+ or Ultra because I hate big phones (the S22 is still kind of big if you ask me)
I'm giving this phone a few more days (until the return date Samsung gave me) but I don't see anything changing anytime soon. My phone is updated to the latest updates available and was not restored from a backup because I switched from iPhone. I even went to so far with this that when I put my phone on for the first time I created a new google account that had nothing in it so it was like really having having a brand new phone with nothing to back up or sync.
&amp;#x200B;
The fact that I won't be needing this phone to vlog with soon helps my odds of keeping it but if I can't have it last till 11pm its definitely going back. I am not gaming on it I only installed a few apps that I use (Instagram, YT Studio, Pandora Radio etc) and disabled everything I wasn't gonna use
&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking to purchase a new phone and think I've got it narrowed down to the Galaxy S22 or the iPhone 13 Pro. I had entertained the idea of buying a larger phone but I think 6'1 happens to be the sweet spot *^((laaaaadies)*^()). 
In terms of the looks department, I have to tip my hat to Samsung. The S21/S22 camera design is quite possibly the best interpretation we've seen of the camera bump problem. It looks far cleaner than Apple's giant stove top. The S22's new flat back and squared-off corners are ""iPhone-esque"", with the sides rounded off enough for comfort. Everyone seems to love the iPhone's retro flat-sides but they aren't comfortable to hold, and it's especially true on the stainless steel models. So yeah, point for Samsung for fit and feel.
Display is much of a muchness. Both of them are quality OLED panels with similar ppi, colour accuracy and high refresh rates. The iPhone has a better adaptive refresh rate (10–120 Hz LTPO) compared to the S22 (48–120 Hz LTPS) but that's hardly a dealbreaker.
Software wise, OneUI is arguably the best Android skin on offer. Samsung has come a long way from the days of TouchWiz. OneUI is feature-rich and has an insane level of customisation and tweaks, without any of the lag. Samsung DeX is awesome. It also has the addition of the Always-On Display feature (something iPhones refuse to have because... reasons???).
My main gripe with OneUI is that it's still a mishmash of Samsung &amp; Google apps &amp; UI elements. This is the nature of the beast, unless Samsung develops its own OS (again) or fully embraces stock Android. iOS, despite its limitations, feels more polished and consistent. Not to mention that if you invest into the Apple ecosystem everything works beautifully between devices (most of the time).
Battery is no contest. Unfortunately, I've read nothing good about the vanilla S22's battery life. It seems to be average *at best*, whereas the 13 Pro is far better optimized. 
Cameras? Honestly, I'm not a shutterbug so I'm not too fussed. Both of them have wide, ultrawide and telephoto lenses. I'm confident that neither of these current year flagships would disappoint this average schmo.
Basically, if you could put iOS (along with some OneUI features like DeX, AOD etc.) into the S22's body, you would have my perfect phone!"	N

Upgrade to S22 Ultra Snapdragon?	"I'm on the exynos 256gb and the Snapdragon variant has launched in my country this year. Since before the launch I've been muddling with the idea of upgrading due to this. I even pre booked the small s22 because it looks and feels so nice but decided to cancel as it felt like a downgrade from the 21 ultra.
I recently visited my local samsung store and found tha I can get the 22 ultra 256gb at exaclty half price after trading in my phone. I'm still not too sure if the upgrade will be worthwhile though.

Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra - Reliable Wireless Car Charger	"I was wondering what wireless charger will work fine with S22 Ultra in a car.

I have tested a lot of different USB-C PD cables, a lot of car chargers and the only one that really works good is Samsung original EP-L5300XB, BUT it charges good only over usb-c cable and if I connect it to Xiaomi Wireless 20W pad it doesn't switch to fast charge and battery is slowly discharging.

April Software update (Verizon)	"After receiving the April update on my s22 ultra I noticed much smoother animations and that 'choppiness' when scrolling is gone. I didnt know what to expect from this update as nothing specific was listed but the buttery smooth scrolling from the 120hz display panel was the first thing I did notice. It seems like Samsung slowed the scrolling speed rate down which now gives the display a chance to switch between refresh rates. Fb and Twitter was the worst when scrolling for me before this update came through. It feels like a $1300 phone should. Also, the battery performance has become better. I've only dropped 8% in the 45 minutes of use where before I know I would have lost 12-15% using fb, Twitter, Google messages, and tiktok. 
I have not gone a full day with battery yet but I hope to update with good results. I have screenshots from before and will post screenshots after of the batter performance.

To previous Pixel users, how do you feel about the camera?	"I've been a Pixel user for years now and currently have a Pixel 6 Pro, but I'm not satisfied with some things and considering a move to the Ultra. The camera is my main reason to change phones. Nevertheless, my research about the S22 image quality is that while a very versatile system with all the lenses, it's a noticeable downgrade in terms of clarity and dynamic range, especially the main lens. I'm a pixel-peeper and I notice these things.
I would like to hear about your experience with both cameras. Will I really miss my Pixel?

Samsung Trade-in Process	Hey all. I'm curious about how fast the Samsung trade-in process is from start to finish, start being when you send it out and finish being when you receive the results of the Trade-in.

Cool Customer Service Rep + Regular S22 Issues	"I've had the regular S22 since launch. I live here in Jeonbuk, S. Korea and I went to one of the Samsung Service centers because (1) the battery drains so fast that I thought it was defective and (2) the bluetooth audio quality (for both my Galaxy Buds and my car) is hollow and tinny--noticeably worse than my old A series.
The service center guy suggested removing the camera glass protector because that sometimes impacts the audio/bluetooth. Idk if that's true, it felt like he was saying ""Look buddy there's nothing else we can do."" It was like he was running down a dialogue tree of excuses.
He eventually came out to my car and I showed him how the Bluetooth is clearer with my old A series or my girlfriend's iPhone 12.
The guy at the service center was pretty chill, but he told me kind of 'off the record' that ""Ha, no it (the battery) can't last a day..."" They've been flooded with complaints about the S series this year but there's nothing they can do except tell people to download Good Guardians, turn off 5g, dark mode, etc.
He ran a diagnostics about the battery and told me that I shouldn't even bother with the ""Protect Battery"" feature. He suggested charging to 100% and then just getting a battery replacement after 11 months.
He filed a report with Samsung about the audio issues but there's no fix for the battery. Apparently battery life isn't even on Samsung's radar yet for the May Update."	N

Benchmark and review of 3 styles of USB to 3.5mm headphone adapters	"There are plenty of options for Android phones with Type-C connectors.
TL;DR: If i had to rank in terms of sound and cable quality, Black -&gt; Gray -&gt; Red (best to worst), but all were good, no regrets... they serve different purposes.
# Different Styles:
* USB type-c to 3.5mm male, 4ft cable, eg: B085RNB7CS ""red""
* USB type-c to 3.5mm female, eg: B09898M4X1 ""gray""
* USB type-c to USB type-c female PD charging + 3.5mm female (y splitter), eg: B0923X8MBF ""black""
# Devices under test:
* Google Pixel 2016 - Headphone jack and USB OTG
* Galaxy S22 UK - USB OTG
* Ryzen PC running Linux, Realtek ALC1220 Audio Codec, Line-In port
* Poweramp App, Deadmau5 Flac track, adjusted media volume to -6 notches from top
I tested adapters both qualitatively (listening) and quantitatively (with Audacity to generate frequency plots). I also compared Pixel headphone vs USB adapter.
# Results:
The ""red"" adapter was noticeably quieter than both the ""gray"" and ""black"" adapters, confirmed [by being -6db vs \~0db,](https://imgur.com/PHWAnmk) however quality sounded good with no pops, drop-outs or static. ""Black"" was also tested while charging and without charger connected, in both cases the results were the same, no static or hum was audible. It had slightly lower peaks than the Gray cable. Gray sounded fine, but the [waveform confirms it peaked closer to 0db](https://imgur.com/hybfDsR) (mitigate by turning down amp 1 notch...)
Microphone/controls were tested on both ""Gray"" and ""Black"" cables without issues on Galaxy S22, qualitatively, voice sounded good on call.
Noise floor of all 3 adapters was within error margin, meaning to say, no hum or static without audio playback, this can be seen quantitatively from the Audacity input level indicators (under -54db)
Pixel vs G22 showed no difference for USB adapters (expected)
Pixel 3.5mm headphone jack performed nearly the same as the Gray adapter, including the higher peaks. I couldn't tell the difference audibly though. Confirmed by listening to each track recorded to WAV, via Corsair Void USB headset on PC.
# Quality of Cable (qualitative):
\- Red has a great kink-free cable with strong reinforced connectors, however it fit slightly less firmly then the other two
\- Gray had tight fitting connector, compact, high quality flexible cable
\- Black had tight fitting connector, but cable/reinforcements felt slightly less quality.
# Compatibility Concerns:
\- Headphones have 2 or 3 rings of conductors. TRS or TRRS. I tested basic Sony earbuds with microphone/volume control. Sometimes you get swapped L/R/M pins with other headsets/earphones!
See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone\_connector\_(audio)#TRRS\_standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)#TRRS_standards)
\- Phones having direct analog passthrough instead of USB OTG, they require a different adapter, I did not test, eg: B07T23J7NV

- i wake up at the next morning, battery 65%
- i listen to online radio via browser during my 1 hour public transit time to work
- i seldom use my phone in working hours
- in those “seldom” scenarios i play simple games in samsung free, read news in samsung free / google discover
- i make phone call to my gf when i’m off from my work
- i listen to online radio via browser during my 1 hour public transit time to home
- battery usually remains 30% when i get home
- i seldom use my phone at home

S22 ultra screen protector problem?

Bose 700 Sound Quality with Android (SBC codec)	Does anyone have experience using the Bose 700NC headphones on an Android? I have the 700s and currently have an iphone, and the sound quality is great. I'm planning on switching to a Samsung Galaxy S22 soon and have seen that the 700s only support SBC and AAC and that Androids don't play very well with AAC all the time, so I will probably have to use SBC when my 700s are connected to the new Galaxy. Has anyone used the 700s with an Android with SBC? Is the sound quality noticeably different at all, or is the potential loss from AAC to SBC too minor to be able to tell?	N
Overheating, Advice Appreciated	"I've been using my Fold 3 for a few days. Yesterday I picked up my S22 Ultra when cleaning out my draw and it was slightly warm. It was off and fully charged. Meanwhile my S21 Ultra was cool to the touch and was off and fully charged. Last night I decided I switch over to using my S22 Ultra so I synced Samsung Health between my Fold 3 and S22 Ultra then turned my foldable phablet off. My S22 Ultra was fine last night, but this morning there was an issue. I was using my phone normally. I used the camera to take a few pics of a bird outside of my window, watched a few YT videos, and responded to messages on Discord. All my apps were updated from Google Play and Galaxy Store too btw. Anyway, I was listening to a podcast on Spotify when all of a sudden my S22 Ultra got hot. I mean really hot. I closed all apps and took it out of its case. Then I gave it a few minutes and it was still warm. I checked the battery in settings and then checked to see if there was an update. It was a security patch and I waited a bit to install it. The phone got really hot again installing the update and remained hot afterwards. I stopped using it altogether and now it seems okay. I have the S22 Ultra Snapdragon model. Should I be concerned? Should I contact Samsung about this and get it exchanged via factory warranty? I understand it getting warm for an update, but for a security patch and it being warm while it was off? That worried me. 
Some other info, I charge my phone overnight, but use Bixby routines to use standard charging. So I have fast and super fast wired and wireless charging disabled. My S22 Ultra and my S21 Ultra and Fold 3 are always cool in the morning when doing this.
I pre-ordered my S22 Ultra on 2/14/22 and got it on 2/23/22 if memory serves correctly. This hasn't been an issue before.
Edit: Requested warranty review just in case. Spoke to Samsung support, dude was impatient and rude. Plan going forward see if the issue persists in the coming days. If it goes away then great, but if not oh boy..."	N
Screen broken after 1 week (S22 ultra)	"Just got our phones about a week ago... one of them was dropped yesterday from pocket height and ended up with a screen crack in the bottom corner. 
Had an otterbox case but no screen protector.  The sales rep at our cell phone store insisted we didn't need them because the screens were so strong lol... I've never had a screen crack so quickly after purchase, it's still usable but it's frustrating. 
Currently researching screen protectors,  I've used Zagg in the past, has anyone tried them out yet on the S22 ultra? Or any other recommendations?"	N
Convince me to get the S22+ over a Pixel	"Going on a long road trip across the US and will need a phone with good battery life and a good camera for nature photography. Been looking at specs and camera comparisons for both of these phones and I can't decide which to buy...price is pretty similar for me with a trade in of my s9+ so that's not a concern..
I want a flat display so the p6 pro is out of the question...and even if I wanted a curved display, it seems like both pixels suffer from the first generation syndrome of having a lot of hardware quirks and bugs. Read that both Pixels bad fingerprint reader and no face unlock, sub par battery and pretty buggy OS/hardware.
Read that the S22+ has better battery (than the p6 and base s22) better display, but more saturated camera shots. I would like the camera to be as unbiased as possible in terms of color accuracy and focus. Although, in some comparisons the p6 seems to have more colorful saturated shots as well, hard to tell.
I would like to have the option of the magic erase and blur removal stuff from Google but I won't be taking moving shots of much other than the occasional quick shot of something on the road. I will be in a lot of national parks so the magic eraser would be cool to remove people from my shots. Nighttime shots look similar in the comparisons I've seen as well...maybe google takes the slight edge?
Still, I've read that the S22+ is basically a hardware upgrade in a lot of ways other than not having an ARM based cpu and will probably last longer and perform slightly better in terms of display, battery life, and will have security updates longer.
I'm not a fan of OneUI at all but I know I can make it less bloated with a few hours of work (AT&amp;T forced me to upgrade from a OnePlus 5 with oxygen OS because 5g)
Battery life isn't too big of a deal since I'll have a car charger for navigating and a power station at my campsites for overnight charging - however I will be going on full-day hikes and will need the phone to be taking pictures constantly with the screen on full blast to see what I'm capturing.
I don't mind turning off the cellular antenna and other things to conserve battery life.

My not so good experience with the S22 Ultra	"This is for anyone who is thinking of upgrading to the S22 Ultra. I recently upgraded to the S22 Ultra from my S10. Here are some things I like about this phone:
- Great big display
- Great spen navigation
- good camreas
- Actualy good Battery
- and good colour?
Keep In mind, that's the only good things I can say, these are some thing to jeep in mind when buying this phone:
- having 128GB of internal storage with only 8GB or ram,, while my S10 had the same and also had expandable storage. (The base model is the only one which has 8GB ram) I once used an S20 Ultra which performed much better, since it has 12GB as base)
- it keeps lagging. Which my s10 never lagged, camreas fail, spen sometimes doesn't connect. Annimations sometimes don't work or lag
- the S-pen is not bad, just I don't like that's the body is only black, no matter what colour.
- Dust on back camreas, just a pain to clean out.
- I can't 3D scan like on the Note 10+
- No charger brick
- and no heart rate sensor, not something g big, but it was nice to have when I needed it.
Keep this in mind when buying, and also these are just my preferences and my options. Everyone has their own taste."	N

Camera: needs a Sport mode with a (user definable) shutter speed limit at the lower end.	At least I need that, but if more would request such a feature..Problem is, moving subjects and low shutter speed don't produce good photos.And typically during action there is no time for manual settings.So a mode where the camera never exceeds a low shutter speed limit (ideally set by the user) and raises Iso to keep above the limit,but uses faster speeds of course if there is enough light, would make it perfect. Of course that should work across all cameras and shoot raw.So let's all tell Samsung that this is a needed feature in smartphone photography and make it the best brand available. As this would be an industry leading new feature. Regular cameras do it, but I know of no smartphone software that does.Please note why this is not Manual or Pro Mode:While 1/250th with ISO 800 works well in the shadows, it just overexposes once the ISO reaches its lower limit at ISO 25 in the sun and the shutterspeed still being fixed at 1/250th, or when switching between different camera modules, while 1/250th is fine on the dark tele lens it overexposes on the main with the F1.8 opening. Its better than nothing, but far from a quick point to shoot mode.	N

Did anyone of you faced a weird look from your friends or family for choosing the S22 Ultra over the iPhone 13 Pro Max?	"So I live in a society where having an Apple product is dominant. 
Last night, I was the only guy in the room with an Android  ( S22 Ultra ) and everyone else had an iPhone 12 or 13.
When I was clicking some pictures during an event, my friend asked me which phone I was using. I told her that it's the S22 Ultra. Then she asked me that why did I switch from my iPhone X to this phone and asked me the price of this phone. 
After getting to know that this android phone is as expensive as the iPhone 13, she gave me a weird look and I could definitely tell that I got judged severely for using the S22 Ultra. 
Did any similar incident happened with you too? Does the society really care that much that it'll draw a line and assume rich people people use iPhone and middle class use Android?"	N

Question's about sending my phone in for repairs	"So I'm finally going to be sending my phone to get the screen replaced (broke it about 2 weeks ago).  Generally if my phone broke in the past I would just fix it myself, but there seems to be only 1 supplier of screen/digitizer assemblies and it's overseas.
I have already reset it to factory defaults and deleted any data I had on it, but I do have a few simple questions for anyone that's ever sent a phone in for repair. I'm wondering however, am I required to send in a charging cable? Common sense tells me that a phone repair facility should have one handy, but the wording Samsung uses leaves it open for interpretation. I also assume that I do NOT send it in the box it came in? 
That aside, has anyone else sent their s22/s22+/S22U in for repair in the US, and how long was the process? I've been using my old phone since I broke the s22, so not having it doesn't bother me but my recent experience with shipping high value items in the mail does.

Sticker colors in the Gallery's built in editing feature?	On the S22, when you're editing photos with stickers, you can hit the smiling face and put Samsung provided stock hearts, squares, etc. on your photo.

My concern is that the uag monarch might be too bulky and heavy. I'm certain about how protective it is.

My phantom white S22 Ultra finally came in the mail.	"Coming from an S9+ it was a bit underwhelming at first. I had just purchased a S21FE for a family member and was so impressed with that device thst I had buyers remorse for spending much more for the ultra.  However, I have grown to like the ultra more after a day of use.  Being able to snap pics with the spen button is really convenient.  My selfie game has never been better.  Zoom? Wow.
Not sure how my battery life is (it's only been a day) but I don't have anxiety over battery cutting out mid day like my S9. 
The thing is, all of the features I dreaded missing don't matter too much anymore.  Not having a headphone jack doesnt bother me now that I have the Galaxy Buds Pro (I almost returned the phone and kept the ear buds, I like them that much). Music in the car? Bluetooth.  Music at home? Sonos.  Music at the gym? Galaxy buds with no wire getting in the way of my lifts.  I had been using the buds pro with my s9 while waiting for the ultra to arrive. I needed an SD card because my S9 was 64gb.  I had a 256gb card in my S9 i couldnt fill up.  No issue with the 512gb in the ultra.
Ultimately, I don't know if I would have paid full price for the phone but the $300 trade in for my s9, $100 in google play credit, and free galaxy buds pro.  Thanks for reading, this was a pricey purchase and i needed to justify it 😆"	N

S22U Ultra Brightness Issues and heating	"Hello all,
I'm using the Galaxy S22U Ultra Exynos Version since release now.
Since then I'm experiencing a lot of issues (like most people I guess) but it got a lot better over the past weeks.
One big issue still remains:
My phone is super dim. The brightness from my s22u ultra is way below the brightness of an iphone 13 pro for example. This issue is basically not present in rooms without sunlight but once I compare them it's horrific.
My s22ultra with 1750 peak nits has outside the same brightness as my OnePlus 7 pro 700 mit 3 year old phone.
I have every setting on max and as I said it is not an issue inside. But it's unreadable and unwatchable outside. Now the summer is hitting and everytime the sun shines on my phone my brightness turns under 50% and stays there until I restart my phone and leave it for a minute. This issue is always present and compared to an iphone even at night the brightness isn't even close.
Another issue is HDR. I can see that the menus etc are in HDR but the actually video...dim. just dim.
I'm reading a lot threads with the same issue on the internet but never any follow ups. I have the feeling that once the phone is compared to an iphone for everyone most people would realize the brightness issues as well 
How are your phones? Is it really a hardware problem and I need a replacement? The phones I'm testing in stores have the same HDR issues...all of them"	N

Do you regret getting the S22 (Exynos)?	"Hi,
I currently have a Pixel 5 and my girlfriend has a Pixel 3a. We are ready to get a new (flagship) phone and Samsung S22 is the only valid option at the moment (we both don't like big phones). We really like the ""Google Experience"", but Pixel 6 is too big/heavy and Pixel 6a/7 won't be much different according to the leaks.
But I read about battery, performance and camera problems especially with the Exynos version of the S22 (we are from Germany and there is no Snapdragon).

Since AMOLED panels are susceptible to burn in, why isn't manufacturers going back to LCD?	"Is the industry so stuck on the ""AMOLED"" hype train?
I had an s20Ultra which is burnt in, while I haven't unboxed my s22 ultra not knowing what to do (I do need the optical zoom).
Since burn in is irreversible, and the users may have to be stuck with a ""damaged"" device moving forward with almost no recourse except to potentially continue using it....
So what if there's deep inky blacks due to pixels turn off and so what if it's gives colours pop? There's known apps like Tiktok and even Samsung's own status/navigation bar burning in.
Also there are people who are PWM eye sensitive to AMOLED panels, they have a lack of options when it comes to having flagship features but without something that hurts their eye
A high quality LCD like what I'm using on my mi 10T pro would be virtually free from burn in, and would allow us to use our device longer, reducing e-waste!

(S22 Ultra Exynos 256GB) Pretty bad battery and lag in the UI. Is this normal? More info in the post	"Screenshots: [https://imgur.com/a/CY32yVn](https://imgur.com/a/CY32yVn)
I've been using this phone since the 18th of March. The 25th of March I wiped it and I didn't restore a backup.
I've seen better battery results in this subreddit and I'd like to ask you if I should get a replacement.
I'm on the April update.
I have ""adaptive battery"" off, ""put unused app to sleep"" on.
I use WQHD+ and 120 Hz. When the phone reaches 20% a Bixby routine turns the battery saver option on.
When I charge it while I sleep the battery is limited to 85% until 07:00 am when a Bixby routine will remove the battery limit.
I disabled ""battery optimization"" for some apps like Telegram, Steam, the security camera one and the One UI Home/Gestural bar ones to improve smootheness.
On a side note: the phone lags and stutters a lot of times and when I send a video on Telegram it frequently stutters (as if it was recorded at 15fps).
I'd like to get at least 6h SoT consistently. What should I do?

I'm losing my mind. s22+ vs s22 ultra?	"I know this is preference and, after doing a mind numbing amount of reading (for all brands), I initially decided to wait. BUT I was just offered $800 for my s9+ on trade in, after it was inspected. I'd be stupid to pass that up, even though I was planning to keep my s9+ regardless of an upgrade (a wonderful phone). I actually wanted the oneplus 10 pro but I'd get significantly less on trade in and it may or may not snap like a cracker. 
So I've been banging my head trying to decide. Holding the two side by side hasn't made it any easier. It'll be my daily driver for, ideally, at least 4 years. 
I'll break my thoughts down below (from most important to least) but, in a nutshell, the s22+ fits all of my needs just fine. It's a direct upgrade in every way. I have no experience with a note or phone like the s22 ultra so I can't say whether I'll like the features or end up not taking advantage of them. So, for me, the + is practical (I use practical very loosely) and the ultra is new and potentially fun. 
Can anyone tell me if there's a noticeable difference in battery life between the two? Battery tests I've found, online, swing both ways. The s22u's extra goodies may or may not negate the benefits (making it a wash). Yes, I've read plenty about the battery life issues. Seems to be due to some QC issues with the binning of the cpu. 
How are the two at gaming? The larger s22u suggests it may be able to dissipate heat better, but it's higher resolution may also cause it to throttle sooner. I prefer the fluidity of higher framerate/refresh over the clarity of higher resolution. 1440p and 1080p is splitting hairs at this size, so I'd prefer whichever can maintain a higher framerate before throttling (can't find any real answers to this searching).
I only take pictures when I'm sightseeing or going on road trips. The s9+ camera has been fine except for its abysmal night shots. Tbf, I don't take many night shots but that could very well change if I had the ability to do so. So I'll be perfectly content with the s22+ camera but I know I will absolutely utilize the s22u camera. 
The extra RAM seems to be situationally useful and not beneficial for my use, so there's that. If anyone has any experience that contests this then please share.
I do like that the s22+ went to a flat screen as opposed to the curve. I'm used to the edge screen design but I've literally never utilized it. 
The ultra is definitely big but I can't say if that's a negative or positive. I thought the s9+ was huge compared to my s4 and typically preferred smaller phones, but now I occasionally find myself wishing I had a larger screen for some stuff. So that goes both ways. 
Thank you to anyone who reads all of this and can help! This decision is driving me nuts."	N

Help with Google Photos and backing up images	"I recently got my S22, but coming from a Pixel 3a I'm very used to Google's services. I still want to use Google Photos as my primary gallery instead of Samsung's gallery app, but I noticed that everything I save is all grouped together in the gallery app, thus making everything grouped together in what's backed up to Google Photos (the camera roll)
Is there anything I can do for Photos to *only* back up the actual camera roll for the pictures and videos I take, or is that not a possibility because of how Samsung handles the gallery? I already made sure to uncheck every device folder inside of Photos so it wouldn't back those up"	N
Samsung smart switch on Windows	"Hi guys, I will be getting the S22 Ultra in a few days and plan to use smart switch to transfer stuff over to new phone.
My old phone’s screen is destroyed like I can‘t see anything on the screen but still can interact by guessing where say buttons are. So I will be planning on using smart switch on Windows to back up my files then transfer stuff over to the new phone. So far the only way to use my current phone is with Dex and Dex does not allow smart switch to be used.
My question is - this should work right?
And doing it through Windows like this should have the same result as using smart switch directly from both phones?"	N

Best Android App for "Write down this number"...	"We've all be in this situation a million times...  we are on the phone and someone says ""Write down this number"".
When I had an S-Pen phone, it offered that amazing feature where you can just write on your screen.  With a non-S-Pen phone, is there an app that somehow provides the means to finger draw a phone number/quick note with a minimal number of taps?
I love Samsung Notes, but there are a bunch of taps that have to occur to get you a place to scribble.  Same with Google Keep.  I can get there, but just not in 2 seconds, when I am caught off guard.
Can anyone suggest an app or some way to configure an app like Notes to shorten the time from ""write this down"" to actual ""writing""?
Thanks in advance!"	N

Stick with my S21 Ultra or move to S22?	"I currently have an S21 Ultra and I am eligible for an upgrade through Samsung. Via trade-in
I'm just wondering, is it worth the switch over from an S21 Ultra to either an S22 or S22 Plus. I'm kind of open to purchasing a smaller phone, and battery life isn't detrimental as I'm usually in my car or have a powerbank with me.
I also really like the flat body design of the S22, way more than the curved screen.
Plus the snapchat and Instagram integration is my biggest reason as I'm always using social media. Is the snapchat integration even that good?
Also what's the cameras like on the standard s22?"	N
Worth trading in for S22 Ultra due to minor "gluegate"?	"So as the title states, I bought a used Note 20 Ultra that was in great condition. I actually traded my old S10+ along with $100 for it, since the person wanted a smaller samsung phone. I was super stoked as it is a very nice device, however, a couple of months later I did notice the weird shade in the middle of the display and found that it followed the exact same pattern as other people experiencing gluegate. It's been about a couple of weeks since then, and through putting it under sunlight it seemed to start to go away. After a long road trip while using GPS, it came back a lot more. I don't use wireless charging either, I believe it just comes back any time I use my phone for more than a few hours.
I do see that samsung is still offering the trade in of $850 for the Note 20 Ultra when purchasing an S22 Ultra, as well as the $100 samsung credit, so just out of curiosity I wanted to see the exact cost it would be. After the trade in value as well as education discount (i'm a college student), it would cost me $420 for the S22 Ultra 256GB with 12 GB RAM along with a pair of Galaxy Buds 2 (which I was considering anyway as I lost one of my galaxy buds+ earbud).
So I could either ignore the issue on my phone and try to hold onto it for as long as possible hoping that the screen does not get any worse, I could buy a screen replacement (which would be dumb considering it would probably cost as much as the trade in deal, or I could go along with the trade in deal and grab the S22 Ultra. Any recommendations? I'm assuming Samsung would still take my phone, as there are no cracks in the glass (there is a minor ding on the bottom corner of the metal, but not too noticeable and I could probably color it with sharpie lol), and since currently the issue is really only noticeable at night or when I'm really trying to look for it. Any advice/experience would be appreciated."	N

Which One Is Better Galaxy Z Fold 3 / Galaxy S22 Ultra/ IPhone 13 Pro Max.	"Hello,
This is my first Reddit post. Apologies in advance is my post is too long. I am a tech enthusiast. I carry two phones with my all the time one ios(Primary) one android/ios(Secondary). Currently I am using an iPhone 12 Pro Max which I am very much satisfied with and a Samsung galaxy Z Fold 3 which I just bought last month. I don’t use the inner screen of the Fold 3 a lot I majorly use the cover display. I got the fold 3 because of its cool form factor. Since apple has introduced the new 13 Pro Max in alpine green I have had my eye on it. It’s a great colour. Also I love the all matte black feel of the Galaxy S22 ultra but at the same time I love the cool form factor of the fold 3. When making a decision I get very confused. Any suggestions on as to which road should I take ?
Also Camera and battery are not a major issue for me. 
Thanks."	N

S22 speakers are disappointing	"I've had a pixel 5 since launch and for a ""budget"" flagship, it's had the best speakers I've heard from a smartphone other than iPhones. 
I just got an S22 and for a phone which has better specs across the board (minus the battery), I was very underwhelmed by its incredibly tinny and almost radio-like sound. It honestly sounds worse than my OnePlus 6 from 2018.
Is this really the quality of these speakers? Or am I missing something? I've turned on dolby Atmos but that seemed to have no effect."	N

I need a new phone, I've been using a one plus 5 for the last 4-5 years, so I need something that lasts, the S22 plus caught my eye, but I've seen a lot of people say the battery isn't that good. For an average user like me, just sending emails and teams for work and mainly using it for chrome, YouTube and reddit, will the battery not last me even a day? Been racking my brain over this, i can afford the s22 ultra but don't feel like spending so much on a phone that's mainly used for videos and reddit. Would the s22 plus be a better choice?	N
Just got the S22 Ultra yesterday. Coming from Google Pixel phones.	"I feel like the Pixel peaked in 2 XL. I got the 3 xl. It was good. then the 4xl. The 4 xl disappointed me the most. The front cam got worst for some reason. Idk what happened. And I told myself to finally try Samsung. My Sister and Best Friend both swear by Samsung's Quality. They had the note 8 and my sister had the S9+ then they switched to IOS.
This is the first year my country went snapdragon instead of exynos. So far this is the best phone I have ever had and it has only been a day. Cameras are great. Specially at night. Performance is better. Battery is better. Video Call is better. Seriously better. Display is better.
I might get the galaxy buds next and the watch but idk. I dont really know what to do with a smart watch yet. 
Probably never going back to Google Pixel phones again. I'm pretty happy with this phone. Not to mention the foldables are improving every year. 
Anyway. Any apps I should try out? I think I read somewhere to try out Good Lock and ExpertRaw"	N
S22 series telephoto lens in 3rd party apps	"I am looking to get one of the s22 series phone. But I need the telephoto lens working in 3rd party camera apps, anyone knows which model and cpu variants (snapdragon or exynos) has telephoto lens working in 3rd party apps?

S22 Ultra Battery Life Discussion	"The battery life of my phone is very pleasant but there are certain things that I'm concerned about from 5000mAH phone which I'm not sure if I should've been.
1. If I'm using it straight for around 8 hours since fully charged, the battery is down to around 15% by the 8th hour. This might really be because of my straight 8 hour usage so I wouldn't mind if someone tells me that is the case.
2. The most concerned factor of all, when my phone hits the 5% mark, it doesn't take longer than 10 minutes to fully get drained and shut down whereas my previous S10+ could be standing still for 10 minutes while it had 1% left. Now is this the case with all of you or seems like just me? Because if it's just me then I'd probably wanna get a replacement sent by contacting Samsung.
Please share if y'all faced or didn't face any kind of problems regarding the battery of this phone. Thanks!"	N
s22 plus speaker sound	"Recently got my new s22 plus, not gonna review it, but the speaker sound is very sharp and very unpleasant to listen to.

Why s22+ and not s22: I have been reading that the s22 battery life is meh, hence I am choosing the s22+ because I heard that the battery life is far superior and battery life is a major concern for me.
So what do you guys think, is it worth an extra 250 to get the newer one or will the old one do fine in lasting 3ish years from now? Thank you for the help!"	N
S22 face recognition issues	The face unlock on my S22 stops working occasionally, in fact you cannot see the white light circling the camera lens which is an indication it is scanning.

Question about returns	I returned a defective s22 ultra. I figured that since I bought Samsung care+ I should have been able to get a replacement somewhat quickly. Turns out that's not a part of Samsung care+. But I'm glad I have it because I have dropped my phones in the past. The issue im having is that I sent the phone back outside of its box and without the USB c wire.I contacted Samsung order support and said "hey I messed up my return and didn't include anything but the phone itself. I want this return to still go through, so is that possible to do? I will pay for whatever materials did not arrive"The Samsung person just said "I have put a note on your order"I just really need this return to go through. I'm using this **bleep** s9 that dies in 2 hours almost no matter what. I need my replacement phone. Has anyone done this before? Do they accept the return and charge you anyways? Or should I be expecting to get my returned, defective phone back in the mail? The person on the phone did not instill me with confidence. She just wanted me off the phone. Making a note doesn't necessarily mean anything to me.So yeah, just curious what my expectations should be in this situation. Its already been **bleep** dealing with thus replacement process and being without a reliable phone. Just hoping this can proceed and that I can pay for whatever I didn't send back. They need to process my return before they can send me a replacement.	N
US phone doesnt work in EU/UK	Hi all,My daughter and I got brand new phones recently. An S22 and S22 Ultra. Then we went overseas and found an entire page of settings was missing so there was absolutely no way of using our phones without wifi. Thankfully the other half of our family uses iphones or we would have had a really hard time getting around! Anyhow, I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced this issue or has seen an update released to fix? I have to go back overseas in September and won't have the liberty to be phoneless that time. Can't believe a brand new phone could have such a huge flaw!UPDATE: Our carrier is Verizon. We spent quite bit of time on the phone with their help. The issue was not a matter of turning on service for roaming or anything like that. There was literally a section missing in the settings that would not allow us to connect. We were told it was a common problem with Samsung models S20 and newer so that is why I wanted to come here and ask if anyone had seen a fix or an update. Thanks!	N

I just bought a Galaxy S22 Ultra and am boarder line regretting it. I miss the ease of my Pixel.And WHY am I being asked AGAIN if I'm sure I want to edit or delete a photo?!?Every time I want to edit or delete a photo, after I've told Google Photos to commit the change, I'm asked AGAIN by the Samsung OS if I want to make the change or delete.This is annoying as **bleep** and needs a fix.

S22 Ultra Yellowish on photos	I have an S22 Ultra, and find that it takes great photos, except towards sunset, or in bright sunlight. Then all the photos have a very pronounced yellowish tint, which looks oversaturated and unrealistic. I can't figure how out to correct this, or whether the phone that i received is faulty. I have turned the scene optimiser off and on, doesnt make any difference to the yellowish tint.Actual colour of both buildings is more like the building on the leftI would like to know whether anyone else has the same problem?

Galaxy Store	Why do I need to check for updates in the Galaxy Store? I check Play Store, I check Samsung Wearable, and I check Galaxy Store, which has an ad and sometimes updates the same app Play updates. I use the Gallery and that's it... Updates should be automatic or not required. Especially things I don't use like Bixby. Have had Samsung since the S4 and the multiple stores always was annoying. I've only used the Galaxy Store when I wanted backgrounds. Put your **bleep** in the Play Store or something. Too much extra stuff on these phones taking away from things ppl actually want. You gonna charge a mortgage payment for a new device, I want a house, not a flyer full of ads and fluff.	N

Sports/High Motion shooting mode needed in Camera app	The camera is amazing at just about every scenario, except for times where the subject is in motion. Shots of kids, athletes, pets, people in concerts are practically impossible to capture without a significant amount of blur. And this is in direct sunlight. This issue causes the phone camera to be practically useless indoors and at night, unless the subject is stationary. Sure, there are partial solutions like using Expert Raw or Pro Mode and increasing the shutter speed, or using burst mode and selecting the best shot, but there are a lot of times where most users just want to pull out their phones and take a great picture on the first or second try without going into the settings. It also sucks because you would think with such powerful hardware inside, this would be possible. Other competitors are able to do this with inferior hardware. Samsung should be able to do the same.

Missing 1gb of ram...maybe.	As the title states a gig of memory is missing from my S22 Ultra. Under Device Care it shows 12gb, but under memory in Developer Options it show 11. BTW I have a Tab S7 with 6gb and it shows 6gb under both. Any ideas?	N
Can't download some apps	I am unable to use some apps transferred from my old S21 to my new S22 Ultra. Apps such as Insteon and Associated Bank. No updates for these apps are currently available. I have tried uninstalling Insteon and can't even reinstall it on my phone. I have tried downloading and installing other apps on WiFi and 5g but am unable to do so. Is it a setting on my S22 Ultra? Any help would be appreciated.	N
Samsung #1 Android updates	I remember why I went to apple after the long awaited updates to the new android but things have definitely changed. At least for those who keep the newest device. Samsung ranks number one for android upgrades. Congratulations, this is something the users can take pride in. Just to add, the s22 ultra is definitely the iPhone experience of android. Hope it only gets better.	N
Cannot redeem 100GB OneDrive Offer	Is there a one time limitation to this? I purchased a Galaxy Note 20 Ultra a couple years back and used the 100GB offer. I then purchased an S22 Ultra and my order says it includes 100GB OneDrive storage for 6 months. Since I purchased two phones, can I only use this promotion once even though the offer came with both phones upon purchase?	N
S22 bad idea to upgrade from note 20	The s22 sounds good but does not have a slot for a internal SD card, and it does not have enough internal storage to make up the difference. bad engineering progress. Make me a s22 with Removable storage and it will get 5 stars from me, without the storage its a zero for the money	N
Gallery Photos	I upgraded to the s22 ultra from a Galaxy Note 10 plus and now my gallery is empty. All of my photos are on OneDrive but I can't download them to my phone. Any ideas?	N
Samsung scammed me	S0 I received my phone finally, but Samsung never received my trade in devices, so I have been back and forth with Samsung and FedEx, showing receipt and numerous emails that I paid for the shipping box to send the trade in devices. FedEx shows me on video that I dropped them off March 15th ,So the devices didn't make it in time for trade in dead line, welllast Friday I received a package with my name and address... so apparently the FedEx employee was too stupid to understand that the label I printed out needs to go on outside of the box.. so I took a picture and sent it to the customer service department e-commerce that they sent me back my devices due to incorrect address,So now when I notified Samsung like I have been doing since the pre-order... well I was verbally assaulted and was called a criminal accusing me of trying to steal their products.... at this point my mind is totally blown and I was in aww.awe.. after so many emails dealing with Samsung, it became a emotional and mentally damaging situation.So now they took money and suspended my phone from being used!! Now I'm extremely upset that I'm being verbally attacked and punished for FedEx screw ups.. I have been on the phone too many times with out sourced people who barely understand English,,and they think they can talk to anyone foul ... I have over 40 emails since February 11 having problems with Samsung and asking them to fix or correct,now I'm out of $1200 and now I can't use my brand new phone, so I have to go buy another one... this is really messed up on how they treat customers and are allowed to.. I'm definitely not buying anymore products from Samsung..I completely lost faith in them as a company because of their business practices.	N

For those who write on calendar...	Ok so I like to put my bills due every month on my calendar and put a check mark on them when they are paid. (I secretly race myself to see how many days into the month before they're all paid, lol) So the checkmark wasn't lining up at all. I deleted the calendar widget and reinstalled it and deleted Google calendar to see if this would work. Nope, nada. So I went with a simple dot. It's closer to being there but still off. Not even sure many people write on their calendar. It's driving me a little crazy tho. I got issues, ya know. Things need to line up but not in a "I'm going to murder u" if the towels aren't straight. Thanks to anyone that may shed some light.	N

Samsung cash, Promotions, Pre-Order gotcha	"Maybe some of you already know but I found out just today that Samsung is playing a use-it or loose-it game with the Samsung cash, like the $250 promotion with pre orders. I didn't use it at checkout because I really wanted smart tags and none of the offers were for them. I also lucked out cause I put the 45w charger in my car at checkout once and didn't pull the trigger, then when I came back it wasn't there so I decided to wait, anyway I ended up waiting.  
When I got my email promo code for the $250 I went to buy the smart tags I wanted. 3 for $89, and I figured I'd spend the rest on something in the future. So I thought of something and kept trying and trying to find that remaining money. Surely there's something left, after all I only spent, $89 of $250. Imagine my surprise when customer service, and I quote, ""any remaining balance is forfeit"", what? This reminded me of the post not that long ago about, what happens if I want my trade in back. Turns out I'm that case you get a Samsung gift card for three trade in amount. I wonder if that's the same as this gift card offer? Use it or loose it. Hopefully not. 
So yeah, I was advised to reject the delivery, when they had their merchandise back I would get my credit back and from there I could make one inclusive purchase that used all of the rebate/gift card/store credit.  
So glad I called since the package is due today, by 20:00, as FedEx likes to say.  
I just couldn't get over the, use it or loose it, kinda doesn't feel like they did enough to warn people this was how it worked."	N
Powersave Mode?	So, this past Saturday I enabled powersaveode on my S22U as I was on an extended bike ride and thought it might be useful in extending the longevity for the day. Well, not only did it prove to be useful but I don't notice any degredation on performance 2 days later. The gain in battery life IS, however, quite tangible. I'm not seeing any reason to come out of powersave mode at this point. 120hz is certainly not a reason for me and neither is the alleged drop in CPU performance. The gain in battery life seems like a gift that I certainly appreciate. What other things are purportedly lost with the use of powersave mode?	N

Smartswitch from an iPhone to S22u?	"Just bought my wife a S22u. She's changing jobs and the company she's leaving supplies iPhones to the employees.

Question is, will a standard lightning to usb cable work to smartswitch?  I have this [Anker lightning to usb with a samsung smartswitch adapter](https://i.imgur.com/YvUhXk9.jpg).  Does anyone know if this will work, or do I need some special iPhone cable to transfer data?

ATTN : Here's How To Get April Update On Unlocked T-MOBILE	"Contact T-Mobile Customer Service. Tell them that you have an Unlocked BRING YOUR OWN DEVICE and ask them to manually update it.
I know this sounds ridiculous but if you have an Unlocked S22 Ultra and you still haven't received the April Update, T-Mobile will have to manually release the update for your specific device and it'll show up within 24 hours.
I got it done yesterday. I chatted with them around 4pm and got the update after midnight. Everything is working great.
P. S. If some idiot at T-Mobile tells you that you need to wait, or T-Mobile doesn't control the updates, just ignore it and talk to someone else.
Hope this helps."	N

I pressed firmly on the reader after the first UV cure, then then did four or five 60 second top and bottom passes with the UV. The fingerprint reader worked like a charm without even deleting or readding my prints. (I readded anyway, for good measure. Process was much smoother this time.)
YMMV, but it worked great for me."	N

Scratches? Screen and Body	I don't know if anyone else with this phone has noticed this but I upgraded from Note 9 to s22 ultra. It's been 2 weeks since I got the s22 ultra and I'm using it normal day to day usage until my case arrives next week. 2 weeks, and the amount of scratches on the screen is far more than what I have on my 5 year old note 9. Additionally I see the metal edge on the side paint has already chipped. Phone has not been dropped, only taken in and out of pockets and put on tables, most of the time camera side on the table. Is this normal? I am hella confused, wasnt the newer phones supports to be more resilient than the older ones? Or are phones not meant to be used without a case at all?	N

Keyboard swiping bug	Anyone else that's on April patch having problems with keyboard word swiping? It's driving me crazy. I've read about people having ghost touches but I don't seem to be having the ones they're describing. Basically I'll be swiping words and halfway through swiping a word, seems like it selects another letter causing it to have me constantly go back and reswipe. Does it on all the keyboards I've tried. Diagnosis on phone says my touchscreen is good. Last night I had a Samsung tech use my phone remotely to apparently fix it but they didn't do shit whatsoever to resolve my problem. Didn't notice this problem till April patch. Anyone else having similar problems? Already tried wiping phone which it still doing it after and made me mad that I wasted all that time for nothing. Considering downgrading April patch if nothing can fix it. Never dropped my phone or gotten it wet	N

5 days with the phone and I’m deciding to return it…	Inconsistent benchmarks, a laggy camera shutter, terrible video quality and a buggy ui that’s choc full of micro-stutters are just some of the reasons why my first adventure with the s22 ultra has been disappointing. At £1249 this is unacceptable. I’ve seen lots of talk of the Exynos being the issue here. I really don’t think that’s the case… I think the software is poorly optimised for the hardware. Maybe one day, I’ll try again… when we get a universal chipset across the globe but for the foreseeable future I’m staying away from Samsung	N

I know there is a know issue with RCS (advanced messaging) not working with others NOT also on an AT&amp;T S22. This is NOT my question.  I am just trying to resolve it not connecting to chat features at all. Been working with AT&amp;T social media team and they say RCS is not available on prepaid. I have verified my mother's phone (on my same prepaid account) can 100% connect to chat features and she's on a Samsung A51 5G (AT&amp;T branded). I know the difference with her device is that it's connected to the Google chat server via JIBE and not through AT&amp;T's backend as with the S22.

Samsung credit for phone	Bought the S22 Ultra directly from Samsung and received a $250 credit as part of the purchase . Tried using the credit the other day towards the purchase of a Samsung TV and it would not go thru . Thought i was going to get a great deal on a new tv with the credit . Contacted customer service for help and was told that the credit is only applicable towards phone accessories or watches. Really disappointed about this and it's another thing that drives the Samsung customer crazy . I do not need anything for my phone at this point , already have any accessories and the Galaxy watch i have i am very happy with and it works great. I am sure somewhere in all the fine print of the order i placed for the phone it states how the credit can be used but still disappointed in the restrictions of the credit. Doesn't make sense and i will probably end up letting the credit go to waste since it can only be used on things i don't need or want . Very frustrated.	N
Pre Order delay	I order my phone on Feb 15 and delivery date was 03.08.22, it was a gift for my wife birthday. Now it is delay to unknown date.

Thoughts on the new Samsung Galaxy S22	I dont know if it's just me but I thought since the Samsung Galaxy s22 Ultra is new, that it would be the best Galaxy yet. Obviously I was wrong. I think it needs a upgrade, not just a regular upgrade but gives us what we paid for.	N

Since I've never seen that on any of my previous Galaxy phones.. Maybe it's not huge deal to anybody else but for me it is since I'm very picky and like taking care of my devices and keep them looking as new as possible.	N

Worst Customer Service Ever!	I have been a long time fan of Samsung products, all my kitchen appliances, all my tv's, my husband and I have several Samsung smart watches and have only purchased Samsung phones for the past 6 years. We always pre order the new phones. I did a trade in with the flip 3 (horrible battery life) to a new s22 ultra.Samsung disabled my phone on April 5th due to owing the balance of the trade in. I paid it the same day. It is now April 19th. 17 phone calls, 15 emails and they still won't enable my phone. Every phone call has been, "I'm so sorry this happening to you, I have escalated this and your phone should be enabled in the next 24-48 hours" Every one that I have spoken with either through email or on the phone has lied to me. Beginning with the first one! I even reached out to other Samsung on Twitter and received a reply to send them the information and they would take care of it. Nothing, no reply, nothing. I have never been so frustrated in my life! Everything is on my phone!I'm going to call them again this morning, I don't expect a resolution of course, at this point it just seems like a game to them. As much as I don't want to, this has made me think that an iPhone is not that bad.	N

Any regrets upgrading to your S22 Ultra from your Note 10 plus device?	"  
How is everyone doing?! I have read through tons of posts on r/S22Ultra and r/Note10plus and recently purchased an S22 Ultra with the expectation of trading in my Note 10 plus. 
\*Did you switch from a N10+ to a S22U? If so, what has your experience been?
256GB is plenty of storage space for me. Ironically, I had 11GB of data on an SD card that I needed to move, and it was unbearably slow! So much so, I have retired the idea of micro-SD cards and will stick with my external SSD drives to move data. So, the external storage on the N10+ isn’t relevant. 
The rest of the specs are similar except for the camera, design, SOC, RAM type. 
I do have an S21 Ultra on one line, a Pixel 6 on another, and spare devices as well. Ideally, I’d LOVE to condense some of my lines into one device, but the eSIM experience seems lackluster on Samsung devices versus say a Pixel or iOS. So, I have this N10+ laying around, I didn’t want to hold onto it for another year and get less trade in value for the S23U – so I trade in my N10+ and after promo discounts, get the S22U for $558.
So, I’d have my S22U for business/professional contacts and my S21U for personal in a sense. I hardly use the line on my N10+ BUT that could change, and moreover, taking advantage of the promo value or wait it off…I know the user experience is the same. The price savings, and 4 major OS updates are partially why I decided to get it now, then it will last me at least two years, if not the full 4. Having an S21U, I wasn’t in a rush to get rid of my N10 devices, but if they won’t get any major OS updates – holding onto phones really isn’t ideal unless you buy for instance on a cycle, knowing you will retain the device for the next 3-4 years -versus being stuck on Android 12 for the next years with security updates here and there."

Hi, I encounter issues with networks today (at least, but maybe before too). Any idea ?	"Today, I notice my network is very poor in a city where I should have a way better network (typically, in the store I am right now, I normally have 4g/+, with at least 3 bars, and 5g, with 2 bars, I had this Friday, and today I have no 5g, 4g with 0 or 1 bar, weak H+). In the place I was this afternoon, there was a device preventing phones to connect to 4g/5g (I don't know the English term for ""brouilleur"" 😅) because there was an exam for other people there, but now and here it's not the case. The reason why I'm posting this here is that 2 minutes before, network was totally gone, no service. Now it seems to have a good H+ but not as quick as usual in H+. It's quite random I think.
My questions are :
- does someone of you already encountered this issue ?
- is there a way to fix that issue or do I have to wait foe an update ?
I did a cache cleaning yesterday (quite annoying though that we can't go to recovery without computer, it's the only way to wipe system cache...), the network at home was same before and after so I didn't see any difference, but maybe it's here since Saturday, Sunday or yesterday, or even today, who knows..."

It's kind of difficult to carry around a power bank, and if I can stretch it for another hour, that will solve my problem (i.e. 6hrs of SOT). I don't use any power-hungry apps or anything. Most used apps are Gmail, Google sheets, and docs. I have tried every other trick to stretch the SOT so far, and nothing seems to extend the SOT. I did use a smart switch to transfer the data from an old Android (OnePlus) phone.
So my question is, did anyone try resisting their device and did it help them extend the battery life?

Does anyone else think the S22 Ultra blows the Fold 3 out of the water? Has anyone switched from a Z Fold 3 to an S22U?	"I made the switch and honestly don't miss the fold one bit. Sure it was a really cool phone, but after a while I came to realize I wouldn't have cared for it one bit if it didn't have a ""cool factor"".
The Ultra can do pretty much everything the fold can and more.
-Much better cameras
-Better face recognition (because of better front facing camera)
-Better battery life
-Faster charging
-S PEN WITH PROPER SUPPORT!
-More durable and cheaper/easier to repair
-Thinner and lighter
-Better chipset
-Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor (so much better. Works every single time even when my hands are soaking wet. I sweat a lot too so that makes it even better plus it's in a reall convenient location. Makes unlocking while on the table easier as well)
Now let's look at what the fold has over the S22 Ultra.
-Bigger screen so multitasking is better
-Great for watching old videos shot with square aspect ratios
-Better typing
-Flex mode is nice for videos and taking pictures on flat surfaces as if the device were on a tripod
That's pretty much it. Even then you can multitask the same way with the S22 Ultra and it's still a big enough phone to do an excellent job of it the only thing missing is the flex mode, which can easily be solved with a kickstand. 
Typing is also still excellent on the Ultra and swipe typing actually works better due to the fact that the screen hits the sweet spot in terms of size. Not too small or too big like the fold and it's two screens.
Also when watching videos, the aspect ratio of the fold means that even in full screen the size of the video is not actually bigger than full screen on a slab (when cropped in). Yes you can crop in on the fold too, but you don't lose anywhere near as much of the video when cropping in on a slab and on the fold it's pretty much unusable.
Does anyone else feel the same way? I loved my Fold 3 but everytime I think about it purely based off of functionality I realize the only reason I loved it was how it looked in flex mode, that futuristic ""feel"". Practically speaking it doesn't touch the ultra."	N
S21U or S22U	"Hey,
Looking at either an S21U or S22U (maybe plus?).  I'm coming from a OnePlus 8 Pro, and OnePlus massively screwed the pooch on their Android 12 release. So since I may end up reverting and starting over I'm considering switching too. 
Last Samsung was an S9+, but I do have a Tab S7+ that's great. 
Honestly after this experience with OP almost ready to go to the dark side with Apple as I can't even reliably make phone calls at the moment. 
So....
On the Ultra side, I've looked at specs and all that and read reviews. I'm hoping to hear from folks that have/had both and especially how the phones are now that they've received updates etc. I know reviews of a phone when it's first released vs a year later with upgrades can be a big difference. 
I don't game, my main priorities are reliability, excellent camera, good battery life (get through day without needing to charge). 
I'm likely looking the eBay route and prices seem to be similar or at least not a dramatic difference. I'd be using it on TMO for whatever that's worth. 
Thanks!"	N
S22 Ultra - slim and grippy case recommendations?	"Just upgraded to the S22 Ultra from my Note 20 Ultra. I was using the Samsung Clear Protective Case in black. It was clear with a rubberized and textured black bumper around the entire phone. It was a fantastic case that was grippy and sleek. Also saved the phone from a couple drops. 
I'm trying to find something similar but have had no luck. The Spigen ultra hybrid is aesthetically similar but it's extremely slick and the sides offer no added grip, at least not the clear/ black version of it. 
What case are you using on your S22 Ultra?"	N
Coming to the S22U	"Just completed an order for a S22U 512 on Samsungs site. I was looking earlier today and left. Then received an email from Samsung to come back. Trade in on my Z fold 3 went from $900 to $1000. Not sure if they changed the promotion today but 379.99 with the $100 accessories credit I thought was a great deal. 
Also had a code for 5% off the phone price. Seems almost as good as the day of release deals. Looking for to trying out the S22U. Loved my old N20U."	N

Can't find "Block spam and scam calls" on S22 Ultra	All the sources I can find on how to block spam using an S22 Ultra say to just go to the phone app, press the three dots, go to Settings, then Block Numbers, then turn on "Block spam and scam calls".

S22 Ultra Earpiece	"Hi all, just received my new Green S22 Ultra, and I love everything about it! However, I was sitting in my car today and, while the phone was in the sun, something shiny in the earpiece slit caught my eye. It looks like a portion of unfinished metal right next to the antenna band, but inside the earpiece slit. I can't tell if it is a defect, or if it is supposed to be there. Do others have this on their units? It is really only visible with the slit under some bright light. I tried my best to get a picture of mine and a different one I saw on the internet.

how to claim the disney+ before phone arrives	"my s22 ultra has been delayed 14 days in a row.
uk disneyplus offer for 1 year must be claimed before end of tomorrow. - i will also end up losing £460 by end of tomorrow.. and knowning my luck also losing out on the samsung earbuds.
&amp;#x200B;
is there a way to get these sorted if my phone doesnt come tomorrow? (it was today but ...alas.. its delayed.......again)
&amp;#x200B;
samsung support were VERY UNHELPFUL saying ""we cannot guarantee the offer will work as it must be claimed by tomorrow, we are sorry for the unforeseen delay you have been submitted to but we unfortunately cannot do anything about this due to high demand""  
really? cause it was already delayed until 15th april after pre-ordering 21st feb.. and since 15th april i now have the IMEI number of my new phone and that.. but its been delayed every single day in a row since then. even though its ""prepared for dispatch"".. so they clearly have my phone ""ready""

S9 to S22	Question for anyone who has upgraded from an S9. What model did you upgrade to and what is the size like?

transfering question	"so I ordered my s22 ultra 21st feburary and last night samsung FINALLY text me to say my phone is being prepared for delviery (so hopefully will arrive later today 21st april 2022 after a long wait) -- going from s20+ 128gb with 1tb sdcard - to a s22 ultra 1tb)
TL'DR: can i use smart switch to restore my photos (to keep them in date order) without experiencing battery life issues? as people keep telling me not to use it, but ive used it since galaxy s4 (my first samsung smart phone) without ever having issues.
but then, as ive always used it, i wouldnt known any difference if it was ""effecting the battery"" like some people say. even if i use it just to restore just photo data (then i can do the rest manually) - or is the major android issue of date/time of ""creation"" for the pics been fixed or does it still do the stupid thing where it resets everything and messes up the dates?
\- cause with every phone ive had when i compare SOT.. i do seem to get ""less"" but that is also normal for exynos apparently. (my s20+ after 2 years gets 4 hours SOT, FHD, 60hz and about 9 hours standby time)
&amp;#x200B;
Full info:
ive always used smart switch cause i have 1000's of photos i want to keep and a couple work apps and 2 apps no longer found on google play or anywhere.
but i keep hearing people say they have battery issues after restoring? i cant say i noticed any issues on my s20+ for the past few years since i got it, but is this the case? because in the past i used to just transfer the pics from phone to pc then pc to phone.. but then i have 1000s of images all in a RANDOM order as it ""resets"" the dates to all be the same day/time so if i want to find a pic ... its very hard as the order has changed.  - yes i have folders/albums - but when i remember ""oh the pic im looking for is just after the ones with XYZ"" and then the order is so bad that a photo from 4 years ago can be able one i took yesterday for example - especially annoying when you dont look at albums but all your ""gallery"" in the ""pictures"" tab
&amp;#x200B;
(and before anyone asks why i have 1000s of pics.. why not? i like to keep my memories without having to mess about going on my computer so i can show people ... i point this out as people have had a go at me before about having 1000s of pictures.. i dont trust cloud storage and im not on my computer 24/7 to share a memory of a place that came up in conversation)"	N

A Factory Reset resolved my issues - S22 Ultra, Exynos	"If you look at my post history, you'll see that I got my S22 Ultra at launch, and I haven't been happy with it - it was laggy and the battery life was poor. I was reluctant to factory reset since I have so much data (\~400GB) and when I transfer so much on/off the phone then both Android File Transfer, and OpenMTP would crash.
I used adb pull / adb push to back up and restore all my data successfully and I performed a factory reset. I'm happy to report that performance is snappy, it doesn't lag, and my battery life has improved too!
For those of you who are having issues with your Exynos S22 Ultra then I'd recommend just factory resetting. 
P.S. Be careful with some of the battery optimisation tips/tricks you come across - some of them can seriously mess up your phone (eg clearing the Google Play Services data and cache - this really messed up my notifications.)"	N

Which one might be better - 13 mini or S22 Exynos?	"Hey everyone,
I have been using android devices for a long time. Currently I have Galaxy A50, which is already lacking software support (no android 12). I am getting 3,5-4h of SOT, which is almost enough for me. I need to switch, as it became very laggy and glitchy. Especially when it comes to the camera, it recordes only in 30fps. Never had a flagship before, never had an iPhone.
I'm really losing my mind when it comes to the new phone choice. I'm going either for S22 or ip 13 mini. I had both in my hands, each has their pros and cons, like samsung having 120hz and amazing build quality and 13 mini having clean looking app screen and smooth animations. I also want to try the IOS, just to get an idea how it is. 
The thing that is really anoying me in Samsungs is the poor optimization when it comes to social media - I can't stand the bugginess of camera on TikTok and Snapchat. I also don't really customize my phone other than changing wallpaper and organizing the apps. 
I'm asking for some advice, whether to pick S22, about which I heard many bad things, like poor battery and speakers, or iPhone 13 mini, any try out the IOS. However, I'm quite afraid of spending a lot of money on an iPhone that I won't even like. What are the prons and cons of each?

S22 Ultra (Discount) VS iPhone 13 Pro Max (Full price)	"Hey everyone, I could use some personal reviews.
I currently have an iPhone 6, so I figure it's about time for an upgrade. My mobile carrier has a deal right now for the S22Ultra (at $800 USD, with full price being $1200), and I'm debating it over the 13 pro max (at $1100 USD).
I've read reviews and seen videos, but I noticed that the iPhone is *slightly* better, and I'm here to ask if the price discrepancy is worth it, or if the S22Ultra will be enough.
The discount is for the base model with 128 gb and 8 gb ram.
I'm in college and tend to prioritize battery life and photo  / video quality, but I'm fine with carrying a portable charger in case the battery life is subpar.
I'm just worried of speed throttling after a year or two, preinstalled apps, software support, and other things that may lessen lifespan.
I don't tend to upgrade every year, so I really need it to last at least 3 years."	N

Just got my S22 ultra. What charger should I get?	"I was looking at buying Ankers 65W charger as opposed to Samsung's own 45W. Not because it's 68W, but because it's the same price as the samsing 45w, but has 2 ports. 
I have been using a note 8, which came with the Adaptive Fast Charging brick. I know this one is significantly slower than the 45W, but the 25W has very similar charging times as the 45W. 
My question is, should I stick to using Samsung's own charger or am I okay to use a different manufacturers charger, such as Anker, Otter box or ALogic? Is my phone's battery more susceptible to degradation by using these chargers?
Any other OEM suggestions also welcome. I'm in Australia, and the one from Anker that I was looking at isn't available here, but can be ordered via EBay. However, there is a similar one from ALogic that is available here.

Vital parameters on S22 Ultra	I am deeply disappointed to notice that that the cardiac and O2 sensors are not available on the new (and very expensive) S22 Ultra. I used to carry an old S8 and relied very often to those measurements.As a women, I cannot wear a watch 4 with a red carpet dress. So, having those measurements only available if and only if i wear the watch is very frustrating. Especially when you understand that it is only a question of software, not hardware. I have installed a concurrent software to do the job, but I miss the registration into a single place, my (previously) trusted Samsung HealthI had understood that issue before buying, I would have chosen another smartphone.What is the reason ?

My main current question is about the size (pixel dimensions) of the dngs vs the jpgs. they are not always the same. So can some one tell me whats up and why? Can you only get raw full size at certain settings/zooms etc. and is it the same in the pro mode wtih jpgs and raws as it is in the expert raw with dngs and jpgs. when I open in lightroom desktop pc they are nest to each other but some are different pixel dimensions. Is there some fact sheet that tells you what happens with raws and jpgs at different settings/lens/zooms? Thanks	N
GalaxyBuds2 Warning: Seemless Connection	I'm having a pretty terrible experience with my Galaxy Buds2 and looking for solutions. I will make a more in-depth post about that problem if this doesn't work but asking about one last alternative setting I might try.For the S22 Ultra under the advanced settings it gives the option to turn on "seemless earbuds connection". What exactly is the warning they give right on the setting itself in my screenshot exactly? It took the longest to read last night while looking up other solutions. Posts on this feature that aren't marketing thus actually useful, happen to be hidden deeply from me on google. I tried to understand this warning for a while before sleep yesterday.Is this because the Samsung coders have a bug like an unlikely race condition where another device accidently takes full control of my earbuds and bluetooth connection? Or is it an intention-driven security exploit that Samsung officially decided to not fix but is important enough to warn customers. In that security case does it mean the exploit is complicated and unlikely to be attempted unless I move to silicon valley or near a school for sketchy tech people?	N
Clock sound	The sound of the clock timer is so cool , it is like I actually using a metal clock, can you guys bring that sound and vibration to keyboard too?	N
Should we switch to Apple!?	Samsung is slowly but surely moving Apple way.-No AUX, No accessories, no SD card.In few years Samsung will be left with one thing to do call it's devices: Samsung iS30!You have to spend money to be different!Iyad Jabbour	N
S22 ultra digital well being	Hey all,Does anyone know why outlook is not removable from all modes inside the digital wellbeing. It is not all removable.	N
Samsung executives, tech, shareholders and owner of Samsung.	We the people at least most are not happy about the new smart phones and accessories that should but dont come with them and perfomance.We pay more money but we dont get sd card slot there is no ear buds, no screen protector, no charger the 22 ultra should start out at 12 and 256.You state glass and phone are tuff strongest glass made but a drop of 22 ultra and its cracked.Battery life not great on ultra and you added a GOS app to throttle are performance of are phone unacceptable. There are issues with phone that should of been delt with before launch.This a great phone but why have you done this to your customers who have made Samsung what it is today . We work hard for are money and in these times were in you should not be doing this .Please rethink this practice !	N
My Opinion on S22U, so far	"I've had the S22U/256 for 5 days now. It is, of course, beautiful. I have had no issues with it. The battery life is good. It's screen is beautiful. And I keep it at VIVID and bright... so beautiful. The sound is very good. No over-heating. Bluetooth connection was seamless. And super fast! You should have seen me crushing it on Wordle!  
I don't know if I'll ever stop missing my Aura Glow Note 10+ though. 😥"	N
This Phone Is Awesome!	"Need to say it - my S22+ is heads/shoulders above my beloved S10+.  I've had the S22+ for a couple of weeks now, and I find the performance and battery life to be excellent - in fact the battery life is getting even better over time.  Design and build quality is wonderful and I am happy to have a flat screen again.  Display brightness when viewing outside is on a different level altogether. 
My wife has the same experience on her S22, coming from an S8. 
Just wanted to weigh-in with our experiences for those that might be looking for user feedback for their own purchasing decisions."	N
S22 Ultra Charging Question	"Hi.  I know the S22 Ultra comes with a usb-c to usb-c cable.  I was wondering if it is safe to charge the ultra with a usb-c to usb-a cable and won't wreck the phone?  I am asking as I have a bunch of these cables and old adaptors that use usb-a I used for my previous phones.  And my power bars at home and my car charger outlet are usb-a. 
Thanks in advance."	N
When will Verizon ask for my trade in phone?	I would have thought a box or envelope would have shown up by now. Maybe even an email with shipping label, but I haven't seen anything.	N

S22U &gt; S21U purely for screen dimensions	Does anyone else purely rate the s22 over the s21 for its screen dimensions? The s21 is equal or even better than the s22 in some aspects. In speakers, it's better for sure. In battery, it's a smidge better, but negligible. The point is: the screen was not the right aspect ratio for me with the s21. The s22`s wider screen makes it worth it on its own. Its so much easier to type. You get more text content on websites. The s21 super narrow screen is means you have huge black bars on videos unless they're literally cinema-grade wide-screen. The s22 ultra's screen is so much better and that's the only reason I like it more. How about you?	N

Wireless Power Sharing	I've used this feature a handful of times and after about 10min or so it stops and says "there was an error with..." And stops wirelessly charging the device I'm trying to charge. This happens even when my phone has plenty of battery. Is there a time limit on this feature and/or have others experienced something like this?	N
Finally got my S22 Plus Just waiting on my Buds 2 to come I had the watch 4 classic since Launch		N
I feel so sad about my S10+	"This trusty piece of tech has served me for 3 years without fail.  My S10+ is still in mint condition (apart from battery) and I love the slim, curved, high quality metal and glass build. 
I feel like I'm betraying my S10+ by trading it in for the S22 Ultra. I know it's an all around upgrade, but that feeling is there like the Ultra is not truly the better phone. I have both phones now, and have to mail out my S10+ very soon. Any ideas for last things to do with this phone?
I used my S10+ vanilla for the entire time I had it. What can I do differently with the Ultra to customize it and make it a bit better to look at and use?"	N
is the latest April update really bad?	"My Ultra is going to force the latest April update tonight.. I've been delaying it because I've read problematic things. Ghost touches, lagging, poor reception being the main things I'm seeing. Anything I should be doing to mitigate this or just don't worry about it? It won't let me delay it anymore. 
This phone been perfect so far. 🥀

Remove screen animation scales for a snappier less laggy experience	"If you feel like your phone feels slow and want a snappier, quick feel when navigating your phone, turning off the animation scales in developer options is what you're looking for.
To do this - go to settings &gt; about phone &gt; software information &gt; tap build number 7 times and you will get access to developer options that will show up in settings directly under about phone.
Scroll down in developer options a bit past halfway and you will see three animation scales - windows, transition and animator. They should be set at 1x by default. Setting it to .5 will minimize the animations and turning them off will give your phone the snappiest experience. I have them all turned off.
I don't recommend changing any other settings in developer options unless you know exactly what it is and does.
Enjoy!"	N
Custom Straps?	Finally got my S22U after 6 years of using S7 Edge, and absolutely loving it but still getting used to the size. The official case with strap was an eye opener but disappointed with the lack of customization, does anyone know where you can get custom/unique straps for the case?	N
Has anyone actually got the 800 credit approved for AT&amp;T trade in promo?	Backstory, ATT store rep assures me that I can turn in my old S7 that does not power on and is horribly cracked for a full 800 credit. I think it sounds bogus so I look on the website and all the fine print seems to indicate it is true. I go a step further and call the Trade In queations phone number I was provided, had to wait through about 20 advertisements then get a message saying the number is not valid. Called back, selected a general questions prompt and was told by someone with a very thick accent that was constantly whispering to someone else that it must be in immaculate condition. I refer to tye website. He acts as if he has never heard of it and reads it with me then says ah yes, you get 800. I asked why he said perfect condition first then and he hung up on me. The whole vibe is fishy and I just do not trust this promo even more so now. ATT store rep also stated his battery lasts 3 to 4 days on his ultra with moderate to heavy usage... also not true. I'm just very skeptical and want to hear real feedback. So, has anyone been approved for 800 on a samsung device with a cracked screen that does not even power on?	N

100x Zoom Different than S21 Ultra?	"I was just comparing my S22U 100x zoom to a coworker's S21U as I was surprised with how much clearer the final picture is compared to what I remember my S21U was (I don't have it anymore). So I asked my coworker who also has a S21U to stand side by side and take a 100x zoom pic of the same object and compare
Doing this I noticed that the S21U's 100x zoom setting is noticeably zoomed in more than my S22U. Is this normal? I double checked both phones and they were both were set on 100x but mine is a bit more zoomed out in comparison which was weird to me"	N

Case with camera protection and kickstand sought	"Hi,
after reading that some people think, that [camera lens protectors](https://www.amazon.de/ESR-Samsung-S22-Ultra-Aluminiumrand-Schwarz/dp/B09LCY9JV8/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=s22+ultra+camera+protector&amp;qid=1650633664&amp;sprefix=s22+ultra+camera+%2Caps%2C74&amp;sr=8-3) can have impact on the photo quality (which makes sense to me), and after seeing [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/S22Ultra/comments/u8vzh0/small_mark_under_the_ultra_wide_camera_anyone/), which shows a microphone used for video recording, that I didn't even know that it exists, I am looking for a new case, since I don't want my case to restrict the functionality of my phone.  
I love my [current case,](https://www.amazon.de/Spigen-Kompatibel-Samsung-Galaxy-Schwarz/dp/B09JFKBY8C/ref=sr_1_14?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;crid=2COPTE635WNE5&amp;keywords=s22%2Bultra%2Bspigen%2Bcase&amp;qid=1650633868&amp;sprefix=s22%2Bultra%2Bspigen%2Bcase%2Caps%2C79&amp;sr=8-14&amp;th=1) but it doesn't protect the lens from scratches in e.g. a pocket, so I applied a lens protector in addition to my current case. The problem is, I can't find a good case, which does comply with all my needs. These are:
* A camera protecting slider integrated in the case
* A solid kickstand, ideally to make the phone stand in portrait and landscape
* A mostly flat backside, so that I can write with the s-pen on a desk without the phone wiggling around
I found two examples, which are unfortunately of too poor quality (at least it seems like if I trust the reviews):
[Croazhi case](https://www.amazon.de/Croazhi-Kameraschutz-Schutzfolie-Schutzh%C3%BClle-Displayschutz-black/dp/B09NDQH3DJ/ref=sr_1_12_sspa?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;crid=2RCZ85XZ6G9BY&amp;keywords=s22%2Bultra%2Bcamera%2Bcover&amp;qid=1650632631&amp;sprefix=s22%2Bultra%2Bcamera%2Bcover%2Caps%2C69&amp;sr=8-12-spons&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExQ1ZPRlEyVjhaOEFOJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMzc4NjYwWk5IV1dVN1Y2TklVJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAxMDA3MDEzRENDTzVPSEtXNjI5JndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfbXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ&amp;th=1)

Does anyone here have either one of these cases and can give an additional opinion about them, or maybe another case suggestion for me? I'd be willing to pay more to get a better quality, but these are the only cases I found, that even meet my needs. And for the Croazhi case I am not even sure, if it got a hole for the s-pen...

How long is the "learning period" for the battery? (sorry for another battery post)	"I'm adding to the pool of battery posts but I haven't really seen a clear answer for this yet.
Yesterday was my first full day with my 256gb snapdragon. I got about 4.5 hrs of screen on time. I downloaded two software updates and had Spotify playing a lot along with using multiple social media apps. It got me through the day no issue but I feel it could be better.

With lots of memorable travel on the near horizon I want the best phone camera I can get. I am 100% happy with my s21 ultra, but could be swayed to upgrade. 
Honestly the s-pen is actually a downside for me, because I would rather have rounded corners, but I would deal for a big bump in camera performance.

Trade in question-cracked screen	" 
So I have a Note 8 with a cracked screen, it recently went mostly black when my foster dog chomped on it \*sigh\*
I can still turn it on/off. The notification lights still blink. I can randomly get the camera to turn on and the screen is reactive to touch on the lower portion (it vibrates when touched).
Have any of you had a similar experience? If I send it in for the trade in and label it as a cracked screen phone, will I get the trade in credit? I'm worried they will say no because the black screen even though the phone still works.
I don't know what they do with the phones that get sent in but if they were refurbishing them to sell, they would need to replace the cracked screen anyway so I feel like it should get the trade in credit but I've never done this so I'm unsure about how Samsung handles it.

S-Pen to screen dead spots?	"Basically I'm finding spots on the screen where the S-Pen accuracy is very low, with the dot hovering a few mm away from where the pen is hovering above. The main point is by the magnetic enclosure of my phone case, but I noticed earlier as I was troubleshooting so to speak that around the right side at the top of the phone, it does the same thing (case taken off)
Basically, around the area where the magnets meet (it has a strap that has a magnet that encloses to the front flap, so when you flip that around the magnets meet) and then the little dot from the S-Pen will hover about 2-3mm to the right. Currently, if I take the phone out the case, the pen starts working fine again, however the point at the top right of the screen is still off.
I'm curious if anyone knows if this is related to my case or to a bad phone, I feel like the case could cause damage over time with the magnets but am not sure and I seem to experience it on other areas of the screen. I'm considering picking up another case, but if anyone has had experience with this I'd love your input."	N

I was shooting my little nephew's t-ball game the other night and I was maybe a foot away from the fence and it kept focusing on the fence instead of the players.

Is there a shooting mode that I can use that focuses on the game in the background and not the fence in the foreground?

Dark HDR and low brightness	"Sorry the video is in Korean.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPi9mjqX9zI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPi9mjqX9zI).
This reviewer compares the brightness of S22, S22+, S22 Ultra, and iPhone 13 Pro.  
iPhone 13 Pro and S22+ average at around 1000 outdoor while S22 and S22 Ultra measure much lower/darker.  This is concerning as Samsung advertises S22 Ultra as having brighter screen than S22, and on par with S22+.
Also, what's more concerning is that HDR contents on S22 look very dim.  See at 322s ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPi9mjqX9zI&amp;t=322s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPi9mjqX9zI&amp;t=322s)).

Does a clean reset actually fix battery life? (S22 Exynos)	"Edit: to clarify, in the usage example below, I was only using Maps for 20 minutes while I was looking for my friends and the rest of the night was taking photos every hour or so and the rest of the time my phone was in my pocket. Regular usage with me sitting at home or in my office with mobile data off still drains 10-15% per hour.
Been 3 weeks with the base S22 and I'm still only getting 10 hours of battery life with a full charge, and sometimes not even that when I'm actively using the phone. Eg went out last night, phone was at 90% at 18:00 and by 22:00 it was at 30%, which obviously isn't great since I was only taking a couple of pics and using WhatsApp, Maps etc.
I downloaded Smart Switch from the Play Store and transferred my stuff from my old phone, but I'm seeing some people say a clean install from scratch is what fixes the battery. Any truth to this or is it just a coincidence?
Although I have to say, even with the battery issues, the phone overall is still hundreds of times better than the Pixel 6 I switched from. I can carry a power bank to compensate for a weak battery but I couldn't do anything about a fingerprint scanner that had a 20% success rate (not even exaggerating, made the phone unusable)"	N

Is the S22U worth it for India?	I'm a bit frazzled because I had my heart set on an S22u. But the mixed reviews have me super confused. It's 1.2 lakhs so a mighty bit investement for me, do I go for it? For context, I'm a normie, not too into tech, but I have heavy and rough usage and will need it to last since I'll move countries with it too. Is the phone a let down?	N
Anyone in cities on Tesco Mobile actually get 5G?	"TLDR; Do you get 5G in cities? And do you also get disconnects randomly in calls still? Need to know if its a me issue or everyone having this. With O2 or any NVMOs that run under them.
I don't live in a city but accoring to the checker where I am there is supposed to be a few masts that advertise that they do been over in person and don't recive anything thought this + the call issues were the phone so got it replaced.
On my 2nd S22 Ultra now and this can't be another faulty device right? So got a new SIM card today and doing the swap in the next few days to see if the call disconnections cease. When I got the SIM today I said about the 5G issues and they (in store) told me that it's not around fully yet and it could be either in the next month or so untill ""the end of the summer"" say that some devices might see 5G but aparently at 4G speeds, but TM customer care say a whole bunch of crap.
One of these zones say that the signal is Patchy but its 90% a empty field. Clear sight fo the mast.
Then they waffled on about generalisations and averages and no I just want in in a few areas not the entire town. Then about the diffrence in components.
See irony is 5G is working with my families Iphones and I get diffrent components and such but they wound't but A12 compoents into a phone like this. Plus this does support NSA, SA and Sub6 same as they do and its not like it just won't pick it up the signal, I forced it to look for NR/5G signals only and still nothing.
I'm only doing this because I've already been down the ""I think the phone is broke"" route so trying the other for a change, but need to be quick about it because at the end of 5 days of today its either I return this phone again (that idk if i'm going to do because samsung is going to be on my ass about my old S10+ because it was a trade in) or the old S10+ like normal. Just worried that I'm being left with a broke phone."	N
dropped my phone	"DUDE I dropped it. First time. It was not soft. Wearing my buds pro in ambient mode and it fell FLAT on the screen at least 5 feet onto concrete. The buds pro in ambient mode bringing in all the sou ds around me, really emphasized the WHAPP sound (not WAP) No bounce or wobble, just a solid fall. 
I use the whitestone glass. It held up really good, a little cracked but not shattered. 
Anyone have experience removing the whitestone? My first time and I glued it so I don't know. I'm at work so I can't replace it yet."	N

Confused between S21 Ultra ans S22 ultra	"I am currently on iPhone 12. I want to upgrade my device and i am sick n tired of iOS. I am greatly confused between s21 Ultra and s22 Ultra. Price difference between the two is not the issue for me. I was inclined to get s22 Ultra but i know Speakers and Battery are better on s21 ultra also cameras are almost same (s22 ultra slightly better). I like the body of s21 ultra, more comfortable to hold. S-Pen doesnt matter to me as i hd Note 20 ultra and used S-pen for first two weeks only then forgot about it.
Please people help me make up my mind as you are the users of s21 Ultra. How has it been over the year? Updates and all, is it any better/improved now? How is your camera va s22 ultra? Are speakers and battery really better on s21 ultra?
Would greatly appreciate help here people, thanks"	N
I'm confused between the S21U and the S22U	I need a new phone, currently on the one plus 5. Where I am the price difference between the S21U and the S22U is only about 80-90$ and I can only get the exynos version however I really love the design of the s21 compared to the s22 and I'm really not that much of a fan of the curved display (hard to get a tempered glass and case) on the s22 and not that interested in the s pen, is the S21U worth the price here(around 80k Inr or 1050 usd and the S22 is around 1130-1140 USD.	N
I switched from Z Fold 3 to S22 Ultra.	"So yeah, i've done it. I switched from the Z Fold 3 to the S22 Ultra.
Here are my reasons:
\- Most of the time i didn't use the folding mode. I'm not a heavy phone user, i'm using it probably less than the average person. I used the unfolded state mostly for watching videos or streams before bed, but throughout the day i just barely had any reason to use it, so most of the time i used the front screen. Using the front screen wasn't enojyable for me since i dislike the ratio. So whilst the trade off (battery, thickness, weight) is fine for being able to unfold the phone, it basically was just bad for me since i only use the front screen.
\- Dust. Whenether i wanted to unfold the phone i had to swipe over the screen to get rid of all the dust. Since the phone is not closed entirely when folded, the inner screen will collect the dust. I wear the phone for a few minutes in my pockets and next time i open it i have to swipe over it to get rid of the dust.
\- Fragility. This is a big topic in the ´Fold Community. I see many people reporting about random screen cracks on this phone. I do agree that there are a lot of people without issues and on reddit we mostly see the persons who have issues with the phone, but those are still a lot of people. If the phone had broken pixels that happened during production i would say it's not a big deal, but the fact that no one can really tell under which circumstances the cracks happen is a big nono for me. Apparently Samsung did a lot of testing, but since those cracks were also present in the older fold generations and they still happen kinda scares me.
So yeah, those are my reasons. I don't want to shit talk the phone. It is still a great phone and many people probably use it corret, except me. It is a multi tasking monster and watching streams, videos and reading texts on the unfolded display is really enjoyable. It actually feels weird to have a ""normal"" phone again and not being able to unfold, but for me personally it's probably the right choice. 
So yeah, for now i'll pass the folding phones and wait how they're gonna evolve and what changes."	N

RCS still not working with S22!?	"I've been using Samsung Messages for about a month now without issue because that works with T-Mobile RCS.  I tried using Google Messages again and last night it was working, and now today messages sit as sent and can't see the other person as online (same problem I had before).  So I guess I'm back to Samsung.
How can this not be fixed after a few months and updates?  I'm even in Google Messages beta.
Or I need to flash the unlocked firmware so Google Messages uses Google servers and not T-Mobile backend I guess."	N
Hot take - S22 battery life is abhorrent, borderline unusable, for anyone who uses their phone for work	"I wanted to post this because I **WISH** the internet was more vocal about the device's total lack of stamina. The posts I read said it was just okay...okay for who?
Yesterday I was with two coworkers who had 3+ year-old iPhones and OnePlus devices, and we were in meetings and lightly using said devices. As we made our way back to the primary office, I checked in, and their devices had 10-15% more battery life than I did at that same moment. 
If I was attending another meeting away from a charger, I am not sure I would have made it through my commute.
A few things before the comments flood with suggestions:
1.  I have had it for over a month, so the adaptive learning is more than complete
2. Screen refresh rate is locked at 60hz *(my latest attempt to augment this)*
3. I have scrubbed my running apps multiple times to disable, deep sleep, etc. to ensure nothing is eating my battery
4. AOD is disabled
5. I auto-reboot the device every night while I am sleeping
6. Qualcomm chip
I joke with people that my favourite S22 accessory is the Anker slim power bank I now have to carry."	N
Any Fair Priced Phone Insurance for S22U?	For my S22U, I constantly see a monthly premium around $10 with a deductible of $150. Something happens wi 2 years, I'm out $400. My traditional plan is a strong case and screen protector + grip strength. If I could find one that was $6 a month with a $50 deductible, fine, but it doesnt seem I can. Thoughts/experiences?	N
thinking of moving from note 10 lite to base s22 snapdragon. would it be worth it? thanks.	the note is my first phone and it aged pretty quickly so, never buying an exynos again. but the battery life is quite good in it. wondering if the s22 sd would be worth it.	N
Just returned my S22 Plus for an S22 Ultra	I posted on here a couple days ago I was having regrets not getting the ultra over the Plus, after reading through comments I decided to take it back and exchange it, and wow the camera and screen are INCREDIBLE on this phone, keep in mind I'm originally coming from the iPhone 12 so the 120hz is all new to me, and the brighter display? I'm not really sure what it is but it's definitely better than iPhone. Anyway happy to join the android and Samsung family!	N

Verizon Theory	So recently I made a post saying that Samsung Calendar wasn't in my Galaxy Store well yesterday I asked my brother to check if he has the SC app and the Samsung One UI Home in the GS app cause he has T-Mobile and well it turns out he does have those apps in he's GS app.Now my theory is that Verizon doesn't allow certain apps to show in the GS, now it might be a Verizon/state thing where some states Verizon allows it and some states doesn't I only say this cause I live in Riverside, CA and SC and SOH isn't in my GS.Now my theory could be wrong but once I finish paying off my S22 Ultra and unlock the phone I'll know for sure.

Fyi Trade in promotion for S22U	Samsung promotion currently has $1000 value for trade in of the S21U towards the S22U plus you get a $100 accessory credit as well.I think this beats out the preorder deal since I think I only got $700 value for trade in plus $250 credit.Normally I prefer more trade in value over credits since I already have so many Galaxy buds chargers etc.Just a fyi in case anyone who has not traded in for the S22U yet.👍	N

If face isn't recognized and fingerprint is read. . .	Okay, so, I have a suggestion... If the face isn't recognized after the first few times and the fingerprint sensor is scanned, or the pin code is typed wrong too many times, it should take a quick hidden photo and somehow do something with it, I guess make it user choice, wether it be send it to secure folder or email or something.

Better AOD app?	"I really miss the beautiful Infinity AOD on my Galaxy S9, with the stars shining in the background. The new default AOD is pretty bland, the color options are even more washed out, and the custom AODs available through the Galaxy Store make the clock and date look even more boring. 
Anyone know of a good custom AOD app that won't kill your battery? I liked AOA: Always On Display for example, but it just drained my battery too much. Same with Always On AMOLED. I noticed there are a few more apps available like this but was wondering if there are any you've tried that you recommend, especially if you've found one that makes efficient use of the battery."	N

ESR lens protector ?	"Lately I've been thinking of getting those ESR lens protectors but here's the thing .. I don't like the idea of adding cheap(ish) glass over an actual glass lens coz of image quality problems (this coming from SLR experience) ... and also even if I do get those I've seen posts were people reported that it chipped away on the lense frame while taking it off .. and also getting the those lense protectors might mean I would be limited to phone cases that have either opening on the entire camera area ...  or cases with larger cut outs to fit the extra size of the ESR protectors.. 
I'm using the burgundy leather case from Samsung and loving the Petina getting darker.. but I've started noticing micro scratches over the lens. If I use the lense protectors it won't fit well on the smaller cameras and will create a small bump. Anyone have some advice ? I'd like to get the Kevlar monarch case and switch it around with the burgundy case but I don't like the idea of a bump on the camera area ... 🤔

Got S22 Ultra a few days ago and wow.	For the past 10 years i always had a Samsung phone since i figured iPhone was not doing it for me anymore but last october i decided to buy a oneplus 9 pro to try another type of android os. But many of my carrier features were not supported calls were always on 3g, no voice over wifi. So i decided to get the S22 Ultra from my carrier and I have to say it definitely feels like an upgrade compared to the Oneplus 9 pro. Display looks amazing, brightness is very good, lots of new customization compared to when i had my S10. Now im just trying to figure of I should keep using Google apps or start using Samsung apps(dialer, message,browser,keyboard)	N

Anyone used Dual SIM on a Pixel 6 compared to S22 Ultra?	"If so, I'd like to get some real-world feedback.
Hello ! Hope all is well!
After researching the differences between eSIM+Physical SIM (Dual) between iPhone, Google, and Samsung.  It seems iPhone and Google do it right and Samsung has some improvements to make. The two carriers in question are Xfinity Mobile &amp; T-Mobile.
That being said, has anyone used dual SIM on their Pixel 6? 
1. For Data, am I able to DISABLE 5G! ON both SIMS?! I don't want to use 5G! It causes too many service issues.
2. From what I've concluded Xfinity Mobile only works on Physical SIM. So I'd first remove my active physical SIM with T-Mobile; plop in Xfinity SIM, get it going on Sim 1, and convert my physical T-Mobile SIM to eSIM for SIM 2 and download it.
3. I then want to have T-Mobile serve as my primary for voice, data, and sms/mms. So I'd make T-Mobile my primary and the physical SIM secondary.  My understanding is the ""preference"" section is for OUTBOUND activities (when you initiate the call, sms/mms) but regardless BOTH #'s will recieve inbound sms/mms and calls will go to voicemail if active on a call on 1 line and the other line gets a call.
I presume Google visual voicemail works flawlessly for both,  and even Google screen my call on both lines?
Am I missing anything?! I'm trying to be as detailed as possible because if something doesn't work the way I need it, then I'll have to hold off on eSIM with these two carriers. 
I essentially want my T-Mobile to serve as my primary as it will recieve the most action and have Xfinity as a secondary, reactive throw away number.  It's a number I use because it lowered my internet bill,  otherwise I wouldn't have use for it. Trying to carry 1 less phone. So basically the off chance I text someone from the Xfinity number, with my default settings on T-Mobile, are we able to still initiate calls/sms mms from the second SIM by editing this before hitting send or call without changing default settings?
I hope I've made sense 😅 "	N

85% or 100%. which is better	"I know this topic is discussed already umpteen times and internet is split. But i would like to know if there is any advantage of charging only till 85% and not all the way to 100%. I regularly plug in at 20%. I am someone who can't carry a charger or powerbank to topup whenever need. I need the phone to power me for a day atleast. By using 85% to 20% i couldn't get one day battery life.  And i am not comfortable (at least for now). I don't fast charge too. Always slow charging which takes 1hrs 40 mins for 20 to 80 and 2hrs 10mins for 20 to 100. So timing is also a key here. I am planning to keep this device for another 4years. So pls tell me if its ok to topup to 100 or should i limit to 85.

I have an S20 Ultra 5G from Canada and the trade in offer for the S22 Ultra is really good ($299). I'm going to be in the US anyways and was thinking of getting the device there. I messaged the Samsung Chat and they said that's fine, but they also will likely say anything to sell a device.
Reading the Ts and Cs I don't see anything specifically prohibiting it, simply that the device must be authorized for use by the FCC which it is, since it's the same model that's sold in the US from what I understand.
Just wanting to see if anyone has any 1st hand experience doing this. Thanks!"	N

should I buy it?	"I decided to buy S22 ultra snapdragon version from Hong Kong, but it seems that 5g networks of this version(SM-s9080) don't work in Eu, therefore my only option is to order my device from local market with Exynos chipset.  My question is, maybe someone has an Exynos version? It works well? Battery, camera, gaming? Or has someone imported Hong Kong version to Eu?
Thanks alot if you guide me to decide about it."	N

Does the S22 Exynos really disappoint?		N
I tracked the battery usage of my Exynos S22 for 2 months. Here's what I found.	"# Context
I pre-ordered an unlocked 256G Exynos base S22 and received it on March 3. I upgraded from a Note9, and while I really love this phone, the battery life left a lot to be desired. So I started obsessively tracking my battery usage to look at the battery performance systematically and statistically. This post is actually my third (and hopefully last) post on this topic.
At one point, the battery was so bad that I reached out to Samsung support and got my phone exchanged for another unit, and even the Samsung CS rep thought that my phone's battery was terrible and got it exchanged for me right away. I had to send in my first unit to get my replacement unit, and sent in my first unit on March 25 and got my 2nd unit on April 10. So although there is a 2-week blank period of when I was waiting for my replacement unit, I tracked my battery usage almost daily starting from March 5 until today, April 24. 
This means that I went through 4 software versions throughout my experiment:
* Out-of-the-box software
* March GOS update, received on March 11
* First April update, released on April 1, received on April 10 (the day I got my 2nd unit)
* Second April update, received April 19
I also don't game at all on my phone, and as a digital privacy advocate, I use mainly open source apps from F-droid or stock Samsung apps, don't use any social media except for reddit, have location services disabled at all times except for when I use apps that require it, have the Google app disabled, and many of the Google-related functions disabled. I also uninstalled everything Facebook related and some other bloatware via adb.
# Approach
I wanted to look at my battery usage patterns by answering the 3 questions:
1. Is there any statistically significant difference between my first unit and my replacement unit?
2. How much battery is drained overnight by idle drain?
3. How much active SOT do I get on average? 
I switched up my phone's configurations every now and then, but my base configurations throughout my experiment were:
* Phone setup from scratch with no SmartSwitch
* Charge level capped to 85% from protect battery setting
* Adaptive battery: On
* Processing speed: Optimized
* Adaptive power saving: On
* Super fast charging: On (Using official 25W charger)
* Fast wireless charging: On (Using official Samsung duo wireless charger)
* Dark mode: On
* Adaptive brightness: On
* Motion smoothness: Adaptive
* Eye comfort shield: Sunset to sunrise
* Screen mode: Vivid
* Bluetooth: On
* NFC: Off
* Location: Off
* VoLTE: On
* Wi-Fi Calling: On
* Wi-Fi power saving mode: On
* Bluetooth: On (always connected to my Garmin watch)

* [Graph 4 - Active SOT per total uptime](https://imgur.com/tGx4udK)
# Findings
&gt; Is there any statistically significant difference between my first unit and my replacement unit?
* **There didn't seem to be a drastic difference between my first unit and my second unit**, although I can't be 100% sure since I wasn't able to run the experiment with identical settings on both units simultaneously. 
&gt; How much battery is drained overnight by idle drain? (Graph 1)
* **My overnight idle drain was an average of 1.9%/hr, with a max of 4.6%/hr and 0.4%/hr**. 
* I initially got terrible overnight idle drain with 4.6%/hr (33% drained after 7:09h), but this was due to a bug on the Exynos models where the device wouldn't go to deep sleep if the WiFi module was on. 
* Turning off WiFi reduced it to 1.4%/hr (see March 9), and then the March GOS update also helped reduce idle drain to 1.7%/hr with WiFi on (see March 12). 
* I tried putting my phone on airplane mode on March 17, and saw that the hourly drain was only 0.4%/hr, so I knew that it could be better.
* I got 1.3%/hr with 4G on April 10 on my second device with the first April update, which meant my second unit wasn't much better than my first unit.
* I experimented with putting my phone on battery saver mode overnight on both WiFi and 4G, and got 1.7%/hr and 1.3%/hr respectively, meaning **battery saver mode didn't really help idle drain.**
* I accidentally went to sleep with my Bluetooth headphones connected on April 14, which spiked up the hourly drain to 4.3%/hr. 
* The second April update on April 20 finally fixed the Exynos WiFi bug, and hourly drain has been reduced to 1.2%/hr and 0.9%/hr even on WiFi
* For some reason, the hourly drain last night on April 24 was 13%/hr, but my guess is that since the phone was at 14% when I went to bed, and as many here have stated, the last percentages drop down extremely fast. Therefore, the last 10% drained very quickly overnight, and it was at 1% when I woke up this morning.
&gt; How much active SOT do I get on average? 
* **My active SOT was an average of 2.6h, with a max of 4.4h and a min of 1.3h.** 
* Since I mostly charged up to 85%, I extrapolated my battery usage data points to a 100% and assuming linearity, and got a **predicted average SOT of 3:15h on my first unit and 3:38h on my second unit**. I suspect the 23 minute difference is due to software differences and not hardware differences, but this can't be proven.
* [Worst - battery usage screenshot for April 19, 1:16h active SOT](https://imgur.com/kBIGkDk) - On this day, something with Bixby was apparently acting up. Even though Bixby Voice was active for less than 1m, it took up the most of my battery at 5.6% from just sitting in the background. Not sure why this happened, but it hasn't happened since.
* Looking at some people who are getting 5 or even 8 hours of SOT on their Exynos S22s on this sub, I noticed a common pattern: *Most of the great active SOTs are from people who are constantly using their phones, where they have a high active SOT % per total uptime.* This gave me the hypothesis that ***my battery life issue is not that my phone's battery drains quickly while I'm using the phone, but rather that my phone drains too much in idle that the battery is drained even before I can use it in the first place.***
* [Best - battery usage screenshot for April 23, 4:23h active SOT](https://imgur.com/uwxGibv) To test the hypothesis, I actively tried to use my phone as much as I could on April 23, to keep the screen on more than off as much as I could. What do you know, **this was when I finally got more than 4 hours of SOT after 2 months of using the phone.**
* This hypothesis was further confirmed by plotting active SOT vs.% of active SOT per total uptime (graph 4), which shows a positive correlation with a R^2 value of 0.19 for my first unit and 0.35 for my second. Not the strongest evidence, but still enough to make you think.
# Conclusion
* I still don't think the battery life of the base S22 Exynos is great, but at least I know that the issue is more with idle drain than how much battery is drained when I'm actively using it. The second April update also was a huge improvement in the idle drain, so I'm cautiously optimistic that this can be improved from future updates. I'm still not very happy with the battery life, but now it's at a point where I can at least use it for 
* The most significant improvements of my battery life was 1) turning off 5G, 2) keeping my phone up-to-date
* For the time being, I've solved my battery anxiety by purchasing the [Samsung 25W Wireless Portable Battery](https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/mobile-accessories/phones/25w-wireless-portable-battery--silver-eb-u3300xjegus/) and always carrying it around with me. If you have battery anxiety, I suggest you do the same. 
* Looking on the bright side, battery issues can be mitigated by carrying around a battery pack, but OS-level bugs or other hardware issues (ex: bad camera) can't. So maybe it's not too bad. I also intentionally don't trickle-charge during the day to elongate my battery lifespan, but if you have access to a charger, maybe just charge during the day for your peace of mind and don't bother with obsessively tracking your battery for 2 months like me.
This was a very long post, but I hope it's informative and helpful for some.

I've tried backing up / restoring just 'Messages' a few times since and after the transfer completes, it keeps getting stuck on 'Organizing your transferred data'. It's consistently staying at 4 hours 22 minutes remaining every time and never seems to progress beyond that.

How to potentially fix bad battery drain/heat problems	"So, when I first got my S22 Ultra, I had a major problem with heat and battery drain. Well, I downloaded an app to show me what's using the most battery, and it turns out it was Google Services Framework, which deals with syncing stuff. Well, many days to a week later, the syncing is long over with and I still have the issue.
Well, I went into the apps, tapped the button where you can sort, and enabled Show System Apps. I cleared data of both Google Play Services and Google Service Framework, and ever sense then my battery life has been absolutely amazing. It's lasted from 100% at 7 AM to 36% 11:25 PM.
Unfortunately, doing those signs you out of all Google related apps and some other 3rd party apps. I had to factory reset my Galaxy Watch4 because my phone couldn't find it because of it. Now all is good and everything is amazing with this phone.

Considering switching from iPhone 11	I’ve been having issues with my iPhone and I am likely switching to android from Apple. I’ve narrowed my choices down to the Pixel 6 (non-pro) and the S22. I would like to get the S22, but I am unsure if the extra 200$ is worth the slight upgrade. If anyone has any experience to share, a response would be appreciated.	N
Text to Speech	I just switched to Galaxy not that long ago from iPhone and I love it way more already. One feature I'm missing though from iPhone how easy it was to highlight any text and press that speak button and it'll read it to me while I'm doing something else. Anyone know how to do that on here besides the TalkBack feature?	N
Is anyone genuinely satisfied with their s22 Ultra?	"I have been following the s22 thread and needless to say people seems mostly unsatisfied with the countless bugs this phone has to offer. I personally decided to switch after experiencing with a friend's s21ultra and i have been regretting it since.
[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/ua1ktu)"	N
Anyone here find it hard not to upgrade to S22 ultra with trade in to be $1000?	"This would be first time attempting ""yearly upgrades"". I got this phone last year shy of $1200. 
With trade in to be $1000,  I will practically get a brand new phone for $189.
Is it worth it? Primary reason is s22 ultra will hold value to upgrade to s23 Ultra.
I really like my phone but I feel I'm putting money on the table by not upgrading."	N
you can get the S22 ultra for less than $200 with trade in		N
S21 plus or S22?	so im gonna switch from my s10 and i care a lot about the battery, so that less battery worth it or i should go instead to the s21 plus?	N
I was offered a brand new, sealed S22 Ultra 256 GB for my Fold 3	And I rejected the offer 😁👍	N

S22 users - prefered network setting?	"I remember that setting being available when I first got the S22U but now it's gone.

Just saw a commercial last night for this trade in program. My family uses the Unlimited &amp; More(SM) plan on 3 lines. 
Is it true I can trade in some old phones for everyone to get a S22?!
I have a S4, S6, &amp; a S7 Edge (w/ cracked screen). AT&amp;T trade in page says they are worth the required minimum of $35 ea. Not sure what to expect from this trade in deal, or how it would affect the plan. Any insight is appreciated!"	N

I tracked the battery usage of my Exynos S22 for 2 months. Here's what I found.	"# Context
I pre-ordered an unlocked 256G Exynos base S22 and received it on March 3. I upgraded from a Note9, and while I really love this phone, the battery life left a lot to be desired. So I started obsessively tracking my battery usage to look at the battery performance systematically and statistically. This post is actually my third (and hopefully last) post on this topic.
At one point, the battery was so bad that I reached out to Samsung support and got my phone exchanged for another unit, and even the Samsung CS rep thought that my phone's battery was terrible and got it exchanged for me right away. I had to send in my first unit to get my replacement unit, and sent in my first unit on March 25 and got my 2nd unit on April 10. So although there is a 2-week blank period of when I was waiting for my replacement unit, I tracked my battery usage almost daily starting from March 5 until today, April 24. 
This means that I went through 4 software versions throughout my experiment:
* Out-of-the-box software
* March GOS update, received on March 11
* First April update, released on April 1, received on April 10 (the day I got my 2nd unit)
* Second April update, received April 19
I also don't game at all on my phone, and as a digital privacy advocate, I use mainly open source apps from F-droid or stock Samsung apps, don't use any social media except for reddit, have location services disabled at all times except for when I use apps that require it, have the Google app disabled, and many of the Google-related functions disabled. I also uninstalled everything Facebook related and some other bloatware via adb.
# Approach
I wanted to look at my battery usage patterns by answering the 3 questions:
1. Is there any statistically significant difference between my first unit and my replacement unit?
2. How much battery is drained overnight by idle drain?
3. How much active SOT do I get on average? 
I switched up my phone's configurations every now and then, but my base configurations throughout my experiment were:
* Phone setup from scratch with no SmartSwitch
* Charge level capped to 85% from protect battery setting
* Adaptive battery: On
* Processing speed: Optimized
* Adaptive power saving: On
* Super fast charging: On (Using official 25W charger)
* Fast wireless charging: On (Using official Samsung duo wireless charger)
* Dark mode: On
* Adaptive brightness: On
* Motion smoothness: Adaptive
* Eye comfort shield: Sunset to sunrise
* Screen mode: Vivid
* Bluetooth: On
* NFC: Off
* Location: Off
* VoLTE: On
* Wi-Fi Calling: On
* Wi-Fi power saving mode: On
* Bluetooth: On (always connected to my Garmin watch)

# Findings
&gt; Is there any statistically significant difference between my first unit and my replacement unit?
* **There didn't seem to be a drastic difference between my first unit and my second unit**, although I can't be 100% sure since I wasn't able to run the experiment with identical settings on both units simultaneously. 
&gt; How much battery is drained overnight by idle drain? (Graph 1)
* **My overnight idle drain was an average of 1.9%/hr, with a max of 4.6%/hr and 0.4%/hr**. 
* I initially got terrible overnight idle drain with 4.6%/hr (33% drained after 7:09h), but this was due to a bug on the Exynos models where the device wouldn't go to deep sleep if the WiFi module was on. 
* Turning off WiFi reduced it to 1.4%/hr (see March 9), and then the March GOS update also helped reduce idle drain to 1.7%/hr with WiFi on (see March 12). 
* I tried putting my phone on airplane mode on March 17, and saw that the hourly drain was only 0.4%/hr, so I knew that it could be better.
* I got 1.3%/hr with 4G on April 10 on my second device with the first April update, which meant my second unit wasn't much better than my first unit.
* I experimented with putting my phone on battery saver mode overnight on both WiFi and 4G, and got 1.7%/hr and 1.3%/hr respectively, meaning **battery saver mode didn't really help idle drain.**
* I accidentally went to sleep with my Bluetooth headphones connected on April 14, which spiked up the hourly drain to 4.3%/hr. 
* The second April update on April 20 finally fixed the Exynos WiFi bug, and hourly drain has been reduced to 1.2%/hr and 0.9%/hr even on WiFi
* For some reason, the hourly drain last night on April 24 was 13%/hr, but my guess is that since the phone was at 14% when I went to bed, and as many here have stated, the last percentages drop down extremely fast. Therefore, the last 10% drained very quickly overnight, and it was at 1% when I woke up this morning.
&gt; How much active SOT do I get on average? 
* **My active SOT was an average of 2.6h, with a max of 4.4h and a min of 1.3h.** 
* Since I mostly charged up to 85%, I extrapolated my battery usage data points to a 100% and assuming linearity, and got a **predicted average SOT of 3:15h on my first unit and 3:38h on my second unit**. I suspect the 23 minute difference is due to software differences and not hardware differences, but this can't be proven.
* [Worst - battery usage screenshot for April 19, 1:16h active SOT](https://imgur.com/kBIGkDk) - On this day, something with Bixby was apparently acting up. Even though Bixby Voice was active for less than 1m, it took up the most of my battery at 5.6% from just sitting in the background. Not sure why this happened, but it hasn't happened since.
* Looking at some people who are getting 5 or even 8 hours of SOT on their Exynos S22s on this sub, I noticed a common pattern: *Most of the great active SOTs are from people who are constantly using their phones, where they have a high active SOT % per total uptime.* This gave me the hypothesis that ***my battery life issue is not that my phone's battery drains quickly while I'm using the phone, but rather that my phone drains too much in idle that the battery is drained even before I can use it in the first place.***
* [Best - battery usage screenshot for April 23, 4:23h active SOT](https://imgur.com/uwxGibv) To test the hypothesis, I actively tried to use my phone as much as I could on April 23, to keep the screen on more than off as much as I could. What do you know, **this was when I finally got more than 4 hours of SOT after 2 months of using the phone.**
* This hypothesis was further confirmed by plotting active SOT vs.% of active SOT per total uptime (graph 4), which shows a positive correlation with a R^2 value of 0.19 for my first unit and 0.35 for my second. Not the strongest evidence, but still enough to make you think.
# Conclusion
* I still don't think the battery life of the base S22 Exynos is great, but at least I know that the issue is more with idle drain than how much battery is drained when I'm actively using it. The second April update also was a huge improvement in the idle drain, so I'm cautiously optimistic that this can be improved from future updates. I'm still not very happy with the battery life, but now it's at a point where I can at least use it for 
* The most significant improvements of my battery life was 1) turning off 5G, 2) keeping my phone up-to-date
* For the time being, I've solved my battery anxiety by purchasing the [Samsung 25W Wireless Portable Battery](https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/mobile-accessories/phones/25w-wireless-portable-battery--silver-eb-u3300xjegus/) and always carrying it around with me. If you have battery anxiety, I suggest you do the same. 
* Looking on the bright side, battery issues can be mitigated by carrying around a battery pack, but OS-level bugs or other hardware issues (ex: bad camera) can't. So maybe it's not too bad. I also intentionally don't trickle-charge during the day to elongate my battery lifespan, but if you have access to a charger, maybe just charge during the day for your peace of mind and don't bother with obsessively tracking your battery for 2 months like me.
This was a very long post, but I hope it's informative and helpful for some.

Cracked my s22 +. Replacement nightmare.	Phone cracked. I have Samsung care + Took it in for a repair and the repair place severed the camera cable. And made the screen worse. The advised me to put in for a replacement. Samsung said they would have the phone in within three to five business days. 14 days later they are still saying the same thing. idk what to do	N
Is it worth upgrading from the S9 to the S22?	Hey everyone! Curious about whether I should upgrade my S9 to the S22 or just hang on to it. There is nothibg wrong with it, but I figured I should probably trade it in while they will still offer me 200 for it. The camera looks awesome, and im pretty sure the battery is still bigger than what I have now. Any thoughts?	N
Samsung Galaxy S21 FE, S22+ or S22 Ultra	"So as title says i'm wondering which one of this devices should i choose. (In my country i have only Exynos version avaible, except S21 Fe, which have Snapdragon).
Also i heard somewhere that S22+ has worse performance than regular S22, is that true?"	N
Micro scratches on S22 Ultra screen after 2 days	These things don't usually bother me, I got my S22U a couple days ago and ordered some screen protectors on Amazon that are arriving Monday. Anyway I was inspecting the phone today and noticed 2 decently long micro scratches on the screen. Is there anyway to get rid of these? Has anyone else experienced this phone scratching easier than others? I always have it in an individual pocket with nothing in it.	N
My experience with the S22 Ultra from a flip/iPhone user perspective	"Context: My perspective comes from a user who uses an iPhone 13 pro and the Z Flip 3. The Z flip was switched over to the S22U for clarity. 
The Good:
Camera: Easily matches my 13 pro with a hint of more detail
Build quality: My Z Flip 3 hasn't cracked or anything but the S22U is just leagues better in terms of quality which is more in line with the 13 pro. 
Charging: Dear God, I've missed the super fast charging. It wasn't available on my z flip 3 and having it back made a world of difference. 
Battery Life: My flip lasted about 4-5 SOT if I played light games and listened to podcast compared to my iPhone which lasted me all day playing pokemon Unite. The battery with the ultra is just too damn good... easy 7-9 hours SOT between demanding games, browsing, and podcasts. 
SPen: This is literally my first ""note"" but that pen is just so convenient. I usually listen to podcast or watch anime and controlling my phone with the just a wave of my hand like a conductor hits different. 
The Bad:
The the curve: I'm actually cool with the curve... after I bought a spigen case for it. 
The noteworthy:
Smart switch: using it actually screwed over my battery at the start. It would last about 4-5 SOT. In order to fix that I 
^
Reset all settings (not factory reset)&gt; turn phone off&gt; held volume up and side key as it turn on till I saw a retro list&gt;  clear cache&gt; finally reboot device. 
^
It fixed whatever issue using smart switch caused for me, can't fully speak y'all... hope it helps though. 
Bixby routines:
For those who wanna preserve their battery I present to you this routine
If
Charging status:on
Then:
Protect battery: on
It keeps battery level at 85 for those who may ask^
Goodlock:
If you're not using good lock you're missing out.
The Conclusion. 
Given the features, performance, battery life, and camera. I would say this phone is the complete package for everything you want and then some. The flip 3 was an underpowered nostalgic mess. I loved it but it had to many compromises that I couldn’t settle with. The S22U however, is something you can settle with knowing that it matches with Apple and can do so much more(*cough* reverse wireless charging *cough*). I still love my Iphone for its simplicity but if I had to recommend a top of the line phone for somebody...it'd be the Ultra if they didn't care about simplicity from the IPhone.

Upgrading from Oneplus 6 to S22	I currently use a Oneplus 6 and am thinking of upgrading to an s22 (exynos). I know everyone says the battery is shit on the S22, but I get by fine with my OP6 (3300MAh). So would I be guaranteed to get longer battery life from the S22 or is it more of a battery optimisation issue?	N
Is the battery in the S22 as bad as people are saying?	"I want to swap my S21 Ultra out for a regular S22 as I'm really tired of this big ass phone. But I noticed some people here have been complaining about battery life on the regular S22. Is it really that bad?
Edit: i think with how i use my phone, and how much i SHOULD be using my phone, especially with some bixby routines set up, itll be perfectly fine and may only require a short 30 minute charge at home during lunch on high use days.
Edit 2: A lot of you are comparing the S21U to the S22. I'm not an idiot. I understand the S22 will have worse battery life than the 21U because of size. That isn't what im asking. 
I'm also not talking about the S22+ or S22U like a lot of you are talking about either. I am specifically talking about the snapdragon 6.1in regular S22."	N

Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, 512gb	With any of the Samsung S22 Ultra. There's isn't any memory card slot at all. The device has it built in. You must purchase it together. Another thing.

Camera selection on S22/S22+	This may be different on the Ultra but should be the same for the two lower models. I experimented on my S22 and confirmed the standard Photo setting uses the UW camera at the .6 setting as expected and the main camera at the 1 setting, but continues using the main camera at the 3 setting (applying a digital zoom presumably) all the way up to 10x, when it switches to the telephoto camera. Pro mode allows me to choose the telephoto camera starting at 3x up to 12x. Is there any way to dictate which camera is used in Photo mode other than by zooming, or any way to set the camera app to default to Pro mode? I'd prefer to avoid digital zoom as much as I can. I do have Expert Raw installed also but don't really use it.ThanksDanGalaxy S22 SM-S901U on Xfinity MobileSolved!Go to Solution.	N

Dual Sim MMS and Google messages	I just got the Galaxy s22 ultra and I'm really loving the phone. I was excited to see that Google messages was the default messaging app. However I have a dual SIM setup and I have SIM one as my phone and data Sim, with Sim 2 as a passive sim. Calls and single texts come through fine on both Sims . Every once in awhile I will receive a group text message or picture on Sim 2, and when I do it is asking me to switch data Sims to be able to view the message (it comes through as an MMS). When I use Samsung messages this doesn't happen, it automatically downloads.Does anyone have a solution to make Google messages operate like Samsung messages so that I don't have to switch the data on the Sims to get an MMS message in Google messages on my second Sim?

Anyone know why? For example, I'm missing the "melting" emoji I used quite frequently. They're newish emojis but they don't seem to exist on my phone 🤔	N
Moving secure folder to new S22 Ulta	Is there an easy way to move items from my old phone's secure folder to my new one? Everything I've seen says to move things out of the secure folder and then to back them up and download but once you move them out of the secure folder they go to random places, there's no way to designate where they go so you have to hunt them down.There seems like there should be an easier way to do it.

Taking Pictures	Does anyone know if this phones camera has a feature that video captures a second b4 a picture is taken.

S22 Ultra - Periscope / 10x Zoom Uses Hybrid Pictures?	Went to my son's soccer game this afternoon and found when using the 10x periscope zoom that there are pictures that come out exactly like they should (like the first 2 photos), but all others appears like they are using some kind of hybrid of 10x zoom overlaid with 1x photos from the108 MP main sensor. This appears to be similar to what Google was doing with their main sensor and ultra wide to prevent blurry pictures. But in my case here, these photos are garbage, where they place a complete halo blur around subjects (the players in these photos). I've seen this before, thought it was just me, but it is distracting and I would like to know how to turn off this hybrid feature.	N
Samsung Galaxy S22 USB-C mic with headset	Hi everyoneFor my job, I have to use a Samsung S22 with a USB-C microphone (iRig) and a Bluetooth headset (Jabra Move).It's working but only if I connect them in a precise order. I have to connect at first the microphone USB-C and after, the headset. If I connect the USB-C after, I get no sound in the headset, it's recording though.Is that possible to configure in my phone something ? The USB-C devices shouldn't have the priority. The Bluetooth must have the priority.Thanks !	N
Still like my Galaxy S22	I see reviews about the battery issues.I honestly think it'll last if we close every app, optimize from device care and I never leave my location on because that takes up the battery, plus the wifi (but that shouldn't be a problem unless you know what to do with the device. I just don't like staying on the phone while it's charging... my phone would be hot and I don't want to burn the battery... what do you guys think?	N

Suggestion to improve audio output quality	Hello, I'm a S22 owner, coming from a zenfone 8. I like the new phone as it feels like an upgrade overall, except for one thing: lack of bass and deepness from the main speaker. The asus probably was better designed to have a richer and more extensive speaker, but I have a suggestion for you, that could likely be implemented even with just a software update.I measured with a professional sound level meter the output (using a frequency sweep sample) of my S22, the previous zenfone 8 and, just as a reference, an old Iphone X (which also has a better quality to my ears compared to the S22, almost close to the zenfone 8).The results were as expected, with the zenfone 8 able to reproduce lower frequencies compared to the S22. I was surprised instead for the Iphone result, a really smart solution that you could also implement (hopefully with an update): the frequency range that the smartphone is not able to reproduce due to physical reason is shifted. I saw, indeed, that the range e.g. from 50 to 150Hz was shifted above 150Hz (I don't remember exactly the numbers), resulting in a similar spectrum to the s22, while reproducing a song making a quite big difference.Tell me your opinion and if it could be a feasible thing to do.Thankyou!

Why is S22 Ultra in stock at every Bestbuy but my pre-order direct from Samsung is still delayed?!?	Question for Samsung:Do you have any color of S22 Ultra in stock? If so, I would like to change the color of my pre-order so I can get a phone shipped ASAP. At this point I don't care about color. I just really need a phone.Also, its really bad customer service to keep pushing out estimated delivery dates every time the date gets within a week. If you don't have a real delivery date then just say so.	N
Unable to retrieve previously purchased Themes	I recently upgraded to the S22 Ultra from the Note 10+ and there were a few themes that I purchased on the Note that I cannot access or have the option to download on the S22.

Free charger	Hi, I just got my new s22 today,It is a great phone, I love it so far.

I contacted one customer agent via chat a moment ago, she/he is helping me with this. If you have any updates, please let me know. Thanks. My email is zhiw.ma@gmail.com	N

No microSD card	No microSD card - no more Samsung!I have been a happy customer for Samsung the last decade. When my Note20 Ultra is worn out I go for anything but Samsung.Why does Samsung cater for the toy market only? I carry a lot of video footage, 30.000 music tracks (no, I DON'T want streaming, I have my own rips that no one can censor) so SD is a must also for fast backup to harddisk (no, I DON'T want the toy cloud storage which can be censored and shutdown for no and any reason), I DON'T want to be dependent on wifi.Samsung lost the edge and have gone lowest common denominator. I guess no one at Samsung decision level will ever pick up complaints like mine, the trend is for the toy market only. I have no business being angry, it's not my company, I'm just sad sad sad and frustrated.	N

Unlocked phone connectivity issues?	"Good evening s22 ultra lovers. I come to you at my witts end begging for a solution.
I have purchased an s22 ultra, unlocked, after owning a note 10+. I currently have t-mobile for my service. Where I live, I never had any issues with my mobile data signal, and 99% of the time was on 4glte. Now that I have upgraded to the unlocked s22 ultra, for some reason my phone is constantly roaming on AT&amp;T towers, in areas I know I should have t-mobile signal, 4g or 5g. I know this because after 3 days of calls with t-mobile tech support, I was able to get onto the 5g for a couple days, and then the roaming issue started again. I then went to a physical location, and had my sim replaced. This fixed my issue again for about 2 days. I'm back on ""AT&amp;T 4GLTE+ instead of t-mobile 5g, even in locations where during my brief periods of being connected, I was connected to 5g and getting speeds of 500mb/s or more. I know that at my home with wifi disabled I was able to get these speeds. Now, it's back to roaming 100% of the time. I have the latest updates, tried every combo of removing Sim, airplane mode, turning off roaming, rebooting, attempting to manually select t-mobile as my provider (it will not connect), Resetting all network settings, and factory resetting my device. Does anybody have any secrets to solve this problem? Because I'm about to just switch to AT&amp;T seeing as I'm connected to their towers all the time, albeit at horribly slow roaming speed. PLEASE HELP ME."	N

Using USB Tethering to download large game files on my PC with my S22 Ultra through TMobile 5G	"Still don't have fiber in my area and I refuse to work with Comcast, so the alternative to updating my games quickly is using my TMobile 5G connection on my S22 Ultra through USB Tethering. I can get an average of about a half-gig of bandwidth through T-Mobile 5G during non-peak hours. Sometimes I have to do ""ipconfig /flushdns"" when I switch from LAN to USB tethering, and then reload blizzard, but it works pretty well. Just a tip in case anyone is stuck with a slower ISP. The 5G modem on this phone is really solid/stable for using as an internet connection on my PC. Please note that I only to this at the end of my billing cycles, so I am not using my monthly high-speed bandwidth allotment for the month. TMobile never actually cuts my 5G off after my high speed bandwidth for the month runs out. I am just de-prioritized. So whatever extra high speed data they'll give me at the end of the month, I'll take it.

Bitwarden is slow opening from keyboard	"Edit: solved by reinstalling Gboard and Bitwarden.
Hello, does anyone else use bitwarden an exciting the following problem?
When I tap into a username/password box, at the top of the keyboard there will be entries for the specific site I need, those work fine. If there are not specific entries, there's a generic bitwarden entry to tap that will open the app so you can search for and pick the entry you want. When using the generic option it takes like 2 seconds to open bitwarden and I get impatient and tap it like 3-4 times, which ends up opening the app 3-4 times all layered on top of each other.

Are the US unlocked and Canadian versions the same?	"I am in Canada but travelling to the US next week for work. I was going to take advantage of the samsung trade in program. They will give me $1000USD for my ZF3, and samsung canada will only give me $680CAD. So over a $500 swing.
Is the unlocked US version the same as the Canadian version? I just want to make sure I have all the correct bands.
I assume the software would be the same?

After 6 years with various Google Pixel phones, I decided to make a switch to the Galaxy phone. Here are my opinions	"TLDR; This phone is freaking awesome and I highly recommend anyone hesitant to leave their Pixel phones (or any phone) behind for a Galaxy phone.
Before making the switch, I crawled through this sub and any Galaxy-related subs looking for any advice and opinions from people who also made a move from another phone. So I guess I'm writing this in case anyone out there is going through what I went through before getting the base Galaxy S22.
I LOVED the Pixel line. I got the first one when it came out based on a freaking ad I saw while watching football one Sunday. I knew instantly this was the phone I've been looking for. I then decided to upgrade to the Pixel 3 and that was the best phone I've ever owned. I loved it. It was the perfect size along with all the bells and whistles I've come to love about the Pixel line. But the hardware eventually started failing me and it was time to leave it behind.
Then I got the Pixel 6 thinking that this was the next step in smartphone technology. A Google-made SoC, a bigger camera sensor, 90hz screen, the vanilla Android experience. It was all lined up to be the phone of my dreams! Then I actually got it and boy was I unpleasantly surprised. I knew the phone was gonna be big but damn was it a big phone. The camera left A LOT to be desired. The screen seemed washed out. The speakers were tinny and had to blast the volume just to hear something. The under the screen fingerprint reader was nothing compared to the one on the back. A lot of the Pixel specific features are region locked like call screening as I don't live in the countries that offer it. I felt like I had to learn to love it instead of actually loving it the way I did with the previous Pixel phones. I felt like I made a huge mistake.
Over the last few weeks I started exploring other phones, from the Sony Xperia (my first love before the Pixel came out) to the new Galaxy S22 phones to even an iPhone. It was an open market for my next phone. The Galaxy S22 started catching my eye. I've heard horror stories from people who've had a Galaxy phone so I was very skeptical. But I knew that the size of the base Galaxy S22 was the right one for me since I've always liked smaller phones.
I got the phone but was still skeptical but I came in with an open mind. What I then learned was just how incredible this phone is. It's a full-fledged phone in a small package. The OS is just so feature packed and so much fun to dig through. The options and freedom they give you to make this phone a unique experience is nothing like what you get from a Pixel phone. There's just so so so much to go through in this phone. It's so much fun to dig through every corner and see what else you can customize. It's the feeling I had when I got the Pixel 3. I'm in love all over again.
Not to mention the camera is just as capable as the Pixel phones. If you're a pixel peeper then you could probably tell me how the Pixel is better but I'm not like that and I like the output I've been getting from the Galaxy S22.
This is such a fun phone to have and I recommend it to anyone out there looking for a new Android phone. The bloatware isn't that big of a deal as you can always hide them if you don't want them (something Pixels don't let you do).
If you're like me and want to make a switch from a Pixel phone but too afraid to leave that phone line behind, give this a shot and see how you feel. I have no doubt you'll fall in love with it.
Just hope this finds eyes to help them make a decision I was afraid to make myself.
Enjoy your Galaxy phones!"	N

How to disable OneUi 4.1 / Android 12 "switch app by swiping bottom of the screen" feature	"I'm not sure this is a feature of OneUI 4.1 or Android 11/12, but ever since upgrading to a Galaxy S22 from Galaxy S10 which ran OneUI 2.5 + Android 10, I've noticed this new feature where swiping left or right near the bottom of the screen will switch to next or previous open app. This is extremely annoying when I actually want to perform a swiping action within the current app, but can't because the switch app feature takes over. Can someone please suggest a way to disable this feature?

[Video example 2](https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/702988410) here you can see my Nav Bar settings. Again, swiping left takes me to the previous app. Also notice that a short swipe and drag takes me to the Current Apps (which should be the job of verticle swipe on the left side). As a result, many time when I try to swipe up on the *right* side to go back, I accidentally end up back at the home screen. These two settings are SUPER annoying."	N
Does anyone have Visual Voicemail integrated into their Google Phone app?	"I have a 2yr. old S20+ that has the Visual Voicemail integrated right into the Google Phone app as shown in picture. However, I cannot get VV to show in the same Google Phone app on my brand-new S22U. Does everyone else have VV integrated into their Google Phone app, or is it exclusively a separate app now?  BTW, I bought the phone from my cellular provider, Google Fi.

S22 or plus?	I know this question has been asked many times but I'm curious after a few months and the new updates what your s22 / plus performance is like. How's the battery? That's my biggest concern. The plus looks too big and is €200 more expensive but if it gives me 2 more hours of screen time it's worth it, I think. I'm in Europe so will receive the Exynos version.. What do you guys advise?	N
Is unlocked S22+ from Samsung.com (USA) a global unlocked model?	"Hi all,

Is the S22 Ultra 128gb model worth it?	"Okay so last night my family last minute got us into a new family plan with Verizon and they got me the S22 Ultra but the 128gb model. I did not expect them to get the new phones otherwise I would have went with them and picked out the 256gb model myself.
So the question is should I take this galaxy back, pay a $50 restocking fee + the difference for the 256gb model?
For those with the 128gb how do you manage with storage? 
Currently I have an old galaxy A70 with 128gb internal and 128gb external and it took me just over 15 months to max out both storages.
I dont really take that many photos or videos mostly because my A70 camera is crap but even then I probably wouldnt take any more than 100 pictures a year.
Most of my storage consists of music and movies about 45gb of music/movies downloaded for offline use, 15gb in mobile gaming, 20gb of pictures and videos and that would already be close to 80% of the Ultras storage however, now that I have Verizon again I probably dont need to download much content for offline use because the Internet on Verizon is better and not Throttled like T-mobile."

Mobile Data Button Toggle	I just got my s22 a few days ago and since I don't have unlimited data I turn it on and off throughout the day.

Confirming S22 straps will fit Flip strap case	"If you want a new strap (or just  to swap out while washing cause these get a bit manky) then you can definitely use the new S22 straps.
As a [photo comparison](https://i.imgur.com/zTSGSUP.jpg) I've got a Samsung Marvel strap, an original ZFlip strap and a new S22 strap - all from Samsung UK. The Marvel one was a bit longer and the S22 one is the same size but not noticed any issues with the extra length. 
Oddly the S22 green strap case is currently only £12 on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B09N9ZGVRS)\- compared to £16 on Samsung for the other straps on their own or £20+ for a case.
Looks like more straps are planned for the S22 (I'm eyeing up the [Toy Story Claw](https://images.samsung.com/is/image/samsung/assets/uk/explore/brand/galaxy-s22-collaboration-accessories/mx0142_explore_galaxy-s22-phone-accessories_article-card-slide1-15_pc_406x554.jpg?$406_554_PNG$) strap) but Samsung is just [showing pictures](https://www.samsung.com/uk/explore/brand/galaxy-s22-collaboration-accessories/) with no links to order yet.
ETA: I tweeted them about The Claw strap and despite being advertised on their website they don't sell it nor can they even say who would be selling it!
""This particular strap isn't available directly from ourselves, so we'd recommend trying a reputable, third party retailer. We hope you manage to find one!""
Side note - anyone in the UK want a S22 white silicone case (no strap) then I'll send it for the postage costs."	N

What crackhead designed the buttons on the s22?	"Not only is there no home button so you have to double tap the screen, which you get used to after a little. What you don't get used to is that the power button is on the same side as the volume so when you go to turn the volume down you accidentally turn your phone off. And for some reason you have to hold all 3 buttons to turn it off, WTF why not just let the power button stay as it is. Its bad enough you removed the headphone jack like apple did but now you're ruining everything else like them to..

Samsung Screen Protectors	Every time I place an order with Samsung I check the "get it by" date. This happened with my S22 Ultra now it's happening again with Samsung Screen Protectors.Although It seems it doesn't matter what you order there's a BIG difference between the "get it by" date posted next to the description of the item you're ordering and the actual date you physically receive it.This "get it by" date is a key factor for placing an order with Samsung. You TRUST the "get it by" date, love the selection of Samsung products and the free shipping so you go ahead and place an order.After you do place an order and receive a confirmation email you anticipate the delivery. Then low and behold you get an email stating your order is delayed and you'll now receive it at a later date. Later than originally stated date. MUCH later.The point is it's happening to literally thousands is users and Samsung, seemingly, isn't doing anything to address the problem.Even though I'm just talking about Samsung Screen Protectors it's seriously aggravating.

Stuck in her mint mobile sim and it looked good so flashed the unlocked firmware and away she went.

Why are there ZERO rugged cases for the S22 Ultra?	All I want is a heavy duty case (a la old school Otterbox) with RAISED EDGES ALL THE WAY AROUND the dang screen. It seems as though every case manufacturer designed their "rugged" cases to be flush/nearly flush with the sides of the S22 Ultra in order to accommodate the curved screen. Well, what if I don't care about that and just want something that will bounce happily off of the ground no matter how it lands? I've purchased three cases so far, and the Armadillotek/Casebourn has the highest sides of the three, but it's still pathetically low compared to my old Otterbox on my LG G6. It's so frustrating - someone please just make a big, bulky, idiot-proof case!	N

S Pen issues (and some other)	"I have the Exynos version, latest updates as of today. I'm wondering if I got a dud or anyone else is having these issues. No case, no screen protector.
The S pen requires a decent amount of pressure to register. I can easily slide it over the screen without it registering. If I'm writing or drawing the lines keep breaking [(pic from notes)](https://i.imgur.com/YJ5j4yK.jpg). Trying to make use of the pressure sensitivity in apps like infinite painter or Autodesk sketchbook is awful as I already need to push quite hard just to make it register in the first place. Compared to the S pen on the Tab S8+ it's just terrible.
The fingerprint reader has not been good in my experience. It regularly takes 2-3 attempts to unlock my phone. I have rescanned the fingerprints multiple times without much improvement.
Both cellular and Wi-Fi reception are subpar. Getting 1-2 bars in an area with full 5G coverage. The Wi-Fi reception is significantly worse than on my old LG G7, as in I have 2 bars on the Wi-Fi in the room next to the router, and no signal just outside my house."	N
Will the S22 Series always Factory Reset if you Manipulate the SIM/eSIM cards?	"So I Am trying to setup Dual SIM - not sure if I Am pairing T-Mobile/T-Mobile or Other carrier/T-Mobile just yet.  
I currently don't have eSIM, only physical. The other carrier requires a physical SIM so no eSIM.
If I put in my physical SIM, activate my device with the other carrier, then put in my T-Mobile SIM  card and convert to eSIM ( I think they said the self-service option is back, I DO NOT want to have to contact ANYONE to perform a SIM swap as I see fit, I love self-service!) will the phone restart and erase? 
Or say I use my physical T-Mobile, setup device, convert to eSIM, then put in the other carrier physical SIM
Just trying to figure out what SIM change processes cause the device to basically factory reset so I know how to move forward....
Or I could use the other carrier SIM and setup then convert my T-Mobile physical SIM online and add it that way I guess - I just don't want the S22 to factory reset after manipulating the SIM settings..
Smh why are they requiring a SIM to setup the phone? I see you can bypass it but you really don't bypass it if once you put in a SIM(the same for eSIM?) the device restarts and erases your settings - DUMB! Restarting to load carrier sku is one thing but to ERASE....how inconvenient."	N
Indoor kid photos on s22 Ultra (Is gcam a solution?)	"I'm currently on a buggy Pixel 6 pro and really want to migrate to the S22 Ultra. My biggest concern is getting decent photos of my 2 and 3 year old girls, especially indoors. I had a S21 and frankly, it was a blurry, soft mess in this situation. My wife's iphone 12 mini takes much better photos in this situation as well.
Has anyone found a good setting to get high quality photos of moving subjects in moderate light on the s22 ultra? I've seen other threads where the answer is basically ""No"". But I haven't seen any threads where gcam has been tested for this. Has anyone tried gcam on moving subjects?
My priority is quick and good quality. I don't want to need to open the pro app and adjust shutter speed every time, I often have just a few seconds to catch a cute moment and anything beyond a camera shortcut and immediately taking photos isn't an option. I also don't want to screenshot from video, that sounds both cumbersome and lowered quality.
My pixel has taken such consistent photos, I may just need to stick it out and hope the bugs continue to get better. And live with envy of face unlock, a fast fingerprint reader, and the variety of other improvements on the ultra. Thanks in advance!

S22 (Exynos) battery issue/some tips?	"Hey, 
I have my base S22 for 5 days now. I love the phone! The weight, size, display, just everything! Expect for.. battery. It's not good. The main problem for me seems to be idle drain. 
https://imgur.com/a/6opdNPC
https://imgur.com/a/gVbpryM
Look at the screenshots. One day, I've got 5h of SOT. For me, amazing. But that day I unplugged the phone at abt. 12 and plugged back before the night, which means I was using my phone a lot, therefore it didn't have much time to drain while off. The second screenshot is from today. I've left my phone overnight, today at 7 a.m I charged it a bit. (you can see the battery charge from 70 to 85%). I haven't used it a lot today and look how much it drained. And I have no idea why. Overnight it drained about 15%. Just writing this post for 10mins dropped 3%. 
I am thinking of returning it. Do you have any tips on how to increase the battery life (or decrease idle drain)?"	N

S22+ vs S22 ultra	"Currently holding the beast Galaxy Note 10+, went to official service 2 times(battery replacement, and button replacement, cause of glue-ultraviolet based screen protector), long story, but anyway, phone is perfect  
Thinking about getting S22+ or Ultra. The size of the phone doesn't consider me, Note10+ is the same size as S22 ultra  
In my country, Ultra costs about 1450 $, and Plus costs about 1265$  
The questions is, does Ultra worth extra 200$?  
1. What is important for me:  
Screen size(Not a big difference)
2. Battery life(500 mah is a kinda good difference, but if S22 ultra refresh rate is as same as S22 plus(considering they both drop to 24/48 hz all the time), which would be better?
3. Gaming performance(Saw some tests, s22+ seems more stable, but ultra got more power) + Ram. My Note10+ has 12gb, getting s22 plus will seem as downgrade. Do you guys feel some real usage of more RAM storage? Everytime I join to the settings on my note10+ it seems like 6 gigs is used  
Camera is not important for me, but 200$ difference, especially when u anyway overpay seems not so huge. Flat screen would be better, but curved display doesn't bother me, if the screen protector doesn't have black frames around it  
I know I kinda answered some questions by myself, but what do u guys think about gaming, extra ram, some camera bonuses, screen size and battery for extra 200$?  
Youtube videos seems kinda empty, sadly for samsung"	N

S22 Ultra - flip case opinions/alternatives?	"I'm planning on getting the s22 ultra soon-ish (once I finish saving up haha), and I've been considering my case options. 
I'm not very hard on phones, so minor protection is fine. Right now I use a pixel 4xl (very buggy, hence the upgrading), and I do not use a case or screen protector (because the phone seems to be warped and no screen protectors will fit...). My screen's been scratched a few times and the glass in the corner is chipped, but I've never broken a phone from dropping it. 
Since most of my drops occur when transporting the phone, not when using it, I was thinking of getting a case with a cover and not using a screen protector (because of the rounded edges). 
A few questions for the group:
* If you've used the flip case, how was it? Does it interfere with using the phone?
* Are there any other cases that have a flip cover that people have liked?
* Do screen protectors actually impact using the edge functionality at all? Or make it less comfortable? 
Thanks in advance!"	N
S22 Ultra or S22+ for Newbie Content Creator	"I've had a Note 9 for almost three years.  My screen cracked this past November.  So now I'm in the market for a new phone, but this time around I want to use it to double for video content creation.  I considered a cheap phone Pixel 5a or similar and maybe $$$ into a camera, but I don't know what I don't know about cameras yet and I really want to set and meet some content creation milestones to support my business through the Summer.  
With trade-in credit, A 256G 22 Ultra is $779 and the 22 Plus is $639.  Would you consider these prices a good deal.  Samsung's website shows trade-in credit of $425 + $100 rebate on the Ultra and trade-in credit of $360 + $50 rebate on the Plus.  Either would be a nice step up from my Note 9.  Anyone using either for a similar purpose of content creation?  The 100x zoom would be lost on me, but what other positives would steer someone toward the Ultra for video content creation?"	N
s22 Ultra or fold 4??	"So the time has come for me to buy a new phone.

Should I pull the trigger on the s22 Ultra or just wait for the fold? Will Samsung take the Ultra as trade in for the fold if i do get it??"	N
How do you like your S22 Ultra?	"Looking to upgrade my buggy S21 Ultra but have read a concerning amount of negative reviews on the S22U, specifically on battery life (which is great on my S21U) and on lagginess (again, no issue on S21U). 
My issue with my S21U is that sometimes it won't connect to 5G or 4G, it'll say E, while my sister's S21 says 5G. Also, sometimes the screen will completely freeze, requiring restart. Last week I had to restart my S21U at least 4 times to fix the frozen screen or no 5G/4G signal in areas I should have signal"	N

Samsung and Google have colluded to gimp the app. The supposed Samsung "Visual Voicemail" isn't visual at all. The functionality I had with the S21 Ultra is gone on the S22 Ultra and I feel like a fool for buying the phone and believing the lies.This will be the last device I buy from Samsung, including fridges and washing machines and whatever.They lied to us, and are still lying, they have this really weird fixation on control of our devices.Apple is starting to look pretty tasty compared to this cow patty.What do we want?

S22 Ultra Screen protector	I just installed the amFilm tempered glass on my phone after using a TPU option initially. I really want happy with the TPU one I got from Amazon. I've installed screen protectors on every smartphone I've had and never experienced the TPU sliding after following all the install steps but it happened with both in the set this time. It then would bubble at the edge of my screen at the case. After watching several YouTube videos and reading reviews I decided to try the amFilm vs Whitestone Dome. Hopefully it was a good choice🤞This is the first time I've used a tempered glass option that requires a UV light. I'm excited to see how it goes! In the past when I had used tempered glass with the curved screen it would eventually peel up at the corners. I'm hoping this doesn't do that with the full adhesive it's got going on....	N

Samsung Messages	This NEEDS to be continually said, Samsung NEEDS to Transform Samsung Messages into an instant messaging app that supports RCS so that Samsung and other Android users using Google Messages can have type indicators, read receipts & chat features in both apps when they text each other.

Not sure I feelin this Relationship between Samsung and Google -	"Google oh ABC Company oh Alphabet.... - I uninstalled the Google messaging app in lieu of Samsungs own! - But this isn't why you are here this Thursday - you are here for THIS:
As a lifelong Android user who recently utilized an iPhone(12/13 mini, SE 2020) (VERY BRIEFLY, still on Android but did keep the iPad mini for an eReader) I Am disappointed in how Google dropped the ball.
Google. You want an open source, open garden with walled garden privileges and expectations....
Do you want to excel at (why did Microsoft name its spreadsheet program Excel) software or be a phone OEM hardware. Pick a struggle.
From the Popular brand name Nexus...you ran it into the ground after the Nexus 6P and you brought back the visor mode with the 6 Pixel series, when you saw the dwindle that is/was the Pixel series.
""Pixel Exclusives"" are bad for Android. We talk about fragmentation amongst other OEM's and Android software and poor updates. Google ....  
1. The moment you seen the popularity of end to end encryption and what iMessage was doing - WRITE THE CHEQUE - acquire BBM - throw in coding for SMS/MMS, re-frame it - make THIS THE ANDROID STANDARD for ALL ANDROID DEVICES - RCS requires carrier input so it will NEVER work -and quite frankly isn't consistent - but a BBM type of messaging platform would have been PERFECT competitor! End to end, needs data, awesome.  Heck even use their e-mail language somehow to bolster Gmail. Now you have a solid messaging presence on ALL ANDROID DEVICES.
2. IDK how but ""Android"" should be separate from ANY skin or UI a OEM puts on their device - so Google controls the foundation and ingredients of the cake - the OEM picks their ICING- this way ALL devices with the hardware minimums get timely updates, independent of a UI SKIN.
3. Stop with the Pixel exclusives - the hardware is not driving success. I like my Pixel 6 - but I still gravitate to my Samsung. Imagine a world where on ANDROID you have a built in call screener, built in RECORDER app, and whatever else the Pixel does that other Android devices can't. I know they tried allo or whatever, but that still wasn't the resolution and not the right approach - 
Where is the Android version of iMessage native to ALL Android devices? iPhone users grab iMessage and think about nothing else for messaging. Can you imagine Gmail backed by the power of BlackBerry e-mail services/style and ""BBM"" re-branded and fixated with SMS/MMS for backup texting -
RCS is NOT the same as iMessage. Facetime.
Google creates stuff and never sticks with it
I do think their ulterior motives supersede the true succession of Android and what it SHOULD be. iMessage has been around TOO LONG for Android to NOT have a NATIVE DEFAULT everyone uses an end to end messaging protocol app with sms/mms back-end the same way iMessage works. 
Sure the pixel gets 'fast' updates, inconsistent hardware,support, QC concerns, I mean sure the iPhone hasn't done much by way of hardware and design - but their software and their consumer approach was define and concise - 
I Am missing something, I had so many ideas and thoughts rambling in my mind the past 45 hours. I just think Android could be LOADS better from a structural perspective. It lacks cohesiveness. It lacks a brand identity because its all over the place depending on what device you get - the DEVICE(s) features should be specific to the OEM - the Android SOFTWARE should be consistent across the board for KEY elements that MAKE a phone a PHONE -
I would LOVE to log into my GMAIL account and gain access to native messaging app like iMessage, Facetime, SMS.MMS (NO RCS no)   
TLRD; Apple got it right. The carriers sell the gas, Apple makes the vehicle. The consumers fill up. Google wants to sell the gas, drill for oil, vote against green house gas emissions, protest ozone layer, outsource overseas, sell stateside, make the vehicle, take the customers info, walk away with no fill up but we got all of your data to sell mine and refine....GOOOOO PIXIE"	N

I've been using an S-Pen phone since 96'. Anyways, I bought the S7 tablet and

I'm now facing a dilemma - I have a superior writing experience on the tablet so why am I writing on a smaller screen with a thin small piece of plastic- Magnum wrapper Lifestyles please- 
Oh back to the 📫 post- so their native visual voicemail app is SO NICE! Can one of you using dual SIM enable the native visual voicemail app and tell me what happens when you call SIM 1 and SIM 2 and reject the calls and leave a voicemail? Second, be on your primary SIM and call your other number, does call waiting work? Did you get alerted of the voicemail during the call or after you hung up? Do you like chicken or fish? Can you SEND/RECEIVE sms/mms from both SIMs while on an active call?
The JOY in uninstalling the T-Mobile visual voicemail app. The voicemails are numbered in a folder and you can share them. The issue is there's no app to open the file:
TLDR; ACCESS the visual voicemail folder and rename the selected voicemail and simply add .AMR and you can now play the file natively, email it, upload it, text it... nice. Looks way better interface than carrier app. And voicemail came right through- now if someone can do those tests for me- if it works I can add my two lines on one phone and praize jezzus ..oouuuucccchhhhhh ok I typed this out on my S22 - my right thumb feels fatigued, my Ultra is charging, haven't had thumb fatigue in idk how many years- I just love the size of this thing though!! Maybe I'll keep the ultra as a second device for media and keep this one as my PHONE AND EMAIL AND TEXT I love the size. Pixel 6 be damned-

S22 Ultra Motherboard damaged in just 2 months	"I purchased my s22 ultra (snapdragon) on 10th march, from a retail shop, india.
I was watching series on the amazon prime and suddenly it rebooted. After that, when I entered password it showed *phone is starting...* And rebooted again. It kept on doing the same thing for each reboot. Problem persisted even after reset (via recovery). I couldn't even reach third step of the setup!!!
I was on April Security Patch.
It's in service center right now, waiting for the motherboard to be delivered. Luckily it's under warranty.
For a phone worth 1L Rs, such a big failure happening in just two months is not a good sign!!! I'm very disappointed. It's my first Samsung phone.

New S22	"I'm new here.
Yesterday I traded in my Pixel 6 for an S22. I took a bit of a bath on the transaction but I just couldn't last another day with 6. It's so hard to use as a daily driver; it's big, heavy, unresponsive, and clunky, and mine was infested with too many bugs.
Anyway, I realize the battery life of the S22 is not great but I'm not a power user or a gamer or anything - just old school calls, texts, browsing, not much else - so it shouldn't be too bad for me.
So this is my first Samsung; excuse my ignorance. 
If someone can suggest a charger I would appreciate it. I'm using my wife's old iphone brick and it charged from 23% to full last evening in about 75 minutes. There's a few on Amazon that are well-reviewed.
I'm not using a case right now and might just go bareback. The thing that drew me to the S22 is the size and weight - so easy to use one-handed. 
I'm a little mystified by the process of going from the blank screen to the lock screen, and then unlocking. It appears I have to tap the blank screen, which causes the fingerprint to display, then unlock? That's what I've been doing and it works but if there's a different way I'm all up for suggestions.

Samsung super fast wireless charging pad P2400	"Hi, 
I recently bought official Samsung 15w wireless charging pad for S22 Ultra. I have noticed that it takes more then 3.5 hrs to charge from 15 to 100 percent. Super fast and fast charging is enabled. It shows fast wireless charging also on lock screen while it charge. Do you think that this is okay ? Another question is that the pad has raised border and because of that phone never touches to the coil directly. Does this design affect the performance? Is this design intentional? Do let me know the speed if anyone owns this pad. Thanks"	N

Which Carrier support esim on S22?	Just got my new S22 with 1 sim slot + esim. I used to use mint mobile but found out they only support esim on iPhone or Pixel (I don't know why. I don't see any reason to not support it if my device is unlocked and is esim compatible). Any recommendation?	N
[S22 Ultra] Google Messages on Samsung lost the Reminder feature?	"I could be completely oblivious if the answer is out there, but I looked and have not been able to find a way to enable or disable the Reminder feature.

Trading S21 Ultra for S22 Ultra	After fiasco with a system update on my S21, I've decided to upgrade to S22, there's a sale going on Samsung, and they've offered $1000 for my phone, Getting a new phone for $299 seems like a good deal. Their care plan got more expensive, and after reading the fine print, I'm not sure if it even worth it. Also, decided to skip Samsung accessories and stick with the aftermarket. Will see how this new phone will perform. I'm actually happy with S21 Ultra, but S-pen bothers me, I came from Note 10.	N
S22 Ultra not unlocking after 60 days	"I spoke with a rep via chat and he confirmed my device is not unlocked and blocked feom other carriers UNTIL i pay off the device.

S22+ eSIM Help	"So today I bought a Galaxy S22+, unlocked. I am trying to get Verizon to activate the eSIM and they are saying they cannot. I tried CS Chat, iMessage chat, followed the guide on here and it keeps asking for an ICCID, which I cannot bypass on the website without one.
I have a physical SIM here, so if I were to enter that in the ICCID field on the website with the IMEI (eSIM), will it activate the eSIM by chance or does anyone know of a way to get this working?"	N
is s22 worth the upgrade？	"hi everyone， i am a JOD user that is currently using a pixel 6, despite inital good promise，the experience is far from ideal and I was thinking of jumping onto a new device. 
I already decided on One plus 9 pro， but they discontinue the device during the week of my visit， I was able to find the phone in store but they could not perform the upgrade despite multiple email and call.
I know one plus 10 pro is out， but i diske the new design and think it is absurd for them to charge 150 downpayment for not that much of a difference （worth camera，slightly better screen and a crappy new ship）.
That leaves samsung， i had s21 before and like the experience，but s22 has a reducecad battery with same crappy fast charing（ if you used an one plus you will know the difference） and power hungry chip.  For those with S22 how was your experience with it， is the battery sufficient.  I might consider s22 plus， but it is hard to justify the extra 2000 just for slight better battery.
Thank you"	N
Galaxy s22 ultra color choice?

the S22U battery is horrid.	This is my first Android phone coming from iPhone and in all other ways except battery I've been enjoying it. But goddamn dude I find myself having to charge it midway through the day EVERY DAY if I want it to last me until bed. I've done every optimization possible with Bixby. I have dark mode on when I can. Its like as soon as I unplug it and mess around with it for 15 minutes I lose 10% of battery. Sure super charging is nice but I have to take advantage of it only because my phone dies so quick lol. It really stinks because as I mentioned this is my first android and it leaves a really bad taste in my mouth that my old iPhone lasted what feels like double the time my new flagship android does..

45W or 25W charging for S22U	"Have had the phone for more than a month now, and have noticed battery life extend longer when charging using a generic 45W  charger instead of 25W charger. As in, I get 1+ day using 45W, vs. 18h+ using 25W.

Maybe quick press to start with default and long press to get options.Really, it'd be a great feature just to be able to turn a floating icon to quickly start and stop a recording. He k, it would be ok with me if the icon appeared in the vid.Maaybe just scale the video window a bit to leave room for it on one side. Or, make it a vertical bar that can float on the margin of the screen that is green for record and red for stop.You guys figure it out! Just git 'er done ... SON!	N

Just Traded in My N20U for Burgundy 512GB S22U	I've had my N20U for about a year and a half now. It is a great phone. I've had no problems with it, but as of yesterday I got half of it paid off with ATT which made me eligible for an upgrade. I decided to go with what i know which is a Samsung device. And the nice thing is that I'll actually be paying less for the S22U per month then i was for the N20U which had less storage. I receive the new phone tomorrow and I'm really excited for it, although I'm curbing a bit of that enthusiasm because although it's an upgrade, it's not a huge upgrade from the N20U. I still have to buy a case for the new phone, but until then I'll make due with trying to use one of the 15 cases I have for me N20U. Regarding cases has anyone had any luck using a N20U case with the S22U? I know they have slightly different dimensions but I'm assuming atleast one of my N20U cases should work. It only has to work until Monday when I can get an actual S22U case.	N

I'm not wanting to go to each contact and specify the same ring tone, I have a little over 220 contacts on my list and don't want to have to do every one of them, if that is the only way to achieve what I want, it isn't worth the time that would be involved; but it would be nice to hear a clip from the TV show, CSI...

Very Disappointed With Slower &amp; Slower Updates To Unlocked Phones!	Still cannot get the most recent update, which first dropped in India &amp; Asia 4-5 days ago. I dont expect to get it for another week despite being on the TMobile network in the US on an unlocked unit. I remember my N10+ seemed to get updates slowly and a little bit late and this was worse on my S20U, yet continues to take longer and longer on each new generation. I seriously don't think I'll get it before next week, at the earliest. I have sensitive client data on my phone. It's as secure as I can be but with Samsung taking their sweet time, it could end up costing me if this continues. Frankly, most of it is frustration that I keep checking every few hours and there's never anything there but it could be an issue for many people. Thoughta?	N

S21 for S22 or iPhone?	"I have had the S21 for about six months and the experience has been so so. I went from my favorite phone ever in the OnePlus 7 to the iPhone 12 Pro Max. It had antenna issues, Bluetooth issues and weird bugs. I was massively disappointed. 
I purchased the S21 and it has been fine until late. I stress fine as it didn't blow me away and the battery for a heavy user hasn't been great. The camera was also underwhelming. Regardless, I have wanted to move on since the antenna issues are constant with this phone as well (less than 1mgb downloads on 5 bar 5g), wifi Bluetooth issues and the system lagging even after multiple cache clears. 
So, I have come to a cross road. I can trade this in for the S22 Ultra and pay 148 I believe OR join my wife and try Apple once more with the 13 Pro or Pro Max.

New Galaxy S22 battery issues	"I've bought the Samsung Galaxy S22 two days ago.

Advice on choosing between Galaxy S22 and Galaxy S21 FE	"Hi guys,
My beloved Galaxy S9 has an issue with the charging port and Samsung are offering a £200 trade-in when buying an S22/S21 FE. Coupled with a student discount, I can get the following handsets close to my budget of £400 ($500):
* **Galaxy S22 - £408**; Exynos processor - 128GB//8GB RAM
* **Galaxy S21 FE - £392**; Snapdragon 888 processor - 256GB//8GB Ram
I would love to move for the S22 due to its compact size, however, I am concerned about reports of poor battery life. This has led me to consider the S21 FE as an alternative, despite the slightly lower spec.
I typically use my phone for around 2 - 4 hours a day; I don't play games, but mainly use it for Youtube, messaging, music streaming and browsing (mainly Reddit).
I feel like the S22 would be alright for a typical day, although my main concern is battery drain whilst I'm out (maps, music etc.) or lasting on a night out (when I need to catch an uber lol).
I would be very grateful for any advice, as the trade-in offer expires in a couple of days. Alternatively, I could repair my S9 charging port (£60) and stick it out until next year.
Thanks!"	N

My Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra Battery Life...	"I must say, this Adaptive Battery is really kicking in and doing a great job. At first my battery drain was ridiculous, but now I'm getting about 18 to 20 hours on a full charge and upwards of 6 or 7 hours screen on time per day regularly! Thank God.
When you factor in how much of the day is spent away from a place you'll be able to charge, this is absolutely perfect. Phone is zippy and smooth at all times too. Running the 8GB RAM, 128GB model. 
Anyone else had a great turnaround like this on Battery life?"	N
S20 to S22/S22+ Upgrade?	Hey everyone, I'm trying to trade in my S20 which is getting a worse battery life and some buggy keyboard issues. I would only have to pay 100 ish for S22 or S22+ (Price difference for these 2 don't matter to me). I've read terrible things about the S22 and S22+ battery life, should I just sit out this year?	N

Google Play App Install/Update Stuck - The Safe Mode Fix	Hi there,Thought I'd share my experience with Google Play Store App Install/Updates not working properly after getting my brand new S22+ this week.Been an Android User for the last 7 years (S7 Edge and Pixel 3a XL previously) and this is the FIRST TIME I've had intermittent issues with installing and updating apps.Tried my luck with the Google support FAQ here. But each of the steps did not work for me, though there are many people who share that clearing cache and data worked for them. I even went through 3 factory resets. Installing and updating apps on WiFi/mobile data just did not pan out. It's strange, there are times I can download a whole bunch of my old apps fine but after a few hours, the pending issue would return.I reached out to the Samsung Customer Service hotline here in the Philippines (#425299) and they were surprisingly able to help me out! Turned out to be a simple fix, but I guess your mileage may vary.Here are the steps recommended to me:Prerequisite: Ensure you are running on the latest Android security patch update. Mine is May 1, 2022 as of the time of writing.Reboot into Safe Mode. Every phone will be different but try bringing up the shutdown button options. Long-pressing the Power Off button for a few seconds will let you choose Safe Mode.After booting, restart your phone. It should reboot into the normal mode again.In Settings > Apps > Google Play Store > App Info, tap the three dots and "Uninstall updates". This should revert your Play Store to the factory version.Once after uninstalling, re-update Google Play to the latest version. In my case, the app did this automatically after launching.After, attempt to update/download your app.TL;DR - Boot into safe mode. Restart phone. Uninstall then reinstall Google Play Updates. Install app.Hard to say if it was just one or both of the steps, but really it worked for me.Good luck and I hope this helps at least one person out there.Cheers.	N
S22 ULTRA: Read receipts and groupchat naming capabilities	Hello everyone, I have recently obtained the Galaxy S22 Ultra. Coming from a S21 plus. I used to have a feature that was in the Samsung default messages. (Not the Google One, Not the Verizon one) you were about to create groupchats and name them. Also you were able to get ready receipts from other Samsung users. Yes very similar to Apple products. The issue is that now that I have finally finished setting up my new phone I don't have that capability anymore. Does any know what this can be or help me solve this issue. I have spoken with diffrrnt reps at Samsung many times and some have no idea what I'm talking about. This missing feature is limited from sending and receiving messages in the groupchat I've created. Is there anyone else out there that has experienced this issue and If so what did you do to fix it.	N

Blue dot ,delivery and seeing the person type gone?	On my S21 Ultra using the standard messages I was able to see the blue dot appear next to the contact. I was also able to see on certain contacts when a text was delivered and when they were typing back. I'd like this same thing for my S22 ultra. Thanks	N
Should I get s22 Ultra for personal photos and videos	First I ask no negative comments, I am an android person 100%. I have seen YouTube videos on how much better the IPhone 13 pro max is so much better than android in photos and videos. I currently have a s21ultra, I know or have read that the s22ultra is alot better. I was considering the iPhone ONLY for video and photo purposes. First is the iPhone that much better to go to the dark side for this purpose? I was criticized royal mentioning the iPhone, I would rather stay android. Then I have considered a 35mm digit camera system for this purpose. I'd appreciate any advice not condemning me for mentioning the iPhone. Thanks	N
Media files permissions?	"Hi, 
My problem is with pasting audiobook files from my win PC to my ultra22.  I plug the phone, pick transfer files, open the destination (Audiobooks) folder on the phone, try to paste the book and windows says ping!, and only pastes an empty folder. Tried different computer, same thing, BUT when I pasted in the downloads folder - success!, and theeeeen I just moved the book into the Audiobooks folder with no issue..... 
So, why it wouldn't allow me to paste straight into that folder? What has changed from the previous UI version? Because before the last update, I was able to that.... 
Are there any type of audio files that I can't just copy/paste on my phone?"	N

Rant: please stop with the my battery sucks post	First off no one wants to go to this subreddit and see nothing but people's screenshots of their battery life. Also does everyone have the memory of a goldfish? When the s8 came out the same stuff about poor battery life got posted on xda and the same thing with the S9 and then the S10 and then the S20. Guess what the phones learned and got software updates and battery life improved. Sorry rant over I just think unless your phone died half way through the day a few weeks after owning it then there is nothing to worry about no one even needs to be on their phone 7+ hrs a day anyway.

Bixby routine to protect battery not reversing after the routine ends.	Have a routine that runs every night between a set period to protect battery and turn fast charging off. However, upon the end of the routine the protect battery setting doesn't reverse and stays on until I manually turn it off. Is there a workaround for this? I don't want it on during the day	N

Help with astrophotography with my S22 ultra	"Hi guys,
I recently upgraded myself to S22 ultra. I tried to capture the night Sky using the RAW Camera app. I had the following in the options.  I used shutter speed as 30 sec , manual focus (0.7 as i can see the star in green) and iso as 800, 1600 and 3200. In all the different ISO, i can see the picture as White light. 
Can someone point out as what i am doing wrong here as i can see so many people posting some awesome pics of the sky here.
Cheers!!!!!"	N

For those want to fix buggy Samsung ?	I have two brothers bought s22 ultra, one of them used smart switch, sometimes complain of some bugs. I recommended to him not to do it with smart switch. While my second brother i did everything to him and his phone runs very smooth. I have the iphone 13 and i can till samsung on my second brother phone runs similar to the iphone and even faster. What i did to him first started the phone fresh delete all bloatwears apps I waited few minutes untill phone installed everything in background. After that cleared the partition cache you can see youtube videos about how to do it. Then i installed the major update the cleared partition cache. And in final I installed the apps he needs and updated all of the apps on the phone the cleared partition cache. You don’t have to go aggressive like me i just did that just as an experiment and fun, it worked really good. You can clean cache partition just once enough at the end of everything but if you want to make sure your Samsung run’s buttery smooth you can go my way.	N

Cracked UW lens	"So out of nowhere my S22U after overnight got an crack thru UW lens, what I find baffling, it had no drops, always secured in soft sleeve and never been put on hard surface ether (I take insane care of the phones, this is first ""Accident"" in past 8 years of using phones), so with all that confusion, is it possible that it was defected from manufacturer and it took just a bit of stress and failed ?
Also any idea how much the repair could be ?

Anyone having better battery life w/ wireless charging vs wired charging?	"So recently I bought a wireless charging stand for my s22u, and tried charging the phone to the max using both wireless and wired, somehow the battery life between 100-80 is significantly better using wireless charging compare to my 25w charger. I don't have an estimate but it feels twice as long.
That doesn't make any sense to me."	N

Are there non-glass screen protectors available that don't shrink?	"I ordered an IMBZBK TPU screen protector from Amazon for my S22 Ultra and after a month it began shrinking and riding up from the bottom, and then began to curl out from the top. The install went well, and it looked great for 3 weeks before the 1st signs of doom. Ive checked every possible TPU protector, and all have the same ""shrink"" reviews. 
I don't care if it's a thick blurry plastic protector, but does anyone know of one that doesn't totally blow? It's like they're all coming from the same Chinese factory. 
Also, I didn't want glass screen protector b/c every review says they either crack after a month of being in your pocket, or the fingerprint scanner won't work."	N
