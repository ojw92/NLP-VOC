Don’t mean to be negative but….	I anticipate a lot of S21 ultra owner not being impressed, in fact I think ppl might just stick with their S21 ultra. Yea the S22 ultra is new but it feels slower than it’s predecessor. It’s not as smooth (noticeable), it’s not as fast and the new SoC is not impressive AT ALL.	R
Issues with At&t and Google Messages	"So, here's my issue.... My wife and I both got new S22U's on At&t and since GMessages is default now we wanted to give it a try. We both loved Samsung Messages in the past so we were a little hesitant, but nonetheless we were gonna try it out. Both phones connected to chat features with no issues, but no chats were created, only SMS/MMS, even between us, but I chocked it up to a server side issue and would probably work itself out.  
But after using GM yesterday & last night, my wife decided she didn't like GM (she has caterogories on SM and said she couldn't live without them, lol) so I switched her over to SM, connected to advanced messaging and now she has read/delivered receipts when she texts me (I'm still on GM) but I'm showing SMS to her, weird.  
My question is, is anyone else having issues with GM saying they are connected to chat, but not actually able to create RCS chats?"	R
Small ding on camera ring. Should I keep or return?	"Order the Green 512 GB Ultra through T-Mobile.  Phone came out of the box with a small ding on one of the camera rings.  Should I keep it or return it?  Do they keep some in stock for returns/exchanges or would I have to wait till March to get a replacement due to back orders?  And if so, do I get till the replacement comes in to send in the trade-in?

Laggy Image Viewer in some Apps	"I noticed that some times in apps where u can swipe between a couple of images like on Reddit, WhatsApp, etc. its starts ""lagging"". Not sure if the LTPO is confused and reduces refreshrate or something else. Just had it on WhatsApp, left the image viewer and opend an image again and it was back to normal. 
Guess could be fixed in a day 1 patch but im currious if anyone else noticed that?"	R
Rcs texting... Who's got the fix?	Got the s22 ultra today. Switch over everything this evening. "Setting up... Trying to verify your number" has been on for hours at this time... Do I just keep waiting??	R
Defective front camera		R
Camera fail	Anyone else getting this on their S22 ultra?	R
Strong green tint on S22 Ultra Screen?	Does anyone else notice a strong green tint on their S22 Ultra/other screen? Just got mine yesterday and if I tilt the phone back colors appear normal, but parallel with my face (normal hold position) or forward at all and everything turns green. Stronger on the bottom half than the top. I've heard of this on AMOLED screens before, but did not have this issue at all on my Note 20 Ultra.	R
Delayed Gmail notifications?	"I have experienced Delayed Gmail notifications? On my last two Samsung phones including my current note 20 ultras gmail notifications are delayed. Even the pixel seems to do it. Been researching for years with no real work to get that fixed. It has something to do with its Doze feature. Adjusting it in the battery settings does nothing for it.  
Has anyone seen delayed Gmail notifications on the S22 ultra?"	R
Samsung Dex not connecting to pc anybody else having this problem?	I am trying to connect Samsung Dex wireless from phone to pc and it keeps saying couldn't connect to pc try again and yes i do have samsung dex downloaded onto my pc and wifi is turned on. It works just fine with my s10 plus.	R

45W adapter not super fast charging s22 ultra	Hi! I got an aukey adapter and powerbank both support PD up to 63 walts however my S22 ultra is not charging at 18w speed. Does anyone knows why? thanks!	R
S22 Ultra - Laggy Camera in low light	Is anyone else experiencing camera lag in low light? I'm coming from a Pixel 6 which is nice and smooth in the same lighting.	R
S22 Ultra - Anyone having trouble with hidden nav bar gestures?	I like to use navigation bar with the gestures, hidden.. and I'm noticing that I'm having to swipe my finger up more than once every time to get the phone to recognize the gesture. Is anyone else having this same issue?	R
Bitwarden not autofilling on my S22 Ultra	My S22 Ultra arrived today and I'm setting it up. I use Bitwarden and have turned on the auto-fill settings in the Bitwarden app, but it will not auto fill or pop up anything to let me select a vault item to autofill, I have to manually switch to the app, is there any additional setting I need to turn on or adjust to get the autofill to work?	R
Google assistant voice command not working for anyone else?	I have an s22 ultra. I've been trying to set up google assistant for a while now and no troubleshooting advice I've found online has worked. When I say hey google, I get the green microphone indicator in the top right as if it's listening, but assistant doesn't open. Google is my default assistant in the settings, too. I can manually open the assistant if I click on it without issue. I've retrained the voice model, I've uninstalled + reinstalled assistant, restarted my phone. I'd like to not have to factory reset it already if there's another way. Anyone have any advice?	R
Android Auto screen blurry on Ford	Has anyone else noticed Android Auto screen looks Terrible? It looks like a 480P image. Apple Carplay looks fine but as soon as I switch over to Android auto the whole UI is low res. Im on a 2020 Ford.	R
Fingerprint reader garbage with tempered glass screen protector? Base S22	"Had an S21, no screen protector, and fingerprint reader was awesome.
Received S22 today, immediately put on LK tempered glass screen protector, and the fingerprint reader is terrible.  Was difficult to even add my fingerprints.
Should I just trash the tempered glass?
Anybody finding that the screen protector works well even with tempered glass?"	R
Dust inside camera lense	Yeah so I think there is a decent sized peace of white dust or something under my camera lense glass on the bottom. Notice it when I went to put on my camera protector. Ugh time to wait mad long time for a replacement.	R
Question about screen refresh rate.	When I'm on discord and just on a dm page not interacting with the screen, when they send me a message the scroll up animation after a new message looks a bit laggy. I remember reading something about the refresh rate changing or something like that, would this be a case of that?	R
Why isn't Hotspot turning on?	S22 unlocked on T mo. I'm clicking the hotspot slider, I get haptic vibrate but the slider won't turn on.	R
Shutter lag issue	"i got my s22 yesterday. i love it except for the blurry photos it takes of my kid. Looks like samsung did not fix that shutter lag after all.
any one experience the same thing? I am considering returning the phone and stick with my pixel 5 or get an iphone"	R
WhatsApp backup not restoring on my S22	I just got a Galaxy S22 and downloaded WhatsApp and restoring a backup from Google Drive and I keep getting a message saying unable to restore backup, check the phone's connection. But the connection was fine and I tried it multiple times and same thing. My previous phone was a Galaxy Note 8. What is the problem?	R
Facebook messenger?	I'm not getting notifications on my Facebook messenger. I have to actually open the app and then floods of messages come through. I'm not on do not disturb, and I even turned off the background sleeping apps. I added it to the never put to sleep list too and still its not coming through. Any suggestions?	R
S22 Ultra Android Auto not working wired	I have a Note 20 I am planning on trading in on the S22 Ultra I got. Like everyone a fee things aren't working. I noticed tonight that Android Auto does not come on the car screen display on my Chevy Bolt. Is anyone else having this issue. Is it planned to be fixed? My car doesn't have built in navigation so I use either maps or waze. This could be the deal breaker for me. If I can't get it resolved.	R
Charging issue s22 Ultra	Brand new s22 Ultra has an issue super fast charging. It works fine, but will stop charging whenever I get a notification. Then it will start again. It's not really an issue but it's really obnoxious. It's already been ran through IQC, and passes everything fine. Wondering if any others have had this issue.	R
Google Messages web browser issue??	Occasionally I have been having issue where web page says can't connect and then when open messages on phone, no messages show. At that point I have to force stop the messages app and clear cache then app opens fine and messages show and browser works. Never happened on S21. Some campatibility issue??	R
Anyone having issues with snapchat map?	Always worked perfect with my s20 ultra. But it doesn't load anything on my s22 ultra. Anyone having the same issue?	R
S22 Ultra ear speaker VERY TINNY sounding on phone calls!	"Compared to my S20+ on phone calls, the ear speaker in the new Ultra sounds extremely tinny, cheap and has absolutely no bottom-end whatsoever. Not saying it should sound like a subwoofer but this is VERY disappointing. Yes, I tried playing with the equalizer categories, doing the sound tests, checked/unchecked Dolby Atmos. I tried everything...unless there's 1 or 2 equalizer bars that are just for bottom end that I'm not familiar with. 
Anyone else disappointed with the ear speaker? Any suggestions?
Thanks"	R
Unable to connect to Wi-Fi Calling	"I spent all day yesterday bouncing back and forth between Samsung and Verizon trying to get Wi-Fi calling to connect. I'm on a Verizon Business plan and transferred my Sim card from my Verizon NOTE2O+ to new unlocked 22ULTRA. The Wi-Fi calling toggle button won't stay on and a pop up msg says, ""Unable to activate wifi calling at this time. Please try again later."" Verizon synced my phone/number 3 times yesterday and still no go. By the time I got back to Samsung 10 hrs later for the 3rd time there was a 90minute wait time for a call back and I never got a call. I live and work from home in a rural area with horrible cellular reception and had 1 call drop 5 times yesterday so no Wi-Fi calling is a deal breaker. I think I may have a defective phone.  
If anyone has any suggestions I'd appreciate your input."	R
Buyers Remorse?	"I’m gonna be that guy.. starting to wonder if I made the right decision and if this phone goes back. 
Mine finally arrived yesterday - and I’ve been looking forward to it for days. Literally waiting.  
Coming from an iPhone 13 Pro but as a former Samsung lover and frustrated iPhone owner.  
And it’s the simple things that are just getting to me - Android related more than Samsung: 
- I plugged my phone into my car this morning and fired up Android Auto.. couldn’t find TuneIn Radio to stream a radio station I listen to ALL the time (which I normally just fire up by hitting the ‘favorites’ tab on Apple CarPlay). Told Google Assistant to stream it and it said it was - but then nothing. Struggling to find a workaround here (I used an app called Global Player normally if TuneIn fails as it’s a Global station - but neither of them are on AA). Tried disconnecting my phone from CarPlay and just talking to GA normally, but same issue.  
- Told my phone to make a WhatsApp audio call and was astounded that this STILL isn’t a thing! I use WhatsApp audio ALL the time. I have at least managed to get around this with Bixby, but it’s a bit of a crude solution. How can WhatsApp voice calls not be supported on Android but they are on iPhone which is way more closed down!? 
The phone itself is beautiful - I got the white and it knocks spots off my iPhone in terms of design which just feels stale. But I’m definitely starting to feel a little ‘meh’ about it. Hoping that wears off.. Will give it a date or two."	R
Screen hz drops to 60 when typing on the keyboard	I know there are ways to force 120 buy is there any way to force 120hz only when using the keyboard. It is noticeable because I swipe a lot to go home when my keyboard is opened and the hz stays at 60	R
Android Auto S22U	This morning I plugged my phone into my 2022 Honda and can't even get android auto to initiate. My car says no android auto device is connected. Anyone else experiencing this?	R
Wild rift s22 ultra	Anyone else able to get the 90 or 120 fps options to work? Mine in-game says my device isn't supported	R
Galaxy S22 (Snapdragon) Moderate Usage: Bluetooth headset listening to podcasts, no sim, most of the time in the same room as the wifi. Only 3h 20m SOT. Only signed into Instagram and didn't even use, but that consumed 6.4% battery somehow.		R
Playback controls wrong or absent		R
S22 Ultra - Corner of screen warped	"My chat session below. I have had nothing but issues communicating with support and trying to fix issues they created during the whole pre-order process.
ME: S22 Ultra has a part of the screen under the   glass that is warped

*** Pamulapati Siri Harika joined the chat ***

Pamulapati Siri Harika: Thank you for contacting Samsung! My name is   Siri. I will be assisting you
(01:04:15)
ME: Hello Siri
(01:06:31)
Pamulapati Siri Harika: One minute please.
(01:08:41)
Pamulapati Siri Harika: Please elaborate your concern for better   understanding

(01:09:30)
ME: When looked at in light, this part of the   screen underneath the glass appears to be warped or something
(01:11:00)
ME: I have more screenshots but they all look   pretty much the same
(01:11:01)
Pamulapati Siri Harika: Is there any damage with the order ?
(01:11:40)
ME: The part that I sent you looks damaged but I   am not sure if that's normal
(01:13:15)
Pamulapati Siri Harika: If there is any damages, you can just return   the product.
(01:13:49)
ME: How does that process work?
(01:14:42)
Pamulapati Siri Harika: If you would return and then re order.
(01:15:26)
ME: That's crazy, would you guys expedite a new   order out? I would be without a phone
(01:17:06)
Pamulapati Siri Harika: Let me explain you something here.
(01:18:50)
Pamulapati Siri Harika: If the order is fine, then there is no need   of the return.
(01:20:09)
ME: You are confusing me, I reached out about   the screen being warped on the bottom right frame. You asked if there was any   damage with the order. I replied with what I sent you and asked if that's   normal.
(01:20:47)
ME: If that is indeed considered damage and not   normal then I would like to have a new phone that isn't damaged
(01:21:11)
Pamulapati Siri Harika: If the product was wrapped then it is just   for the security of the product.
(01:22:12)
ME: I am talking about the picture I sent you earlier
(01:23:06)
Pamulapati Siri Harika: One minute please.
(01:23:10)
ME: No problem
(01:24:58)
Pamulapati Siri Harika: I am having a word with my team.
(01:25:26)
ME: No problem, thanks
(01:27:31)
Pamulapati Siri Harika: Thank you for waiting.
(01:27:44)
Pamulapati Siri Harika: It is just wrapping, there is no issues with   the phone.
(01:29:15)
ME: I do believe there is some confusion here, I   am not sure what you mean by wrapping but this is underneat the glass and   where the OLED board connects to the frame of the phone
(01:33:11)
Pamulapati Siri Harika: It is just to avoid any cracks on the   screen,
(01:33:47)
ME: I am not talking about the packaging that   came in the box, this is underneath the corning gorilla glass, the display   itself. This warping of the display is normal?
(01:35:30)
Pamulapati Siri Harika: Yes, exactly.
(01:36:39)
ME: Ok, well I have never had a screen that has   had this. I will document this chat for future reference should the screen   have any issues related to this. I work with electronics all the time and I   do believe that this is not normal but if you say it's fine then I guess I   will try not to let it bother me.
(01:38:52)
Pamulapati Siri Harika: Sure, please be rest asured.
(01:40:25)
Pamulapati Siri Harika: Have we covered everything that you wanted   to discuss today?

(01:41:23) 
***  has commented: Underneath my S22 Ultra's   Corning Gorilla Glass, where the actual display is. There is a bit of the   screen that is warped and reflects light oddly but according to your customer   support, this is normal and this ""wrapping"" is part of the product.   Not sure if there is a bad language barrier but I will definitely be   documenting this in case anything happens. ***

S22 Ultra having issues connecting to T-Mobile Network	FYI: I spent 2 days with a phone that couldn't connect to T-Mobile, kept getting no sim card errors. This is happening to alot of people, and the work around they are using is connecting to T-Mobile via eSIM. If you have this issue, request this work around.	R

New S22 ultra, recent Sprint-to-TMO, having trouble with connectivity + how to reset provisions on T-mobile?	"Is resetting provisions thing that exists with T-Mobile? There was a dialer code on my old phone with the old Sprint SIM (switched to a T-mo SIM a few months back) where I could reset the signal provisions, effectively reactivating the mobile network connections entirely.
I upgraded to an unlocked S22 ultra mostly to solve some connectivity issues I was having (especially at home) and to take advantage of the 5g as my Note 10+ didn't have that capability.
When I'm in my home (in a major population center), especially in my room, SignalCheck shows me as not having any connection at all and I'll get the ""no signal"" no smoking style sign. But it shifts around a lot. But even with some ""better"" LTE bands getting picked up (t-mobile 66 is OK it seems, maybe 71), if they do get picked up, I don't seem to be getting great speeds and stable connection. 
I did disable this phone from connecting to Sprint 26 as that was causing me major problems on my old phone with call drops, mms, etc. I've used a dialer code and also Samsung Band Selector Tool in the past. 
Sometimes it says 5G though I gather it has to show 5GUC for it truly be, though I haven't seen it yet. I am in a 5G area. When it shows 5G for a few seconds, I run a test and it's negligible and 10 down, 20 down etc. 
On average, when off wifi, I'm getting 5-10 down. Maybe my house or area sucks, but as I said, I should be in an area and I shouldn't be struggling. 
What would you guys suggest? Is this a common complaint at the moment, with this new phone and such? Definitely frustrating given the quality of this brand new phone and the upgrading from Sprint network to T-Mobile. The bad part is that the weak/non-existent connection seems to be draining the battery heavily which is sad for a brand new phone with a 5000mah. 
Thanks in advance."	R
Is anyone else missing the SmartThings Audio Output persistent notification?	"Used to be right where the arrow is pointing. 
I added a pic I found via Google of the menu when expanded."	R
diagnostics code?	When I dial the USSD code *#0*# in my unlocked US S22 Ultra, it starts by properly saying "USSD code running...", but then says "Unable to process this request". Do others find the same thing? Is there a different code to use, or a way to make the standard code work?	R
S22 Ultra Battery Disappointment	"Anyone else disappointed with their battery life from their S22 Ultra? 
Coming from the smaller iPhone 13 Pro, I am getting about half the battery life with moderate usage. 
I love Android over IOS as an operating system but it's embarrassing a device with a 3095 mah vs 5000 mah is way better. 
I know there are ""tweaks"" I can do to extend battery life but with a brand new flagship that shouldn't be necessary.."	R
Wear Os	I have the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 and I can't get the Wear Os to connect! Can someone please help me?	R
A few days in with my new S22 Ultra and already having some strange issues	"Took ownership of my 512GB Ultra on the 22nd. Already noticed a couple of annoying things with it. Hope to get some insight here, and if nothing else maybe it'll all be fixed with updates. 
* Issue 1: Problems booting into the boot menu. Holding power + volume key, it'll boot into the boot menu as normal. The second I take my finger off either key (tested and doesn't matter which) it will IMMEDIATELY go black and reboot normally. I've tried this multiple times and regardless every single time the second I release the keys it will go black and reboot normally. I cannot select any options from the boot menu and can only see it if I keep both keys pressed. I have owned Galaxy S series since the 4 and just came from the 20 Ultra so I am aware of how this works. 
* Issue 2: Screen going black and turning back on to the lock screen. Doesn't matter what app or what I'm doing, and its totally random. I'll be doing whatever and the screen randomly turns off, then it turns back on onto the lock screen. I'll unlock it and it will be back to normal until it decides to do it again. 
* Issue 3: Snapchat. I'm not sure if its the phone or snap or what, but it was totally fine on my S20 Ultra also running Android 12 with the newest One UI. Snap map doesn't work, like, at all. None of my friends show up and the little ""hotspot"" circles around the world (no idea what they are called) just show as huge black circles on the world map. The other issue is zooming. I cannot slightly zoom in or out. The second I go to zoom even slightly it zooms all the way in and it cannot be controlled. 
Has anyone else had any of these issues? How do I go about fixing it? I'm close to just factory resetting. I have already done the ""Reset all settings"" option and it did not fix any of the problems."	R
Strange pop-up on new S22 Ultra	I've been getting this strange pop-up from Google asking for diagnostic data several times a day on my new S22 Ultra (see picture). I called Google and they didn't know. I have pop-ups turned off in Google. I deleted and reset up my Google Account and even factory reset the phone. The pop-up is showing up randomly. I'm hoping someone has seen this before on perhaps an S21 or other Android phone. When I set up the phone, I opted out of sending any diagnostic data to Google. Any ideas would be appreciated.	R
S Pen Disconnected Notification	"I vaguely recall a YouTuber (I've watched so many videos recently or I'd try and trace this back...) saying you can set your S22U to notify you when you've left your s pen behind and walked away OR to have it notify you as soon as you lock your screen (which was demonstrated).  
How do I set it for the later (notify as soon as you lock the screen without your s pen connected)? 
My mom loses her spen fairly often, I'd love to figure that out to set it up when hers arrives tomorrow. The only setting I've seen is in the s pen settings, ""warn if s pen is left behind,"" and it doesn't give me any sub menu/additional options."	R
Anyone know why my S22 default messaging app does this? My S10 never did it. Thanks		R
Is the wifi antenna weaker on S22U?	It seems my connection to the 5GHz network is bad in some areas of the house where I previously did not have issues with S21.	R
S22 Ultra Snapchat Bugs - Anybody Else?		R
Instagram Stories freeze using S22	My wife and I recently upgraded from our Samsung S20 phones to the new Samsung S22. We both noticed that Instagram Stories will play for a bit and then freeze with the buffer spinner in the top right. We've been through all the trouble shooting steps and still no go. When we let the same IG Stories play side by side on our S20's, the S20 continues playing the videos without freezing, even while the S22 is frozen again. I see a subreddit for the S21 describing this issue saying software version 12 resolves the issue. Unfortunately we are on s/w version 12 and still the issue persists. This seems to be a known issue? Anyone else seeing this? Any solutions I'm missing?	R
Screen stays off &amp; phone locked when receiving call with DND on	"Does anyone else have this problem?
I enable DND at night but allow all calls through. When I receive a call the phone rings but the screen stays off and it also remains locked. I have to fumble with it to turn it on and unlock before I can answer the call. Surely this is not intended behavior?
Without DND on the call wakes the screen and I can immediately answer.

S22 Disappointing Performance.		R
Fingerprint Scanner Issues	"I tried looking in the sub, very sorry if it's been posted before! 
Switched from an S9+ to the S22+, wife has the S22 and we're having crazy issues with this stupid fingerprint scanner. 
No matter what I do I keep getting error messages and eventually it'll force me to use a pin. Anyone having the same experience? The scanner says press harder/cover the entire sensor and no matter how I move my finger around, it's just not happy.
Loved the scanner on the back of the S9+, no idea why they thought it's better in a spot you can't see unless you turn the screen on anyways. Very frustrated and any help would be appreciated!
E: Thanks for the responses. I don't have any screen protectors and I think I'll be staying away from them anyways. 
I re enrolled my fingers, added multiple fingerprints of my thumb and so far am having more way luck. Will see how that works over the next couple of days!"	R
USB C is a freaking mess. 45 W charger only does Super Fast Charging from the included cable.	"Got the 45 W charger.
Apparently we have Super Fast Charging and Super Fast Charging 2.0. This is on top of the standard Cable Charging and Fast Charging. 
But Super fast Charging 2.0 only works with the bundled cable. 
This following is expected. 
[[45 W Charger + In box cable ](https://i.imgur.com/h2s0MUm.jpg)
The following is not 
[45 W Charger + Other USB c to usb cable](https://i.imgur.com/WRSHfSu.jpg)
But if you use any other cable you get Super Fast Charging, not Super Fast Charging 2.0. 
Mind you, the other cable does 90 W charging to my MacBook pro just fine.
How is anyone supposed to know all these details when all the cables look similar.
Pretty messed up!"	R
S22 Ultra RCS issues... Connected but not working	"I got my s22 ultra and was super happy to see the messages app from Google was baked in and the default texting app! Most of who I text have android and use the advanced chat features as well. So I set it up and it worked for a day or so....
Now it's completely broken, but it still says I'm connected and the features are enabled, but when my friends try to message me it says ""waiting until (my name) is online"". I can send messages but only MMS, so no read receipts, high quality pictures etc. 
I tried clearing my carrier services app and messages app, but that didn't work. I message T-Mobile and try to talk to their reps but none of them know what RCS is and it goes nowhere.
I went to [this link provided by Google ](https://messages.google.com/disable-chat) and tried this, as I read some people were having issues with RCS due to TMobile forcing their own backend for RCS features instead of using Google's but this didn't fix it either.
I did a sim swap which fixed it for about 45 minutes then it broke again. I'm out of options as im not sure I want to risk a factor restore and not have it fix the issue. 
The RCS worked flawlessly on Verizon and this issue has me very close to switching back, but I wanted to post here and see if anyone had ideas before I call it quits."	R
S22 Ultra randomly locking	I will be using my phone, but then it'll regularly just turn off and lock leaving me to have to unlock it again. Anyone else having this issue?	R
S22U: Icons moving despite home screen being locked?	"Anyone else having an issue with the home screen lock not actually locking icon placement?
Specifically, this is happening to my bottom row of icons on the home screen that stay as you swipe through your different home screen pages. At least a couple times a day they will swap order randomly. It doesn't swap out the apps out or anything that drastic, but will change the order those 5 icons are in order at will. *Every single time* this happens I go into the settings and ""Lock Home screen layout"" is toggled on. 
It's driving me effing bananas. I switched to the 22U because I got sick of the Pixel 6 Pro bugs, and this is such a dumb issue to encounter because it effects basic functionality and muscle memory when using a touchscreen device.

Screen does not turn on when receiving a phone call	I feel silly asking this because I am sure it is something simple that I am missing. For many years, I constantly have had Do Not Disturb enabled. I had it with the Note 10+ , the Note 20 Ultra, Pixel 6 Pro and now S22 Ultra. I always allow ALL calls to go through. It has always worked before but now everytime someone calls, the screen does not light up and even when I unlock the phone, I still have to swipe down from notifications to see whose phone call it is. I checked all the settings and included every single "call" and "phone" related items to the exclusion list (something I've never had to do before). The phone DOES turn on if Do Not Disturb is off but alas, does not when it is enabled. Is anyone having the same problem or can anyone offer some tips? Thanks for your help in advance.	R
Weird input delay	"I've had the SM-908U 12 GB/256 GB (Snapdragon) for a week and I'm getting this slight delay where when switching rapidly between apps, the interface won't accept a touch for a beat or two. I'm coming from the S21 Ultra, Note 20 ultra, S20 Ultra, etc down the line and I've never experienced this little delay. 
The best way I can describe it is like the UI loads first then the touch interface is a step behind it. It's not a huge difference, but if you're used to multi-tasking quickly it's very noticeable. Basically if I'm typing a word it will miss the first letter but pick up the next one right after so it's a very brief delay. 
I'm using Swiftkey keyboard and Nova Launcher (old habits) @ WQHD+ resolution with Adaptive motion smoothness so maybe that has something to do with it. Otherwise the phone is stock with no Developer Options enabled. Wondering if anyone else has noticed this with a different setup or is there a setting I can tweak to make it better. 
Thanks"	R

I'm returning my S22 Ultra due to battery issues	"Hey! Just posting here in case you have similar experience. Pre-ordered S22 Ultra and got it earlier than I expected. It's been almost 10 days now. Since I got the phone I'm very disappointed with the SOT and battery performance. I've upgraded from S9+. I haven't seen anything above 4.5 hours SOT so far. I can understand that at the beginning there are many things being uploaded/updated but they should have gotten better so far. My general usage is mostly around social media and watching videos. You can check the link for reference.

Do you think that this would get better? I don't think it will improve to 6-7 hours in time. 
What do you think?"	R
Galaxy s22 ultra camera pics of tvs	Whenever I take a picture of a monitor or TV, its super bright and can't see anything on screen. Otherwise this camera is heads and shoulders better then my old s10+ Anyone experience this?	R

Galaxy S22+ occasionally feels laggy/unsmooth animation?	"I've been using S22+ (Snapdragon) for a few days now and feel like the system can be a little laggy at times. The scenarios include opening apps (especially not recently used apps), settings menu, return to home screen... It is smooth and snappy for the most part but occasionally it would lag 0.x second before the new screen pops up. For comparison I also have a Pixel 6 Pro and set both animation scale to 0.5x. The animation is always smooth and responsive in the Pixel.
I guess what bothers me the most is that responsiveness on the S22+ is inconsistent and makes me worry it would deteriorate in the long run. I didn't notice any lag when setting animation scale to 1.0x in the S22+ so it feels like sometimes the system has a processing delay
Is anyone feeling the same?"	R
Stutters for the first 5 seconds of every video	"I have the S22 Snapdragon, and the first 5 seconds of any video I recorded are stuttery. Last time I've seen this was when I had the S7, and 4k recording wasn't fully figured out yet.
I record 4k30, HDR10+, with video stabilization on. With the same settings, my S20 had no issues...
Do you guys see this too?"	R

Seems like it's showing me Google assistant reminders about 15 hours ahead of time or at least some measure of time ahead of when they're supposed to pop up.
Doesn't make sense. Makes me fear they won't pop up when I actually want them to.

s22U , t-mobile wifi calling is laggy and unusable	"Hi,
Using my s22U for the 5th day now, looks like wifi calling is very laggy. When I call someone the voice of the other side is suddenly slowing down and break up badly, then comes back after 10-15sec and break up again. Problem goes away once I disable wifi calling. This is a reproducible issue 100% of the time. Im using the same access point, wifi settings, etc. as with the s20U that I'm returning and the s20U works great with wifi calling.
Does anyone else suffer from wifi calling issues? If so, did you find any solution?"	R
S22 Ultra Searching For Service Emergency Use Only Issue ?	" Wondering if this is a known issue?
I just got a US Samsung factory direct unlocked SM-S908U1 a few days ago running on a Xfinty Mobile Sim and a T-Mobile eSIM the phone keeps loosing service mostly on the Xfinty sim and saying **Searching For Service Emergency Use Only** wondering is this a know issue related to the S22 ?

S22 ultra messages being weird.	"So I've used Google messages for 2 years now, same with my wife, and we've never had a problem.
We both got 22U and our messages will be delayed/undelivered until the other person is ""connected"" to the chat service. So legit the only way to accomplish this is turning the phone off and on or airplane mode.
Never had this issue before. So annoying because we'll not get messages HOURS apart. Anyone else experiencing? Or have a fix? We've gone through all basic trouble shooting.
I'm assuming it's not a sim issue but a messages glitch?
Weird that it happens with both of our phones though I figured it might be a common thing"	R

I can't get my external ssd storage to work on the s22 ultra, but it works on the note 8. Anyone know a fix?	I used a PCIE 4.0 1tb NVME SSD in a external NVME enclosure, which worked perfectly fine on the Note 8. It says it's not supported on my S22u. I tried a PCIE 3.0 500mb Samsung branded NVME in an external NVME SSD, and it kind of works. Kind of because it'll disconnect when transferring videos, but photos seem to transfer fine. I can get it the external NVME with the Samsung SSD to kind of work about 50% of the time. Is anyone else experiencing the same problem, and does anyone know a solution?	R
I cant post stories on my IG with my new S22+	I recently got my new S22+ and I'm happy with my new phone. I tried posting a couple of stories yesterday on IG, and when I clicked "post" the picture was "loaded," but then it didn't post anything. I tried a couple of more times and again nothing. I updated my IG and then uninstalled/reinstalled and again nothing. I can post pictures, but just not any stories. I am not sure if it's a phone issue or an IG one. Any suggestion? Thanks	R
No Support For .wma Files?	"I was surprised that my new S22 Ultra didn't support the sound format of .wma files. I have several notifications sounds in that format, which worked fine on my Note 20U. I decided to converted the .wma to .mp3 on my PC. Thought Android & Microsoft were getting along.  
I'll have to test on my Husband's s22 Ultra when he comes home. 
There's probably not much demand for .wma support. It's obviously not that important, just a curiosity thing... "	R
S22U Screen occasionally glitches/blacks out?	"So I've been using the ultra for about 2 weeks now, and apart from the weird gaming settings (where I can't enable high res settings) the screen occasionally blacks out or glitches out with some green on the screen.

Snapdragon S22 Ultra Bugs?	"Just curious but has anyone found any bugs on the s22 ultra? I have a few that have been bothering me.
1) Swipe gesture from the bottom of the screen doesn't always work, sometimes I have to swipe 3-5 times for it to get what I was doing. This never happened on my s21 ultra.
2) Sometimes the power button doesn't turn the screen on, this seems to happen way more with the phone plugged in. Ironically if I just touch the fingerprint scanner it always works, but I guess I have an old habit of still pressing the power button as well and it's odd that the phone doesn't respond to this.
Has anyone else noticed these issues? I'm guessing they're bugs rather than hardware issues."	R
Keyboard often goes away after pushing one key, any suggestions?	"It'll be within any app where the keyboard pops up, I'll push a key, or might get two in time if I'm quick, and it just disappears.

Auto brightness is not great	"Coming from the note20u ultra I kept the phone on auto brightness and thought it did a decent job. 
The problem I have is how low the brightness goes in dark environment. It's so dim the screen is really hard to see. 
I ended up installing velis Auto brightness and while it's a little complex at first it does the trick. I set a limit based on amount of lightning on how bright I want the screen  
Now this isn't a set and forget it. You need to measure brightness detected by the app and adjust the brightness levels. Take a few days of going in different environments but you can get it the way you want."	R

S22 Ultra Bluetooth audio quality issue	"I know it was a rough lunch for the S22 Ultra. And most of the issues don't really effect me enough for all the benefits this phone provides. 
Except, the Bluetooth audio is so lifeless. Doesn't matter if it's my car or my headset. The bass Sometimes washes everything out, sometimes the highs are ear piercing and it just feels like there is no depth to the audio at all. I wasn't really expecting this to be an issue, but I use my phone to listen to music at least 5-8hrs a day at work, so it's a bit of a deal breaker.

How easily lightly moving objects get blurred is an embarrassment. How do I get around this? S22U	"Dumped my fold 3 because I got tired of replacing it.

Typing is frustrating on S22U	"I'm not having the same ""hanging"" issues that others are having but the phone is very frustrating to type on. It's as if it's not keeping up with my typing speed. It has a very noticeable lag in response to typing. Sometimes the lag is so bad I have to stop typing in order for the input to catch up. Something I never experienced with any other Samsung phone I've owned at least as long as I can remember. Coming from the Note 20U this is a major downgrade in performance. It's quite frankly impossible to use. I have done what everyone on the forum has recommended and still the lag persists. Waiting for the phone to ""stabilize"" has not made a difference.  
My return window closes shortly so I'm wondering if the opinion here is most believe an update will be provided to fix the lag issue? 
Or is this is as good as it gets and is more of a hardware issue (apparently the new chip is substandard)."	R

However, they _only_ work if I disable one at a time.
With both SIMs inserted, I only get 4G data out of the physical SIM and no data at all from the eSIM. If I set the eSIM as my primary SIM, it acts like I have no data at all.

First Impressions- S21 Ultra (first day)	Coming from an s21 ultra this phone gets really hot. I'm not sure why. It gets hot while it's charging and also during regular use. The UI seems a lot more buggy than on the s21 ultra as well and less smooth. The battery also dies faster. I know the phone has to analyze my usage pattern &amp; it takes a few days but still annoying. I also know that Samsung will push an update to help with all of this (hopefully). But it's annoying that a $1400 phone has all of these issues out of the box. I've had androids most of my life and I feel like this would never happen with an iphone.

Spotty Signal	Anyone else experiencing signal drops and phone calls cutting in and out? Unlocked on Verizon (all phones have been). While I'm out driving, I notice a lot of times people will tell me I'm breaking up and many times when going to call someone I look at the bars and it's just a no signal icon. I have wifi calling enabled and even at home my calls are spotty and break up. I do have WiFi6E and was wondering if that's possibly causing problems at home when on wifi as that is very short range. Sometimes I'll try and call someone and it ends call as soon as I push the call button. If I restart phone it works fine. I notice when I have the no signal icon while out driving it doesn't find signal until I restart phone. Had amazing signal the first week or so but since it's just gotten worse and worse. Thoughts?

the last 5% of battery dies crazy quick.	Do you guys notice that once that phone hits 4 percent you only got a few minutes left with it and once it hits 2 percent that sucker is about to go black screen any second.

I honestly wish I could set it up to lie and just say 2 percent when it still has 5 percent so my brain would say hey you need this on a charger asap. Because know I'm like o snap I gotta charge this soon and by the time I'm picking up my charger it shuts off. 5% feels more like .05%	R
Galaxy S22 base model speakers failed after a week	"Today my ear speaker and loud speaker on the base model S22 started crackling out of nowhere. I restarted the phone but same thing.
All sounds, phone calls with and without speaker mode, notification sounds, Spotify, YouTube, everything. Sound is unusable.
My Bluetooth ear buds still sound normal playing from phone. 
No drops, no water or moisture, nothing. 
I did a Google search and found a thread on a forum of someone with the S22 ultra having the same issue. Someone in the comments said they had it too and pressing firmly on the screen made it sound normal. So I tried it, and pressing on the screen made crackling go away. The second I stop pressing it comes back.
Anyone else? Phone was fine for the first week."	R
Notification sound every ~5 minutes	"I got the S22 and I'm using Sony WH1000xm4 headphones to listen to music. I'm a ping sound every 5 minutes and it is is driving me crazy (it might also be happening when I'm not listening to music, not sure). I can't figure out what exactly the notification is (doesn't give any icon in the pulldown menu)
Here's what I've tried so far:
I've gone into Settings &gt; Notifications &gt; ""More"" &gt; and manually disabled every single app. Notably disabled even Weather and Emergency Alerts
I've already put the phone on do not disturb, with the only exceptions being Calls, Messages, Alarms, Media sound, Calendar events. No App exceptions. 
I've disabled the option to make an alert if there is an unread message when you grab the phone.
I turned on Notification History in hopes of tracking down what is making the sound - but the sound goes off regularly and nothing is showing up in Notification History.
Still making the noise - this is so incredibly distracting and detrimental to getting work done. Anyone else getting this? Is this something other than a notification?"	R

The original Galaxy Buds don't have a Game Mode, but I have tried toggling Dolby Atmos (both the main toggle and for gaming), downgrading the Galaxy Buds app from whatever version it is now to what it was in my S10 (v1.8.20102651, which temporarily fixed it but has since reverted to lagging), disabling and enabling performance-related Game Plugins, disconnecting and reconnecting the earbuds, re-pairing them, and the only thing that seems to fix it temporarily is toggling HD audio off in the developer settings when the game is running."

Issues connecting with 5G	I recently got the Galaxy S22 Plus with T-Mobile and it's been great, but I've had issues connecting with 5G. The 5G signal goes out completely (as in bars for singal) for about 10-20 seconds and returns quickly, but this happens multiple times a day. I've taken all the steps of doing a factory reset, network reset, making sure I have the right SIM card, restarting the phone, etc. I don't know what the issue could be.	R
My s22 ultra screen lags/delays in games	So I recently bought the galaxy s22 ultra. Since I bought it I've noticed it has been not very responsive at all in any of the games I play, including dbdm, codm, and apexm. In all of these games, especially codm, the game tends to respond perfectly but with a large delay. Is there any way to fix this? I've heard that Samsung has been throttling gaming performance with gos in s22 series, is the next update going to fix this or is this a different issue?? Thanks 🙏	R
WhatsApp audio recording quality sucks	"I have the small S22 and the WhatsApp audio recording quality sucks. It sounds muffled no matter how I hold the phone. A cross check with 2 different voice recorder apps and also the video camera showed that it is a WhatsApp problem.
It becomes really obvious when you lock the audio recording button. Then you can listen to the recording again before sending it. It sounds very bright and clear at first and completely bad after sending.
It seems to be a compression or EQ issue which didn't show up on my previous device (S8). 
Can anyone confirm this?"	R
Music App song change Popups not showing?	"Not sure if this is specific to Android or One UI, but just updated to an s22+ plus and noticed that when the song changes on my music app, it does not display as a pop-up like on my old phone (OnePlus 6).
I went on to test this with several music apps, including Spotify, and the popups never appeared on track change.
Is this something not supported by One UI?"	R

Samsung Galaxy S22 S Pen Disconnections	"I'm looking to collect some data / opinions on if this has happened to anyone else.
Last week, out of the box, my new S22 Ultra and it's S Pen seemed to work perfectly fine. Once I had gotten all of my apps setup, I then noticed that everytime I took the S Pen out of the phone (after it had been in there at least 15-20 minutes), I would get a long connection attempt, followed by an ""S Pen Disconnected"" notification. Which then takes another 60-120 seconds to fix by reinserting the pen etc.
I tried all of the support steps you'd expect (reset the pen, system cache clear etc.) to no avail. I reset the phone ready to send it for exchange but then got it working perfectly again with a fresh install.
I slowly reinstalled all my apps and seemed to have no issues. Last night I finally got down to setting up the last few apps with permissions, logins and syncs (the low priority apps I have) and suddenly the behavior came back (albeit a little less consistently, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't).
Has anyone else experienced anything like this either now or with a past S Pen device? It feels like it's some software conflict or setting corruption that somehow interfaces with the pen, but I uninstalled most apps I had set up yesterday one by one and the behaviour still remained.
Really reticent to send it back for exchange since absolutely everything else works perfectly, and moreover, if it is a software thing I could be without a phone for a week or two only for it to happen again!"	R
Screen dims when phone gets warm	"I was most excited to get the S22U because of the increased brightness over my Note 20U. While it's a brighter phone, it's actually dimmer than the Note 20 if the phone gets warm. I'm assuming this is to protect the phone from getting too warm but it makes it totally unusable in the sun and in an all year warm weather climate like I'm in. I realize most here won't have this issue now because it's cold in most places. But I'm curious to see if others in warm climates are having the same issues or if my phone is defective.  
The phone doesn't even have to get hot. Just warm enough from the sun hitting the glass and doing mild processor demand work like surfing the web, etc.  
The way you can tell it's force-dimming is when you take the dimmer bar past 50% it doesn't get any brighter. It's basically fixed on 50%. I also noticed that the dimming is restricted more the warmer the phone gets.  
I recall having this issue with my Note 10 but was not an issue with my Note 20. So I'm very disappointed that I got a huge downgrade in a very important function for me - being able to read my phone in the sun."	R

RCS messaging is a disaster. Here's my experience.	"I was very excited about RCS and decided to give it a try. After two weeks, it's a big mess and I'm porting my number back to Google Voice. Here's my experience and observations:
Context: I live in the U.S., have a new unlocked Samsung Galaxy S22, and use Tello as my carrier.  
* Can't send pictures, or any media, over WiFi. I need to be connected to a mobile network to send.
* Can't respond to group texts on WiFi, because Android treats group texts as MMS.
* Most of my friends use iPhone, so messaging defaults to SMS
* Most Android users don't know about SMS, so messaging defaults to SMS
* RCS only works if the other user uses Google Messages and they turn on the ""Chat"" feature. Even then, it's spotty because carriers have their own implementation of RCS.
*  **The idea that, in 2022, I have to send messages through phone lines instead of the internet like every other messaging app is absurd!**
* Google Messages app is used for messaging only. You have to start phone calls and video calls in separate apps.
* For Samsung phones, they've re-skinned Google Messages leaving the top half of the app empty. Can't revert back to standard Google Messages easily.
* It seems like RCS is dependent on the phone, app, and carrier.
* Android phones in the U.S. come with 3 messaging apps - ones from Google, the manufacturer, and carrier. On the Samsung Verizon variant, these three apps are all called Messages with similar app icons. There's too much fragmentation in the Android messaging world.
* I don't like having my primary phone number being tied to a physical SIM card and a particular carrier.
* The messages are being sent and stored on my phone versus on a server where I can pull down from any device.
* Why can't Google make a decent IP-based iMessage competitor instead of trying to rehash 2007 technology?
TLDR: RCS is a big mess. I don't recommend it."	R

Anyone have YouTube or YouTube Music NOT loading?	"About 50% of the time, videos and audio from YouTube or YouTube music won't load past 7-10 seconds. It's like it stops buffering. On T-Mobile 5G network.
I've cleared cache on the apps, cycled my data and airplane modes, and rebooted the phone.
It seems to only be happening while on mobile data, but it's hard to tell because I use other devices besides my phone for media at home. I had an S10 before and never had the problem.

Bixby routines not working for anyone else?	"Hey S22 guys and gals. Has anybody else experienced Bixby Routines funkiness or just plain ole not working on the S22? I went from an S10+ to an S22 Ultra and all I want is for my hotspot to turn on when I connect to my cars bluetooth. 
I've only had this routine work one or two times on the S22 Ultra. I've tried restarting and turning off any battery saver as well as clearing all the Bluetooth devices, re-pairing, and adding the routine back. Even with my phone clearly connected to the Bluetooth set as a trigger it doesn't even attempt to turn the hotspot on. 
Much appreciate any feedback you might have on this it's driving me nuts. My car relies on the hotspot for all the infotainment.
Edit: This routine worked flawlessly on my S10+, only had to set up the routine a single time."	R

USB Issue - Is it S22 or Android 12?	"I just traded in two s9s for s22s, and they both are having issues with USB connectivity.  
The first issue has to do with connecting my car to Android Auto, which worked perfectly fine on my previous phone. Sometimes it works, and then suddenly it doesn't. I get an error message saying to replace the USB cord, but once I start getting that message, no USB cord will work. At first when this began to happen, I tried rebooting the phone and then it would work. The last time it happened, even rebooting didn't fix it, but then I uninstalled the Android Auto app, reinstalled it, re-booted and then it worked with no issues. 
The second issue has to do with using a USB dongle to plug in wired headphones. Again, it sometimes works and sometimes cuts in and out. Rebooting will make it work for a while, but then it goes on the blink again. 
To repeat, I'm having these issues with both phones and multiple USB cords, all of which are high quality. 
The fact that a reboot or a reinstall of software temporarily solves the issues, would indicate to me that this is a software, not a hardware issue. 
Anyone else experiencing this? Is it an S22 problem, or does this happen on other phones with Android 12?"	R
Anyone Else Having This Issue? Can't read the options of any app permissions.		R
Swipe when I tap?	"Basically,  the S22 treats me like I'm swiping when I'm really tapping. 
When I go to tap, or click, on something, half the time the phone acts as if I swiped instead.  Tap an icon on the home screen? Instead of opening the app, it brings up the page of apps. Click on a web link? The page scrolls up instead. Try to open an email or text? The message gets deleted and I have to quickly tap undo.
Is there some setting I can adjust to stop this?"	R
Touch delay on base S22	"Sometimes whenever I open an app or my keyboard or goes to my home screen there's like a 1 or 2 second delay where my touch isnt registering. Is this happening with anyone else? I do have a screen protector on and have touch sensitivity I increased though
Edit: This is semi-resolved. If you're using gestures, try going back to the 3 button navigation. That got rid of the delay for me"	R

call sounds robotic	I was wondering if anyone is experiencing calls sounding robotic at times. I have the S22 ultra and I have WI FI calling turned on. On my old Note 20 ultra I never had this issue. Several times now talking to my mother or my sister at times during the call there voice would sound robotic and in slow motion sounding. These calls are taking place inside my home. I have restarted my phone and my WI FI modem. I remember several years ago this was common for me and eventually just turned off WI FI calling completely. I am also on Verizon if that makes a difference at all.	R

Not super impressed with the battery life.	"Am I the only one? Now granted it's not terrible since it's 5000mah battery but it seems about the same or slightly worse than my S22 Ultra was. 
I'm also using WQHD as well which might factor in it.

Screen color vibrance/saturation on S22 seems washed out a bit	Just upgraded from an S10 to s22 on Verizon and I'm still kind of undecided if it was worth the upgrade.

Is there anything I can do to add more color vibrance to the display?	R
Galaxy S22 Ultra WiFi issues.	"I periodically see WiFi connection speed slowdowns on S22 Ultra. The browser pages load slowly, YouTube videos buffer. The WiFi speed comes to normal after I toggle the WiFi radio, but becomes slow again over time. 
All my other devices work well over WiFi and the router connection is good at 500 Mbps. 
Didn't see anyone posted about this issue on this forum.
I searched around and there are multiple people experiencing the same problem with WiFi on S22 Ultra. The workaround is to use static IP or 2.4GHz radio.

I don't understand "do not disturb"	"Hi all. I don't understand the do not disturb function. I turn it on at night to allow calls and messages only from my contacts and also exclude notifications from apps like YouTube etc. It's the schedule I don't understand.  
I thought it was straight forward. Turn on do not disturb. Do not disturb is on till I turn it off manually. Then in settings I see an option to set a schedule with a default suggested schedule time. Great, so I set the default schedule time.  
The notification panel still says do not disturb is on till I turn it off manually. No matter how I set the schedule, do not disturb does not turn off automatically via the schedule.

S22 Ultra Selfie Camera - Camera Failed	Every time I switch to the selfie camera in the app, it gives the notification "Warning - Camera Failed". This then repeats every time the camera app is opened unless I go to app settings and clear cache and data for the camera app. I tried restarting the phone with "repair apps" from the boot menu, that did nothing. Has anyone else experienced this and found a solution? Seems that otherwise, the selfie camera simply will be unusable.--Update:Booting in Safe Mode allowed the camera to work properly, and it is still working now after then normally booting. Still, something is causing this issue. I suppose some sort of downloaded app. If that's the case, has anyone found what that app is? I have mostly just social media apps installed.	R
Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra Intermittent Camera Failed	Samsung Galaxy S22 UltraThis seems to be a recurring issue with others having issues. I suspect it is down to the camera app due to the nature. I have followed all the troubleshooting steps and even done a factory reset. The camera failed can happen over the Portrait, Photo or Video modes and is intermittent over which one it affects. It can be resolved by changing settings quickly in one of the failed modes ie blur focus zoom where it will work for a while before you get camera failed again. There does not seem to be a pattern when it fails, hence me thinking it is an app issue.Anyone else having similar issues or have had it resolved?	R

S22+ Dismal Battery Life	"First time Samsung user, decided to get the S22+ especially after reading all the reviews praising the battery life. However, I don't think the same way after using my phone for about 2 weeks now?

S22 Ultra AT&T - not downloading messages!!!	Is anyone else on AT&T having issues with messages not downloading? Wasted over 3 hours on chat with AT&T & Samsung tech support. They had no clue. Both techs even remote accessed my phone - reset settings. I'd love to have everything working the way it should, even if I dont have vanilla google messages, but this is a serious effing issue. Missing messages especially for work can get you fired. On both individual & group texts I randomly get this little bubble that says tap to download and sometimes if I don't see it in time it times out and I can never see what was sent. I tried all the info online about disabling chat features via the Google site. Even put my Sim back in my previous Note 10 plus phone and disabled advanced chat features in old messages app and even downloaded Google messages and disabled chat features from there (even tho I never used Google messages on that phone) They even tried to put me back on the old samsung messages app and the issue persists.I have the 512gb snapdragon version.

Group Texts received as both group and individual texts - Android issue	Have had my Galaxy S22 less than two weeks, however, this issue is also currently occurring on a Galaxy S20. Have gone through multiple levels of tech support at AT&T, and at Samsung, and AT&T store manager said today he has now seen this issue from multiple people starting a few days ago. Have performed every step recommended by AT&T and Samsung, leading me to believe this is not a network or phone-specific issue but an Android issue: once I become part of a group text, every message posted by other members to the thread results in two texts being received, one in the group chat from the poster, and one from the poster to me, however, those individual texts cannot be retrieved or downloaded. I am assuming they are duplicates, or some kind of data or articfact about the post, however, I cannot know for sure without seeing the post.In addition, it is not possible to remove the posts, even once they expire, unless you delete the entire individual thread, which means loss of all prior texts. Also, because they are "unread," periodically, the message app reminds me of unread messages. I now have at least two dozen of these and they are multiplying. This same issue began occurring on a Galaxy S20 earlier this week, which seems to confirm my suspicion it is not a phone-specific issue. While I guess it could still be some kind of network issue, I strongly suspect something went sideways in the most recent Messaging app update. This is the Google messaging app, not the native Samsung messaging app.For the love of everything holy, could the developers please stop updating apps like Messaging, which has worked relatively well for 10,000 years, at least for one whole week?

Membership cards in Samsung Pay won't scan	Has anyone had any issues with membership cards scanning? My old phone (Note 9) had a proximity sensor that wasn't under the glass and Samsung Pay used it to "beam" the barcode to the scanner, so it always worked.

When I play the same game on my old S10 I don't experience anything like it. I thought that Samsung used a lot of new tech to keep this phone cool. Anyone experience anything like this?	R
software bugs that i experienced (SoT, charging info, UI).	"Hello,
So in my experience the device isnt recording the sot properly, its bugged. I watched a 2+ hour movie just after fully charging and unplugging and it showed 50m screen on and 2h screen off time, i wasent drunk or sleep deprived or hallucinating. I am 100% sure it was wrong. It has happened on more than one instance. Sometimes after the battery is close to dying it would show 9m screen on time. Like i am certain its happening. But its not always but how can i be sure of the 4 5 or 6 h sot it is showing at the end if its correct or not.
Charging info bug, device un plugged from charger, lock screen and AOD still shows charging paused to protect battery message.
UI bug, i have experienced freezes. Like it froze on the lock screen once. Choppy scrolling a couple of times. Notification panel froze once. 
Deep sleep apps: apps dont go to deep sleep, youtube is put to deep sleep, which means its disabled as soon as i close it and clear from memory, but i keep getting notifications of uploads likes etc which means the app is not on deep sleep.
Same with reddit, i keep getting notifications even tho its put to deep sleep.
I paid approx 1500 $ for it so i think i can feel bad about this situation."	R
Stuck Pixels that appear and dissapear	"Looks like I will have to do an exchange.  The cluster of blue stuck pixels appeared about two weeks after getting it.  Did a reboot and power down and the issue would show up right away during the boot process.  I called my carrier and arranged to send it back which they will then send me a new replacement.  When I went to do a factory reset, the issue disappeared!  I was happy about that and considered even keeping it but it re-appeared again briefly only to fix itself again on it's own.  I have never had experience with this before but I have a bad feeling it's going to keep coming back.  It's about a two week turn around which is a pain but I don't think I have a choice anymore but the send it back for a replacement.  Has anyone else had this issue?

Normal apps throttling even after March update?	"I'm using several photo editing apps on my phone and the performance on my S22 gets really horrendous after a while. I even made a test and was doing the exact same thing on my old S10 simultaneously and my old S10 was FASTER at the end and the S22 almost came to a stop. The good test is when I export the image in the exportation process shows percentages and it takes about 30 seconds on my old S10, about 15 seconds on my S22 at the beginning but at the end, after about 30 minutes, it doesn't even finish. I was using High and Maximum processing speed on the S22. Using Optimized makes things a bit better regarding the slowdown but it's slower in general, not much faster than S10. I mean, what the heck, I thought at least the processor is going to be faster on S22 than the S10, if the resolution is lower, no SD slot, no earphones jack, no heart rate sensor, etc.
So, do you still experience slowdowns in processor-intensive apps (not games!) after March update?"	R
AT&amp;T S22 Ultra: MMS Will Not Download	"I'm going nuts.  Never had this issue on my S21 Ultra.  My MMS will not download about 80% of the time.  Has anyone else been experiencing this?
I've tried:
* Reset Network Settings
* Tried both Google Messages and Samsung Messages
* Disabled Advanced Messaging/RCS
* Turned Off Wi-Fi
* Manually created APN according to AT&amp;T's website
* Reset Messages app (both Google and Samsung)
* Re-seat SIM card
I'm at a loss and it's extremely frustrating.  This is from multiple recipients."	R
Video recording suddenly randomly becomes choppy. Has been happing consistently	"Me and GF are practicing for a dance. So we record a lot of practice videos. Almost 50 percent of the time, the video will become choppy.
Complete skipping and frame drops. Then it will get better.
Settings : FHD 60fps
Auto FPS : Off
An example :https://streamable.com/22e01t
(There's 2 minutes of video before, that was flawless. Then in this clip there's a chop at second 3 and the recoding quality takes a dip. Another chop around 12 seconds) 
This isn't a one time thing. The behavior is producable at every other attempt.
IMO, this is completely unacceptable. At a device costing 1k+. The most  premium
android smartphones. 
We ended up switching to my girlfriends iPhone 12 due to this. That old device does it flawlessly every single time. 
So embarrassing. 
And you can't even blame the SD card anymore. Or the light condition or movements. The camera is on Tripod and the lighting is same through out the dance."	R
Adaptive battery increasing drain?	"Amongst the chaff of moons and battery day 1 questions, I'd like to see if anyone had success with disabling adaptive battery to somehow improve battery drain.
Here is an old reddit thread about that
https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS20FE/comments/p2j30u/update_on_battery_drain_issue_i_completely_fixed/
Optimizing guide here also mentions it
https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/no-root-samsung-optimization-guide-debloat-tweaks-settings-and-adb.4376755/
So far it ironically seems to help.
s22 base
adaptive battery off. 
adaptive power on
auto optimization on
all little used / notification or sync not required apps placed manually into deep sleep
NFC disabled unless using samsung pay
5g disabled. mostly wifi calling
good guardian battery saver on
good guardian app optimizer run
main apps: samsung internet, redreader, Amazon music, Garmin connect
Bluetooth on
no gaming
occasional YouTube (about 20 min per charge)
had phone since the 23rd
no smart switch 
I only charge up to 85% and do not take it under 20, so I do not see that total from the default battery view 
gsam estimated average went from 4.5 hr SOT to about 5 hr 15 min. seems to be in the ballpark
accubattery in its eternal optimism estimates 9 hrs and 45 minutes from 100 to zero with a 10%/ hr SOT drain. lol.
anyone else disabling adaptive battery? thinking the dude might be right about the constant scanning actually does take more juice than actual dynamic optimization does.
I'm digging that coconut pic that one person posted."	R
why does oneui drain so much battery on my s22?		R

S22 Ultra photo quality not what I was expecting	"I am coming from a note 8 to the S22 ultra. It seems like with the ultra sometimes the photos turn out amazing but other times not so much. I don't know if there is a setting I'm missing or I need to turn on/off. It seems like my note 8 was more consistent with its photo quality. 
When the S22 ultra gets it right the photos blow me away. I've attached some pics from my note 8 and s22 ultra to compare. I tried to get them as close as possible and took the photos back to back. Any feedback or pointers would be greatly appreciated."	R
Does S22 smaller varient overheat?	"I have pre-ordered s22 -256gb varient and it will get delivered on 1st April. Today, I went to checkout s22 in Samsung store and played a bit with the phone.The phone display looked great and size it quite good. 
These store phones are always connected via USB cable and  on  charging mode and it was mildly hot. Then after 15 min of browsing, I got a popup about software update and I triggered it. 😬
After the update which took around 10 min, the phone was super hot. I downloaded cpu-z app to check the temperature. The cpu temperature was 54 degrees Celsius and battery temperature was 44 degrees😳.
Has anyone faced this issue yet?"	R
HDR issues on S22 Ultra	"I have posted yesterday regarding on the HDR problems on the S22 Ultra, the issue being the screen dimming after moving the brightness slider to increase brightness. Some have spectucalated it may be due to the Vision Booster Samsung had bragged about. If so, I would like to know how to disable Vision Booster and publish a software update to fix the issue?
Please upvote this to gain more attention and for Samsung themselves to acknowledge this issue  to fix this issue ASAP. One of the main features of this phone is for maximum viewing pleasure but how can I enjoy when the brightness is so dark and there is nothing I can do to increase the brightness?
Edit: I found a video which has the same issue:

Skintones are green, and other color issues.	"I've tried the ""vivid"" and ""natural"" screen modes, the white balance, and the RGB sliders in advanced settings. But the color of faces and skintones is still a sickly green on my new S22.
I am comparing it to a calibrated TV, and IMac, and a Note8 (best phone I've ever owned).
The screen seems to be fine, although the color modes could use some work: ""vivid"" gives neon green grass, and ""natural"" can't get good saturation for vivid colors like Coca-Cola red.
Overall, my 3-year-old Note8 outperforms, except for the black point and white point.
I tried a few apps but the overlay mode broke the interface. Any other ideas?"	R
Google Messages update breaking more things	In addition to RCS not working on AT&amp;T since day one, yesterday's update broke Google Messages for Web. Lost pairing to my phone and the only way to fix it is to uninstall the Messages update. Getting more ridiculous.	R

Galaxy s22 ultra Battery	I was wondering if it was just me but it seems that once my [S22 ultra] hits 10% battery. It goes from a battery percentage to a second timer...

Wifi Calling / Zoom using S22 Ultra 512 Orbi Mesh	Coming from the Note 20 Ultra 5G an issue with the S22 Ultra has been problematic with WiFi Calling, Zoom, Webex while using wireless. The Note 20 is capable of having wifi Calling, zoom meeting with no issues on my Orbi Mesh network. My home circuit is a 1GB Frontier fiber service with no issues present across all devices except when using the S22 Ultra wifi Calling capabilities or Zoom meetings using wifi audio. I've reset the phone, reloaded just Zoom meetings and enabled wifi Calling and the audio s.l.o.w.s way down the plays catch up if it recovers. If it doesn't recover the meeting drops or the call drops and reconnects. The Note 20 Ultra does not exhibit this issue side by side. Same Zoom meeting with Note 20 Ultra works perfect and no issue while the S22 Ultra struggles to produce the audio. Wifi Calling has the exact same issue side by side. Something with the S22 Ultra is out of sorts and hopeful others may have resolved the issue. I appreciate any input.Update: I've confirmed it is a wifi issue only specific to the S22 line.Is it the performance controls will be answered after Samsung provides a firmware update.However, using the phone on Verizon 4G /5G servixe my Zoom meeting work perfectly as do the webex.If Wifi is enabled the call may continue but will begin struggling to keep audio and will slow way down.A flip back to cellular and the problem is resolved.I used a Verizon 5G UW home connection with 1.5GB down and 700MB up with a 3ms ping and 2 jitter.The issue was presnt during thoze Zoom meeting and wifi calling as well.Definitly a Samsung S22 Ultra issue.ThanksComputim	R
S22 Ultra network issues	Hey y'all,I'm hoping someone here can help me resolve this issue. I recently switched to an unlocked S22 ultra bought from the Samsung experience store out where I'm at. Due to the 3g sunset & my previous phone model not being compatible with the new network I upgraded. Unfortunately ever since, I have had the same issue I had with my previous phone, a note 8, on the s22 ultra. That is, I'm unable to make or receive phone calls even the this phone is supposed to be compatible with the new network I can however, like before, send/receive text messages & access mobile data.My question here is if anyone has experienced this problem & if so, how did you got about resolving it?I'm presently going through my cell provider AT&T to see if it's an issue on their end. As of yet no luck, they're still looking into it.Any help would be appreciated.	R
Data with 2nd sim during calls	I have all setting right it just stopped working.If I made a call on sim 1 I could use data on sim 2. It just stopped working the only setting I ever messed with was dual sim always on but I put it back since then it won't work. Now if I make a call on sim 1 sim 2 loses connection within 3 sec so it's doing the opposite with settings on.	R
Big issues with latest update	To the point:1. Suggested apps are now ALWAYS Settings, calculator, calendar, and clock instead of apps that I typically/recency used.2.

Still seeing wifi issue after upgrade to March updates	I noticed that my S22 ultra would throttle the wifi speed if I am doing a VoIP call in the instant messenger app, today I used TMobile sim card to upgrade to March patch, I still have the same issue. If I do the same test on my s20, no such problem. You might wanna try a similar test.	R
App compatibility issues	Most filters are not able to be used on certain apps: instagram/ tik-tok. You wouldn't expect a flagship s22 ultra to have these issues. Also wifi calling stopped working for some reason after working for a week when purchased	R

S22 Ultra Black Screen When Posting FB stories	I got my new s22 ultra - when posting fb stories with pictures or videos together with music the post will go black! The picture or video will appear all black but you can hear the music or see Gifs! This happens on facebook stories but IG is working. I called Samsung customer service but they deny that this is a known issue! But there's already a lot of s22 users complaining about this but there's no fix as of now! A lot of customers bought s22 ultra hoping this is the android phone that can compete with iphone 13 in terms of better pics and videos so we can have better pics or videos to post on social media but this is a let down. Even some filters are not working in this s22 ultra!	R

S22 Ultra Verizon eSim issue	Ordered an unlocked S22 Ultra phone that shipped directly from Samsung. The phone could not be connected/registered with the Verizon service using the eSim card. I worked extensively with Verizon (6 hours) and Samsung (1.5 hours) attempting to resolve the issues.There was no indication that Verizon nor Samsung would solve the problem in the short-term allowing the simultaneous use of both the eSim for Verizon and the physical Sim for local use when traveling to foreign countries. A solution was offered to add a physical Verizon Sim card which would totally defeat the purpose of having an eSim at all.This experience with the S2 Ultra has been very disappointing and has not worked for me as advertised. I am returning the phone and will not reorder until such time as this issue has been clearly resolved. I am not certain how to even know when this issue is resolved.	R

eSIM activation issues on S22+	Verizon is not able to activate the eSIM on my unlocked S22+. The store couldn't do it and gave me a traditional SIM card and told me to call Verizon directly. Over an hour + on the phone with them and they've not been able to activate my eSIM!	R
Galaxy S22 Ultra S-Pen Issue	Is anyone else having issues with their S-Pen constantly disconnecting from their S22 Ultra and requiring pairing almost every time you remove the S-Pen from its slot?I would say my S-Pen requires reconnection 3/5 times I use it. I'm going from a Note 9 and I rarely had any issues with my S-Pen disconnecting and needing reconnecting.Solved!Go to Solution.	R
Update did not fix camera.	I finally got the new March 1 update for my S22 Ultra, 512gb (Unlocked) and it did not fix the issues with the camera that I've had since I first unboxed it. Video in 60fps is HORRIBLE and still so jittery, does not run at 60fps, and not even at 30fps in that 60fps mode. It will rarely ever maintain 60fps in 3x or 10x, but then eventually gets jittery and wavy when looking around. My S21 Ultra never had this problem. Considering getting rid of this and going back now...	R

S22 ultra 5ghz wifi issue	Ive seen this be quite a problem. Including me people are having a common issue where the wifi is intermittent on their phones, often. Unusable. It seems to be only affecting 5ghz networks atm and turning to 2.4ghz fixes the issue but also limits our networking.	R
Samsung s22 ultra - Network connection failed message	Has anyone gotten this message on the galaxy s22 ultra?I pre-ordered and received on 2/23 and by the next day, I started to receive this message and only happened when unlocking the phone and even while on a call.It would come up for about one second and go away.Never lost any connection, but the message was bugging me.Did not happen every single time, but it happens enough to cause concern.It happened while on wifi, it happened while being only on mobile data, in happened in the house, at work, while being a passenger in a vehicle, it happened anywhere.I went to the local at&t store and after 30 minutes of waiting, the person there stood with me for 2 minutes and said that was normal and that he also gets on his note 8..I told him that this is a new phone and I had an older one and he said that there was nothing he could do and to call 611.Made 8 calls to at&t and 3 to Samsung.Each time some trouble shooting was performed and 3 times had to do different forms of reset the phone which wiped everything out each time and I needed to start setup again.Each time I called, I had to go over my story and explain the same thing each time, even though I asked them to read the notes on prior calls, but each time had to do it and each time they tried something else.Finally had someone that after I asked sevaral times they said they would send me a new phone..Not sure what the issue was, but I hope it does not happen on my new phone that is on its way.If someone is experiencing this, please post what the solution was..Thanks 	R
S22 Does Not Connect To Pioneer Radio	My Note 10 worked fine in my car with the Android Auto app; however, the new S22 will not recognize Android Auto app, nor will my car recognize the S22. I have a 2021 Pioneer Radio. The S22 works fine in my husband's 2020 Kia. The Manger of the Xfinity Store in Cumming, GA, sat in my car and also could not make it work. Also, the new S22 under Playstore does not allow you to download the app Aftershokz. It only has the app Aftershokz Pro. I had to buy a $179 Aftershokz Pro to use a headset so I could talk on my phone in my car. I go tomorrow to a car stereo shop to see how much it will cost to exchange out my car radio to be able to connect my S22. This has been very frustrating. The Xfinity store said it would probably cost me less to change out my radio, than the cost to trade in my S22 for an S21. Check all the complaints on the Samsung S22 Reviews. It is not just me! Thanks for your help.	R
S22 Ultra 512 Battery Drain.	I had an unlocked 256gb S22 Ultra and had good battery. I decided to change it for a 512gb and over the last 2 days the battery drain is ridiculous. I'm losing 10% every hour. This phone will not last all day compared to my S21 Ultra.I am a little disappointed because I had this phone and battery was fine. I just wanted a larger memory. The other phone had issues with staying connected.3 hours and and almost 60%. I have 14 days before j can return this so if it doesn't improve I will stick with my s21 Ultra	R
What Samsung Shoddy USB-C port?	Hello got a new problem the USB port is messing up on my phone when I lightly touch the charging cable that came with the device it disconnects and reconnects. What gift Samsung are you not doing the quality control that you should be doing my phone company is going to replace the phone thank goodness. But bad pool, $1,400 cell phone and you can't even get the USB C Port right. Everybody please pay attention if you are using your phone do not plug it in while you're using it unless it's dead and you're in a call even so I wouldn't.I woke up this morning and I touch my cord and it disconnected everything so I thought okay maybe need to be connected by a plugged it and plugged it back in and it started doing it again and that part gets gradually worse. So I don't understand why they can be this bad. Be careful and I hope it doesn't happen to you.. has anybody else have this problem on the ultra or any of the s line?	R

terrible 3X optical lens photos after March update	I have the US unlocked S22 ultra on Verizon. Has anyone else noticed the 3X optical lens photos are now less saturated and slightly more over exposed than before? Especially when compared to the other 3 lenses?

Straight lines when switching to the rear camera?	So today I went in to work early and I wanted to take a picture. When I opened the camera to my surprise I saw evenly spaced vertical parallel lines on my rear camera. I cleaned the lenses which didn't look dirty anyway and it persisted the next 3x I opened the camera.

Issues with Echo Auto Bluetooth and S22 Ultra (Snapdragon)	"Evening folks!
I've recent upgraded from a Note 9 and I've noticed the connection to my Echo Auto seems to suddenly degrade at random intervals. The sound becomes completely unintelligible and choppy. If I power cycle the Echo Auto, the issue goes away for a while but then it comes back later. I've tried everything on my phone but I can't seem to find anything that fixes it permanently.

When I'm on the home screen and try to swipe up to access recent apps, I have to swipe up and hold for 2-3 seconds before it shows recent apps. On my OnePlus 9 5G I am able to swipe up and hold for about half a second before it shows recent apps. Is there a way to reduce the swipe and hold time?  
Also, swiping up opens the search bar which is why I have to swipe and hold for recent apps, which is what I want, but I don't want to swipe and hold for so long"	R

S22 Ultra Will Not Check For System Software Update	When I check for the latest software update on my Ultra it doesn't appear to be actually going out and looking for the update like normal. It just says software version is current instead of the spinning circle saying checking for update. I have 2 other S22s on ATT (one ultra, one base s22) that downloaded and installed the update yesterday, but mine will not for some reason. I have tried wiping the cache partition and clearing some other app cahce but my phone still does not appear to be checking for the latest version.

Snapchat notifications not working	Hi. I got my S22 3 days ago and i didn't get any snapchat notifications since then.

Fingerprint sensor and trusted places	Noticing some weirdness with my s22 with regard to the fingerprint sensor and trusted places. During the day the fingerprint sensor works very reliably, probably 99% accuracy. But in the evening, and I can't totally pinpoint it, but it seems like after around 7:00 p.m. it just turns to crap and hardly ever works. Coupled with that, my house is a trusted place for the smart lock. During the day, Smart Lock seems to work flawlessly, not requiring authentication when I'm at the house. But like the fingerprint sensor, sometime in the evening it starts to go wonky and hardly ever works. Is this just some weird coincidence or anyone have some guesses as to what might be going on?	R

bluetooth connectivity	Does anyone have issues with their s22U taking forever to connect to their cars Bluetooth? My s10+ was super fast after I started the car, almost instantly. My s22u takes well over a minute every time. Small issue, but still annoying.	R
Bluetooth problematic	Tried pairing with my car audio. Will play music via Bluetooth from my phone but will not do Hands free calling. Worked on my S9. Works on my wife's S20. Doesn't work with my S22. Internet suggestions don't help. Samsung tech support doesn't help. Not really looking for answers here. Just wanted to know if other people are experiencing the same. A second S22 Ultra I tried also will play sound through car system but not make calls.	R

Can't change USB control to this device (couldn't switch error)	"I just upgraded from my galaxy s10.  My old phone was plugged into a USB hub in my car that had a USB DAC connected directly to my car stereo, I would just plug it in and it would charge and simultaneously play music over the DAC.  My S22 won't charge with the same setup, I'm pretty sure because it says USB is controlled by connected device instead of this device.  It just says couldn't switch when I try.  It's like the phone is trying to charge the USB hub instead of vice versa.  
I've tried various cable and USB hubs, it seems to be a software setting in the Galaxy?"	R

Twitter scrolling issues.	It's not just Twitter. Reddit is bad too. My S22U stutters severely when scrolling in Reddit and Twitter. Is it very annoying, almost gives me motion sickness. Like why Samsung, we have 120Hz and a top of the line phone and when looking at Twitter or other apps it instantly makes it feel like a cheap phone. Can we please fix this? Problem is fixed when switching to 60 Hz BTW.	R

Lag.	My 1TB USA unlocked Galaxy S22 ultra with SD processor lags. I noticed the 256 gb one also lags. I've checked the settings, Battery optimization is off and I also turned off GOS. I've tried with and without animations, to no avail.This is terrible and utterly unacceptable. I've purchased 3 S22 ultras. Two have arrived and are off-puttingly lagtastic.	R
S22 Ultra won't connect to cellular network less than 5G	Starting about 2 weeks ago my brand new phone stopped making calls or using data unless I had a 5G connection which is limited where I live. I have t-mobile. They have tried 2 different Sim cards and I even took it into the store for a technician to look at and they cannot determine why it isn't connecting. I have an appointment at a samsung care center this afternoon but I am extremely disappointed with this phone. It was working great then suddenly it became almost useless away from home or work. Anyone else have this issue?	R
Most recent update 3/22/22	I noticed my fingerprints wouldn't work as well as it did before the most recent update. The new update seemed to have had an effect on the device reading saved fingerprints. Please remove and re-log your fingerprints, if that's what you use to unlock your phone.	R
No longer seeing Tenor gifs	Not sure when this happened, but when I initially was messaging people, I had the ability to send gifs from Tenor and Giphy.

I checked the settings and it still shows that it should be grabbing gifs from both Tenor and Giphy, and I pushed an update and still the issue persists. Any help would be greatly appreciated.	R
Front camera issue : Warning : Camera Failer	Hi,Just received my brand new Samsung Galaxy S22 256 Go from Samsung pre-order, and less than one week after, the front camera worked twice:- First time when I registered my face for the face unlock feature- Second time, after contacting Samsung Customer Support who advised only to do a parameter reset of the phone which I did and a factory reset which I did not because I am sure it is software related. The camera worked only once after the parameter reset.Based on what I found on the web to solve this already known issue on many Samsung Galaxy phones, I of course reset the camera parameters, cleared the cache and data of both the camera and gallery applications without effect - I also ran the phone in recovery mode without success to make sure it is not due to a third party app.Frustruation is big for 900 USD phone - i would expect Samsung to have a mature ROM system prior to releasing its new flag ship ! This would never happen with Apple on iPhoness !!!Now waiting for the next ROM softare update, hoping it will solve the issue.	R
T-Mobile online activation is still not working	Back during the Galaxy S22 pre-order period from Feb 12 to 14, I ran into an issue trying to take advantage of the additional $50 discount for using T-Mobile online activation. When you select this discount, during checkout you're prompted to sign into your T-Mobile account using your phone number and PIN/passcode and it doesn't work. You get an error that says "Something went wrong. Please try again later." but it never works later. Yes, I've verified that I'm using the correct PIN so that's not the issue. This issue was reported by another customer right after the S22 pre-order period started 5-6 weeks ago and it's still not fixed. I work in IT and there's clearly some kind of authentication issue occurring between Samsung and T-Mobile. Here's a screen shot of the error.The old discussion in the community that I participated in back in February appears to have been deleted because the link to the thread doesn't work and I don't see my comments from that thread in my posting history anymore. Samsung must have deleted the discussion because it was never fixed.Samsung, please address this issue.	R
No app update notifications	"On my Pixel 2XL, I would always get notification shade update alerts for apps that had updates in the Play Store. On this S22 Ultra I do not get those. In order to see if there are any updates, I need to open the Play Store App and manually check. I have verified every setting I can find that might control this and still am left completely unaware of any app updates unless I go to the Play Store App>My Profile>Manage Apps & device. Then it will check for updates, and I can manually update if any are found. 
I have read that some say this is normal behavior now. But others say that no, they still get notified right in their shade and can then update from there. 
Can anyone enlighten me on this? I really want to know about app updates without having to remember every day to manually check. But if this is how Google is now forcing it to be done, I will stop trying to chase down the problem in my setup.  
Thanks!"	R
"Auto-Restart" doesn't really "Restart" your phone anymore	"I'm not sure if anyone else noticed this, but apart from asking me to enter my PIN to unlock my phone, the scheduled Auto-Restart is not proper. All my apps are still running in the background and most telling of all, the system uptime clock is WELL beyond however many hours ago the auto restart supposedly took place. 
The reason why this is a problem for me is that a true auto restart really does give my phone a performance boost, whereas this cosmetic one does not. 
Does anyone know how to make the scheduled auto restart a ""true"" restart? Or am I the only one experiencing this?"	R

Getting less AI processed images out of the S22 Ultra	"Hey everyone, just got my S22 Ultra and I am really enjoying it so far, especially the cameras!
However I noticed that some of the images come out too processed in terms of sharpness,colours and detail compared to the preview, probably due to the additional AI postprocessing by the stock app.
Is there are any setting I can tweak or any alternate camera app that I can use to get cleaner/un processed as is images from the cameras?
I have been told about Expert raw and gcam ..do they work as suggested?
Please advice.

Bluetooth stuttering when connected to work van(S22 SD)	"This morning I got in my van and all was well.  Stopped about 10 min later for about 10 min.  Once I got back in the van the audio started stuttering every few seconds.  Here are the things I have tried.
1) reboot
2) moved bt app into unrestricted under battery
3) tried a different app (podcast addict/disney+) w/ no change
4) dev options》 disabled offload a2dp
5) reset radio (using master reset option)
6) unpaired from radio and phone and repaired
7) cleared bt data

9) phone calls seem fine as well
10) just cleared system cache after update a few days ago.  Will try that
Any other suggestions before a reset?"	R
Massive 5G Issue, Does Anyone Else has this Problem?	"Starting yesterday my s22 Ultra refused to maintain a constant 5G connection. I can watch the signal bar go from filled to blank to filed to no-connection over and over. Making sending texts and phone calls impossible as all calls cut out. On top of that, it seems the phone's struggle to maintain the connection also leads to the SOC running like hell, making the phone hot without me even using it and draining the battery to hell. I had to default to my 12mini all of yesterday just to get my work done. Figured out if I set it to LTE only restricted 5G I could stop this problem but I paid for a phone with 5G, what's up with this? Is anyone else experiencing this problem?

S22 ultra slower compressor to s21+?	My wifey got S22 ultra and transferred all content from S21+.. she is been complaining taht s22 ultra is slow compared to s21… I’ve never used Samsung but anyone experienced this issue ? or discussed anywhere else? ..	R
Can future updates fix the battery drain issue?	"I purchased my base S22 three weeks ago and I'm still experiencing significant battery drain. I end up needing to charge my phone 2 or 3 times a day with moderate usage. The phone heats up just scrolling through twitter or YouTube. I tried cleaning the cache and installing Samsung Guardians. I even took it to the Samsung service center and they said it's not defective.
I keep hearing about this mythical battery optimization and learning usage patterns, but I'm worried this is as good as it's going to get. I get about anywhere between 3-5 hours SOT with battery saver mode and even with Bixby routines it still drains about 1% an hour overnight.
tl;dr - is there any hope that this issue can be fixed through updates or is this it?
Phone is a base s22 SD variant.
edit: of course I would return it for another phone if I could, but it's too late now"	R

Does fingerprint scanning on S22U become worse after Whitedome Screen Protector installation?	Ever since I installed my screen protector, I have found my fingerprint scanning to unlock the phone becoming very frustrating to use. It's either "press hard", "cover entire scanner", or it doesn't recognize the fingerprint. I've made changes to toggle the screen touch sensitivity as well has deleted and reassigned fingerprints, and yet it's still frustrating. My wife's Pixel 6 does a better job at this point, for as much as tech reviewers whined about the P6 fingerprint scanner. Any other setting I should be looking at? Thanks.	R

FTP Transferred MP3s not Showing Up in Library Unless Manually Opened from Files App	"Hi,
Not sure if I should post this in an Android subreddit or this... I never really know because Samsung has a slightly different UI, right?
So I got my S22 Ultra, love it, but wanted to transfer some MP3s to it to use as background music for video editing.  Unfortunately, after I transfer the MP3s wirelessly via FTP, they aren't located.  I ended up downloading the Samsung Music app to test (apparently there is no music player loaded by default anymore since everyone streams now?)  I haven't transferred MP3s in ages cause I mostly use Spotify, save for a few metal albums that aren't on there. I'm saving it to the Internal Storage\\Music folder, but it doesn't matter, I tested in Downloads as well but doesn't work.
Here are some oddities:
1. If  I open the MP3 from the Files App with Samsung Music or Spotify, that MP3 will get recognized in the library afterwards.
2. I had smart switched as I was previously on an iPhone, and the local Mp3s that were on the iphone DO get recognized.  They are in the folder Internal Storage\\iPhone Data\\Music
UPDATE: I just tested transferring via USB, and it worked just fine.  I had used FTP in the beginning caues I didn't have a cable handy, and FTP was the quickest way I could think of (for some reason there's no easy Wifi transfer solution on Android that doesn't involve getting a third party app... if there is, let me know)"	R

Warped/dented screen only on right side. Normal?	"I just received my s22 ultra and noticed that the screen on the right side is slightly ""warped"" almost like it was pushed in along the entire right side top to bottom.  It is right before the curve starts.  It is very visible when the screen is off and you look at reflections on the phone as they make a ""V"" shape around it.  The left side is fine and has no problems.  
I removed the factory film from the screen and the phone has never been used yet, it's fresh out of the box brand new.
I wanted to check if this is normal before I even set up the phone.  Does anyone have a similar effect on their right side of their screen?"	R

S22 Ultra Refresh Rate/Poor Audio Output	The refresh rate on my phone will intermittently drop when scrolling through IG. I switch apps and the entire phone's refresh rate drops below 60hz. I understand it's a variable refresh rate but under these circumstances it should not drop. I have to clear all my apps before it fixes itself. **bleep** Samsung. Such an expensive phone with so many bugs. And don't get me started on the lackluster audio output both on Bluetooth and the speakers! Smh	R
Galaxy S22 Ultra USB problems	Recently received the Galaxy S22 Ultra and the problems I have had with USB connections is insane. The only cord that seems to have any luck on my PC or in my car with AA is a 2 inch pigtail. If I use any other cable it starts cycling connected/disconnected until I disconnect it. I started to notice some issues on my old device a Galaxy Note 10+ 5G when it upgraded to Android 12 however this phone took it to a whole new level. There seems to be only one or two cables that actually work for AA or connecting to a computer. It is almost like the device is not getting enough power for it to negotiate a connection. Either the phone is not accepting the connection it is being given or the hardware is not sufficient enough to utilize older USB technology and only wants USB C 3.2 connections. Of which I do not have access to a computer or car that utilizes that standard.Is anyone else experiencing this? Is this a Samsung issue or is it a Android OS issue? Firmware or hardware? There has to be more to this then what I am seeing. I have requested to exchange the phone incase it is something to do with a bad device and I hope that is all this is.	R

Firmware update.	Last year my Samsung Galaxy S21 had a firmware update that I thought was absolute trash. It made apps crash that before hand I never had a problem with, it added absolutely ridiculous features such as missed phone calls, phone screen turns on, missed alarm, phone screen turns on, plug phone in to charge, phone screen turns on...you get my point. I ended up having to return the device as it was deemed defective. In January 2022, my Samsung Galaxy S10 that I've had since 2019 (and loved) ended up having the same firmware update and the same problems. At least with my S10, customer support was able to fix the apps crashing problem I encountered, not the screen turning on problem. Now I have the S22 and I'm having the same problem with the screen turning itself on if there's a missed phone call, missed alarm, hitting snooze on the alarm, or plugging in or unplugging the device. Is there a setting that I'm just unaware of or can Samsung implement a new firmware rectifying this problem so I don't accidentally call someone from my pocket when this happens? Thank you!	R
Android System Update, turn off automatic download	While at work last wk my pants pocket (phone pocket) became incredibly warm. Thought I was imagining it, but when I grabbed my S22 Ultra a minute later it was very warm. I found that it was downloading the first major software update. I figure the warmth was from being in my pocket + the case I have on it + downloading over 5G with a weak signal (not good in my workplace). I would never download a system update unless I was at home on Wi-Fi - I know Android software updates don't count against data for us non-unlimited data dummies, but I do prefer to have the phone in open space and charging while downloading/installing a big update. So may as well use Wi-Fi lol. My question: how do I turn off the auto-download for Android system/software updates? I'd prefer just a notice of availability so I can manually start the download later.	R
Only one bar on S22 Ultra?	I have read a few comments about one or two bar issues with the S22 Ultra, is this a phone issue? Any resolution? I know it's not my service as I have a Moto 5G Stylus I use for business and that has 4 to 5 bars at all times. I did just switch providers and couldn't bring my old Note 8 which always had 5 bars. Now this S22 Ultra never has more than 2 bars!! I work from home and haven't fully transitioned to my business line, so having this phone work is imperative. Should I return it? And are all the 22s this way or just the Ultra? Help!	R

Battery percentage always at 0%	Hello All,I've had my Pre-Ordered Galaxy S22 Ultra for Several Weeks now and since the first day, it has never shown anything but 0% for the battery life in the upper right corner.To see what my battery life is currently at I have to either plug in the charger or go in the settings to see the battery health.I read somewhere it had to do with the battery not being configured correctly and i did the whole let it die and charge it to 100% then turn it on method still nothing.	R
S22 Ultra 8GB/156 LAGGY	My s22u is very laggy. I see it alot when opening apps and sometimes the typing will not keep up with me. I am only 7 days in so I can return it but how disappointing from the new chipset. This thing should be smooth as glass. I am guessing there is not enough RAM to run things sufficiently. With other manufacturers having smooth devices out the 8/128, I am wondering if it has anything to do with the Note side of the software. Just spit balling. Very upsetting. I will try the higher RAM version if I can get one.	R
Can't hear notifications when phone is on lock screen	"I have a new Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra and I'm having trouble with sound notifications when the phone is on the lock screen. 
I've gone through multiple troubleshooting tips, including making sure the individual apps I want to hear notifications from are enabled. 
I have a particular app that notifies me when I need to do things periodically throughout the day. I know approximately when I should get the notification. What's weird is that the notification sound works when I exit the lock screen to look at the main display. So I know the notification is being sent, but it isn't displaying or sounding on the lock screen. 
I'm running the latest update of Android ver 12. 
FWIW, this problematic app worked fine on the Galaxy 10+ that I upgraded from. I'm sure that it is set up correctly."	R
Recent Apps Button Only Showing Samsung Apps	"Anyone notice after the March (AVC8) update that the lower left button no longer works for multiasking?

No Network after update.	S22+ on Verizon (Locked). I’ve had the phone since launch with no major issues. I received the March update on Friday the 18th. Since then, I have lost my network at least once every day. I get the message “Your phone’s not registered on a network so you can only make emergency calls.” Restarting or toggling Airplane mode on and off will correct it temporarily. I’ve gone into Settings>General Management>Reset, and reset the network settings, but that hasn’t corrected the problem. Anyone else with this issue? What else can I try?	R
S22 ultra unlocked wifi issues.	"Let me start by saying it's brand new. Like I just opened it. Ordered red and it took awhile.  
So as I sit here the wifi keeps loosing the internet. Stays connected to wifi, just the internet goes.  
I notice it while using of course but also because I I switch and transfer and get things up to speed, my note10+ is right next to me. It no longer has a sim card, but wifi is connected. It gets notifications and when I look and big red, it's got the exclamation point next to wifi.  
I am patient and usually I know it takes a few days and cycles to balance it all out.

S22u bluetooth issues with _ phone-car-watch	"I am still in the updating and settling the phone, I just got it yesterday. Originally it was having wifi and 5g shutting off and on, but that seems to have settled.  
So this morning I get in my car for the first time and attempt to play audio. I have a 2013 honda pilot, all paired up and ready to go, but the audio was choppy. Either not playing or eventually I could get a quick blip. Like it was trying to peak thru. My first thought was interference. Figured maybe something in the garage was messing with it. As I drove away, nothing changed. I tried turning bt off and on, unpairing and repairing and still the same results.  
At 1 point when looking at my galaxy watch 3, I noticed the screen didn't display the musical note. I shut the watch off and the car began playing the music no issues. I shut off, and rebooted all items and again same issues. I shut the watch off and back again.  
I will attempt to forget and relearn the watch to phone pairing and check back, but anyone else have phone to watch to 3rd device issues? Btw no issues with my note10+."	R
Issues with random mobile network disconnect	Anyone getting random disconnects with mobile network? I'm on an unlocked S22U with T-Mobile, and I will randomly have my phone completely disconnect from mobile network (shows the circle with the line through it instead of mobile network in notification bar). A small popup shows up that says please insert sim card or something. Sim card is brand new (got it for the s22U). Data is also incredibly slow at times, like 2Mb/s.	R

Poor FPS for anyone else?	"I just got my S22 Ultra (lowest spec 128 GB) this past Sunday. Upgrading from my S10 I've loved this phone these past few days. I've adopted the larger form-factor faster than anticipated, I absolutely ADORE the Spen, and have had a blast wondering through town with the fantastic camera. However, I've also noticed some pretty severe frame-drops during usage, sometimes outright freezing for the better part of a second. It seems to happen the most consistently when switching between apps, and occasionally when 'handwriting' with the Spen. It never lasts longer than like a second, and some may not think it warrants complaining, but I've never had a phone stutter so heavily for seemingly no reason. ESPECIALLY a phone as new and high-end as the S22 Ultra. I hope you're all enjoying your phones, and haven't encountered this. But, if you have,  is there a fix? Or are we likely just waiting for Samsung to address the issue? This is my first time getting a 'top-of-the-line' phone, and it sucks that $1200 has resulted in an (at times) more distracting experience than my old phone's.

Weird WhatsApp notifications on my new S22 Ultra	"I just got my S22 Ultra and noticed my WhatsApp notifications are different.

I see lots of posts about battery life, but I have a big issue with the last 5%.	"The battery works okay for me, but when it gets down to the last 5%, I have like 2 minutes of use before it dies. That's insane. My old galaxies could be used for like 20 minutes on 5%. It's almost like they wanted the normal battery life to *seem*  longer, so they manipulated it so the last 5% exhausts far faster, and way more disproportionately than the rest. People actually need a reliable notice of when they're that low. What if I'm driving somewhere new and I'm following maps? Or out of town or something? People need notice when they're that low, and have some time to finish what they were doing and get to a charge location; not 'oh hey, your battery is low... *and I'm shutting down*."" 
They could fix this with an update. They need to do that shit ASAP."	R
Screen keeps waking up while charging	"My S22+ screen keeps waking up and showing the charging animation while super fast charging. Using a 45W official Samsung charger and the cable that came in the box, it's too much that I'm forced to switch off the phone. It's so often that if the phone is unlocked it'll never lock, as soon as it dims, it lights itself up again.

To be clear both these headset use a usb C dongle to use 2.4ghz for low latency audio. Trying to figure out if its a issue with my specific s22 ultra or a firmware issue will all s22 phones. Any help or input would be amazing. Thanks.	R
S22 Display Glitch - it's not just the Ultras	"[Video](https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/691609871)
Here I'm using Tasker, and whenever I open a context menu I see this small display glitch.
Googled a bit and apparently only S22 Ultra owners have reported somthing similar while watching videos. However it's not limited to Ultras, or to video playback.
I'm also experiencing the glitch with KLWP. Whenever I update the live wallpaper I get full screen glitches for 5-10 seconds before it normalizes. I thought it was an issue with KLWP at first, until I saw it in Tasker as well.
Does this mean I need to send my phone back? I'm afraid they'll cancel my freebie galaxy watch if I do that.
EDIT: Screen recorder doesn't pick up the glitches, which makes me think it's a hardware issue."	R

Phone being warm when it's just idle and when doing light browsing. Not sure what the cause is.	"Ive had this s22 ultra (US Unlocked Snapdragon) for about a month now and this has never happened to me. This morning I noticed across from the camera on the top left corner of my phone, it is getting super hot like intensive games hot but I was only doing casual reddit browsing. I give my phone a reboot and afterward while it doesn't get as hot, the top left corner is still warmer than usual while in casual use. Later in the day, I plug it in and when I check on it at 100 percent, the top left corner is warm when the phone usually is cold to the touch.
I have no idea what the cause of this is as it has never happened to me. I'm not sure if it's a rogue app causing this or if it has something to do with the software update I got on Monday.
Anyone experienced this before?
Edit: it's fine when idle and not plugged in. I'm still not sure why it was warm when plugged in earlier."	R

Reddish/pinkish screen on Galaxy S22 Ultra when tilted	"I bought a Galaxy S22 Ultra and noticed that when I tilt it from the bottom, if there is an image, the screen tends to be reddish/pinkish. 
I am familiar with amoled screens and I know that if you tilt the phone from top to bottom it tends to green, but from bottom to top I've never seen a screen that turned red. It is very annoying. 
I have compared it with the Galaxy S22+ and Galaxy S21+ of friends but I have not noticed this problem. 
I went to a shop today and compared it to the exposed Galaxy S22 Ultra and it had the same problem. 
I am undecided whether to replace it, I don't want to be without a phone for 1 week, Has anyone else noticed similar problems?

well, a number more weeks have gone by now and i still have nothing. 
there is no way for me to update my Google Messages app IF they don't push it to me.

After charging to 100%, does your S22 Ultra almost immediately drop to 99% after removing from charger?	Basically, asking what the title says. After you charge to 100% and then remove from the charger, does your S22 Ultra drop almost immediately to 99% or soon thereafter? My S22 Ultra came a week ago last Tuesday. So only about eight days old. The battery life of my S22 Ultra seems on par with my almost three year old Note 10+. Thanks!	R
sudden overnight battery drain?	"Hi everyone. Wanted to hear other people's thoughts on this.
Have been enjoying this phone tremendously over the past couple of days and experiencing negligible battery drain overnight. Then I wake up today morning and notice that i've lost nearly 20% of my battery overnight. I havent changed any settings nor the way i'm using the phone so I'm trying to figure out what happened.
https://imgur.com/a/Qnt194O
I've uploaded battery use from yesterday and what i've got so far today and the difference between 12am and 8am yesterday and today is plain to see. The only apps that have been active during these hours are google play services, finder and samsung health, and all for less than a minute. So i don't understand how something like this happens.
It has happened just this one time do i dont know if the same thing will happen tonight but wanted to hear from others. I'm from South East Asia so i believe i've got the model running on the Snapdragon.
Cheers!"	R

We need to admit it. battery life is not good for S22 series.	"I switched from iPhone 12 mini to s22u. I may only get slightly better battery life. SOT around 6-7hours at most compared with 5 hours for the mini. I don't think that is a good result with 5000mha battery. My wife's iPhone 13 is even better stable at 8 hours of sot. I still like this phone especially the camera system. 
I had the last year's s21 plus but not satisfied with its battery. That is why I switched to iPhone. 
I am more worried about the future of android flagship, or snapdragon SoC. It is just so much worse than A14 and A15 in terms of about everything. 
Hope this will improve when the snapdragon SoC is TSMC made the next year."	R

Facebook Messenger Chat Bubbles bug	"Are other people experiencing this issue? When a Facebook Messenger Chat bubble pops up, the entire screen becomes unresponsive for about 2-3 seconds.
It's super annoying. Was apparently an [issue with S21 and other Samsung phones since One UI 4.0](https://reddit.com/r/S21Ultra/comments/reff1w/very_annoying_bug_when_using_facebook_messenger/). I use Nova launcher but apparently it's the same on stock.
Anyone experiencing the same have a fix?"	R
Constant Wifi issues	"I am having constant wifi troubles that are making this phone unusable. I'm connected to my home network, (with no error message, exclamation points, etc) while the connection will slow to an absolute crawl, or just straight up not load anything at all. When I turn wifi off and back on, the issue is solved for all of about 30 seconds before its back to being slow as hell. I have reset my router (standard xfinity router), I have restarted my phone, and I have turned off hotspot 2.0.
I have no idea what to do. I had this same issue with my galaxy s10, however it was much less frequent. It's extremely frustrating that a brand new phone out of the box has this consistent of an issue with something as basic as wifi. 
This is not an issue with my internet (250Mb/s down). All my other devices never have this issue. It has only happened with my Galaxy phones. This one especially.
Does anyone have the same issue, or a fix?"	R
Galaxy Store Update list issue	"Anyone else having their Galaxy Store update list show apps that doesnt need updates?
Ie. Bank of America.
Galaxy Store shows there's a update for it. Google Store doesnt.
Update via Galaxy Store. Now Google Store shows there's a update. Update via Google Store. Both doesnt show any more update for it.

Scrolling feels too sensitive when I release my finger from the screen?	"When I release my finger from the screen at the end of a scroll gesture, the screen often continues to scroll in unpredictable ways. This is because the screen is responding to subtle movements of my finger as I release it.
Is anyone else struggling with this? The scrolling just doesn't feel right. (I'm coming from a Galaxy Note 9, which has a very different scroll feel compared to the S22. Maybe I just need to get used to it?)"	R
S22 ultra not recognized by PC	I'm not sure if anyone else is having this issue but anytime I connect my phone to a PC through a USB cable it is never recognized. Is this a software issue that Samsung is working on updating or do I have a defective phone that needs to be returned?	R
Gap between display and frame	"Hello everyone,
My S22 arrived yesterday. I noticed a gap between the display and the frame to the left and right of the earpiece. It's not a big deal, but in bright light you can see a bit inside (see the brightly lit gap in my photos) and you can even fit a sheet of paper in there. Does anyone else have this or should the gap not be so wide?
Thanks in advance.

Messages Sending as Blank Bubbles	"I've been using the Google Messages app on my new S22 Ultra with Google Fi for a couple of days now, but just today, most of my Messages have been sending through as blank messages to my contacts with iPhones.  I'm not sure if this case is the same for android to android messages, because I haven't tried to message a contact with an android yet. 
I've been reading about the issues with the newly released RCS,  but I can't find any solutions for this specific problem. I've tried disabling chat features, clearing cache, resetting my phone, etc.
I'm not sure if this issue is specific to Google Messages, because I tried Samsung's messages and I think the problem may still exist with that app.
Has anyone had a similar problem? Does anyone know of a solution?"	R
Memory usage too high on SD S22+	"Several weeks ago I posted a complaint about phone's lag and stutter issues. Turns out it did not get better after the March update. In fact, I think sometimes it's worse now. There are quite a few times the phone becomes laggy for all operations and almost unusable.
I looked into the usual suspects and felt the available memory on my phone might be way too low. Before I cleaned it only had about 1.5GB. What are typical available memory for other S22+ users?
I am not sure if factory resetting could address the issue, as I'd still have to use smart switch. What are some good ways to check what's causing my memory to run low and fix it?

WiFi hotspot discharging faster than the charging - is it normal?	Does anyone have any experience with this? It seems strange to me. But I came from OnePlus 8T, which has a really fast charging, so I might be biased by this fact.	R
Starred messages don't save on s22+	I am on my 2nd S22 plus plus because starred messages do not save like they are supposed to when you lock them. I have spent literally hours and hours with Samsung IT trying to help and keep getting told they don't know why and it is some kind of glitch in the system of the phone. This is absolutely not OK and I need that feature as I work a 100% remote and an extensive amount of my time is texting professional links etc. I often have hundreds of communications a day via text and need to be able to delete unnecessary info but save starred texts. The 1st s22+ kept also crashing every time I tried to open and user apps. I just don't understand how Samsung always upgrades but those constantly glitches with the phone I have had about 6 or 7 back-to-back Samsung phones that just don't work I just went 27 days without a working phone because I went through 4 before they sent me one that actually seems to work but now I'm still having this text to star issue. Samsung it keeps shrugging their shoulders telling me they don't know what to tell me and even factory reset my phone losing EVERYTHING I had when they remotely plugged in. So sick of Samsung	R
S22 ultra battery issues	Ever since I downloaded the new March update my battery life has been horrible. Anyone else having this issue. ? Before the update I was getting well over 11 hours of battery life and it took a long time for it to drain, since the update its down to 30% after 7 hrs. That's absolutely horrible for a new phone	R
Worse battery backup	I bought Samsung S22 and have been using it since 3 weeks. I must say that S22 has poor battery performance. I did not expect such less battery backup. Previously I used Samsung S10+ which had good battery backup. Now I repent giving up my old phone. Can Samsung do anything to improve S22 battery performance. I am quite disappointed by S22.	R
0.6x Camera Failed sometimes?	My 0.6x camera fails but it does it sometimes, it does it in safemode and the diagnostic menu too but it works most of the time. I've also cleared the cache and it'll work fine for a little bit and then it'll fail again. The only thing I haven't done is factory reset the phone. But I'm thinking it may be a software issue because it works fine most of the time. Does it happen to anyone else?	R
Photo Gallery all Jumbled in Instagram/Facebook	I just upgraded from Galaxy S8 to Galaxy S22 and now my photo gallery is all jumbled up in Instagram and Facebook when I try to select a photo to post. The camera gallery is ok thankfully. Has anyone else had this issue and how did you get it fixed? I can't find any resources for help on this. It's so frustrating.	R
Samsung Themes not working properly on S22 Plus and Ultra	Got my new phones and went to apply galaxy themes and the s22 plus doesn't show backgrounds on messages (tried light and dark mode) . Went on the S22 Ultra and downloaded a new theme and got message saying due to software it might not fully function on the new phone. Any ideas why the themes wouldn't be for the phones we are downloading to and not function correctly?	R
S22 ultra	Anyone know how to prolong the battery life of this phone? My screen time on is around 40 mins and I'm already down to 83%, I've watched a ton of videos and have done everythingni can to help extend its life a bit longer but nothing seems to help. I've had the phone for almost 2 weeks now and it's not a huge problem, I'm just curious. My last phone was the LG V60 thinQ and it's battery life was phenomenal so this will take some getting used to. Again, I was just curious if anyone out there had any pointers I may have missed, thanks.	R
Galaxy s22 ultra no visual voicemail	I have a Galaxy s22 ultra and I cannot get the visual voicemail to work. Everytime I open the app, it acts like it is starting up brand new and has me accept the terms. Then takes me into the app and says no new voicemails, but there is new voicemails. Ive tried clearing the data for the app and clearing the app cash and still no avail. Anybody got a solve to this.	R
Facebook Story does not post	I've seen some threads about this issue already and just want to confirm it too that both mine and my wife's S22 Ultras have the same issues with posting to our FB stories. Music and tags post, but the pictures are always blank. It seems consistent to an issue with the S22 Ultra. We definitely need a patch to fix this issue. It doesn't seem to be an issue with FB. I've tested multiple scenarios already.	R
Vibration Patterns (After March Update)	S22 Ultra (S908U) After March update vibration patterns 1-13 do not work or are so faint they might as well not work. Diagnostic fails in Members Diagnostic but Android sensors test it actually works and is quite powerful. This leads me to believe it is strictly software issues (like most other issues since phone released) it works with dubstep or any pattern after that but is still far fainter than it should be.Touch feedback vibration patterns can't be changed so those likely won't work at all but I don't use them so I can't say for certain.Full wipe and Reflash OS update doesn't resolve anything.	R
Youtube videos play no pictures	Why does my S22 Ultra play youtube videos with just sound and no videos?? Is it due to a setting that I can change???	R
WiFi Connection	I have a Samsung S22 Ultra and it has major issues connecting to WiFi. I have put it in airplane mode, I have forgot then reconnected, i have reset my internet and nothing seems to work. Is there any fix for this issue?	R
Camera won't auto-rotate	Just today my camera refuses to auto-rotate and it only takes pictures in portrait, I looked into the settings to see if there's something I could do but didn't find anything. Edit for clarification: When I do take a pic while holding the phone horizontal it still takes a pic in portrait as if I'm holding it vertically.	R
COD pixelates on S22 Ultra	The game plays normally, but the graphics are off and mountains in the background pixelate heavily. No problems on any other apps. Tried all settings, cleared cashe, reinstalled, everything.	R
S22 Ultra - 10MP (3x optical) lens showing thin lines in pictures	Just got the phone and I've been enjoying it. I started playing with night mode and the different camera options but kept noticing that when I switched to the 3x lens I kept getting these thin lines on the viewfinder and on the pictures I was taking.All the other lenses seem to be fine.I tried resetting the camera settings and clearing cache but it's still there.Anyone know of a fix or have the same issue?

S22 Series Battery Drain is its Achilles Heel!	After reading a geek article which showed real life of 5.5 hours for the S22 battery, I cancelled a pending order and bought the S22+ with its bigger battery. I paid $1000 USD for my S22+ with a 4500 mAH battery.For comparison, my Pixel 6 cost only $600 and had a 4500 mAH battery. It always lasted 2 days on Wifi at home for normal web surfing usage.Not the S22+!! Even after waiting for optimization, it has never hit 2 days.I am SO disappointed with the S22+ battery.How did this ever get past Samsung Hardware Dev QC Dept? It's so obviously subpar! $1000 for a subpar battery system! $200 more than the S22. $400 more than the Pixel 6!I am so **bleep** at Samsung for going CHEAP on the battery. SHAME on Samsung Galaxy Dev Group!You turned a beautiful phone into a cheap toy. Hundreds of complaints here, on Reddit, on Facebook. And after the March update, my phone has to re-optimize the battery all over again? Why?SAMSUNG - FIX THIS BATTERY PROBLEM OR RECALL THESE BATTERIES! YOU KNOW THIS BATTERY SYSTEM IS FUBAR! MAKE IT RIGHT. EXTEND THE RETURN PERIOD TO 45 DAYS AND I'LL SEND MINE BACK.DISGUSTED. I'm out $1000 for a subpar phone.	R
Recommended apps	After this last update of my S22, my recommended apps will only display samsung apps. It's very annoying and makes no sense that it doesn't suggest the apps that I use most. Is there a way to fix this or did Samsung screw up?	R
S22 Ultra Display brightness is dim	So I got my S22 Ultra today but I'm noticing that the brightness is significantly dimmer than my Note 20 Ultra. Has anybody else seen this or know what's going on? It gets brighter if I switch it to Natural instead of Vivid but my Note 20 Ultra is on Vivid as well. I almost couldn't see the display when I was outside earlier even	R
S22 ultra camera glitching	Has anyone had their 100mp camera not focus at all on subjects I have a video but nowhere to post it on here	R
Bluetooth to car stereo	So my phone after the update is not playing anything on car stereo Bluetooth. Its connected and everything but when it comes to playing audio/music it doesn't play nothing. Car/stereo controls still works and answering phone calls.	R
Split window not working	If I try to put an app (from recent apps screen) in split window, nothing happens: the option is there, but clicking on it does nothing.Popup mode works fine.Any options I have to enable?	R
Bluetooth bug after March update	I received the latest update to my Galaxy S22 Ultra on 3-23. Today, I can now longer have an audio stream via Bluetooth to my car radio. Worked perfect prior to the update. I tried Spotify, YouTube Music, Audible and Smart Audiobook Player. I can connect to the radio and it shows track information, but no audio is heard. Pausing the track only works for a moment, then it starts playing again, with no audio. It is not a volume issue.I have rebooted the phone.I have deleted the Bluetooth pairing and paired the phone to the radio again. Same results.Ugh!Anyone else having this issue?	R
Talk to text missing	I recently updated my phone, a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra (i.e. yesterday morning) and my little microphone to use Talk to Text is gone and I have tried everything to get it back. Can't find it anywhere in settings... Google or Samsung..Any suggestions?	R
Phone not playing music in car	My Samsung S22 Ultra is connected to my Bluetooth uconnect in my car. I can talk and receive calls fine, but as soon as I try to connect to Amazon music it will play for like 5 seconds and stop. The music will continue to play on the phone with no sound on my radio. Any one has any issues with this? Or tips?	R
Can't access X-Plore Files?	I have been able to access all Android/Data files on Android 12 on my S20 just fine. Just got a S22 and can no longer access the sub-folders in any directories. Any suggestions for a non-rooted phone running Android 12 to access these folders would be greatly appreciated 👍🏻	R
No notifications from my Samsung calendar	I have just replaced my Galaxy S10+ for a S22+. Since then I'm struggling with my Samsung Calendar. The old events are fine, but not the new ones, because now, when I add a new event and click in CUSTOM, I don't have the option ALERT TYPE (Notification or Email) anymore (and I need to be notified BY EMAIL.) I have been running some tests, even in Google Calendar, and there's no way to receive a notification by email, or any notification at all! I tried everything, but I can't find a solution for that and I would really appreciate your help. Thanks in advance!	R
Email sync issues	Hello, I recently upgraded from the S10+ to the S22 Ultra. Everything is great except my emails using the Gmail app only appear when I go into the app and Swipe down. I have checked all the settings in Gmail and sync is turned on. On the S10+ I believe it used to check for emails every 15 minutes. I have no idea what could be wrong. Thanks for all the help.	R
Recent Apps Settings	When swiping up for recent apps, I noticed the four apps at the bottom no longer show my most used apps. It only shows the calendar, calculator, gallery, and settings. How do I change it back? I tapped the three dots at top right but it only gives option to select show recommended apps. Even with that selected, the four apps on the bottom doesn't change. Is this due to the recent March security update?	R
Homescreen icons moving position	Long time Android user and I've never experienced this. My homescreen icons won't stay in the order I place them in, even the ones in folders. It's not all of them, just a few. Has anyone seen this as well?	R
Audio seems to be playing up sporadically, volume up and down making no difference as no sound, reboot and back to normal.		R
Home WiFi Bixby Routine Not Consistent	Has anyone else had an issue with the Bixby routine trigger for connecting to a specific WiFi network? I use the "turn on wifi automatically" setting, and I have a Bixby routine to keep my phone unlocked when connected to my home wifi. When I get home, my wifi turns on and my phone reconnects to my home wifi, but the Bixby routine doesn't activate unless I disable and re-enable it. Then my phone stays unlocked like it's supposed to. I'm not sure what could be the issue.	R
Anyone else having trouble posting photos in Facebook Stories? Have trier a different couple times and just a black screen appears..		R
I am incredibly disappointed with this. 6th day of usage... Happy with the phone overall but this is kind of ridiculous. I set up with Smart Switch (apps, settings, gallery), but I don't fully understand why that would be the reason. Any tips?		R
S22 Ultra - recorded video problem - pixelated line	"Hello, 
Recently got 2 S22 Ultra's, and one of them has this problem.  
Every time I record video there is pixelated line going on the the video.
While recording or taking pictures, everything is good, so I guess camera is ok?  
After I'm watching that video, there is pixelated line.
also when you send video to someone, it's same

I broke the voice for maps and Google assistant..	"I downloaded a free text-to-speech app and was playing around with the different voices, I have since uninstalled the app but the voices still stick for applications like Google maps and assistant answering back. 
I checked all the language settings and everything is in default.. all the voices etc, but cannot get the default Google voice back. Any ideas?"	R
Camera issue	"Hi guys I noticed a strange behavior with the camera.
I wanted to take a picture of a friend while she was jumping.
I took the picture, opened the gallery app and in the photo she was jumping, exactly as I wanted, but in the bottom of the screen I had a little loading bar and after a couple of seconds it changed and she was standing on the ground.
I think it is some kind of optimization and the S22 takes some photos then merges them/chooses the best one.
I noticed these behavior in other shoots also, is really annoying when there are people moving
Do you know how can I choose which photo to keep or disable this?"	R
One UI 4.1 - Expanded Quick Panel and Multi SIM Info (Feedback)	"Hello,
Why is the Expanded Quick Panel Buttons shrinks down to 4x2 When (Multi SIM Info) is shown! There is a big empty space above. Please let us show Multi SIM Info and the full 4x3 Buttons in Expanded Quick Panel and Media Control all together. (Multi SIM Info) is very helpful for changing the Data SIM very fast without going to the settings.

Bluetooth issues	Just want to know if anyone else has the same issue, I updated my s22 ultra last night and now the Bluetooth on my car is really choppy like it's not connected properly. I tried another phone and it works fine so I know it's not my car. This only started happening since I updated yesterday.	R
S22 Ultra Unlocked Verizon issues.	Got my s22 ultra on Wednesday it keeps randomly disconnecting from cellular. Im on verizon and its an unlocked model. Already had verizon change the sim card. Any other ideas?	R
A little bug on my s22	So I have a small bug involving the notification panel. Basically when I try to scroll down in the notification panel it glitches to the bottom and when I scroll back up it glitches all the way back to the top of the notification panel. The only way to make the notification panel go back to normal is if I tap the expand button on a notification, then I can scroll without it glitching. I'm running the latest version of oneui at the time of this post.	R
Edge Panel Responsiveness	Has anyone else had issues with activating the edge panel? I used it for years on my S10 and it was a very consistent experience. In the S22, base model, no screen protector, no case (feel free to judge but the issue isn't with hitting the edge of the case) it rarely works on the first attempt even if I hit the handle the first time. Let me know if anyone else has noticed this.	R
Galaxy S22 Is KillingMy Health App	"I wear a sensor that measures my blood sugar at all times. This sensor sends its data via Bluetooth to an app on my phone and alerts me when the measurements get out of range. At least it did on my Galaxy S8.
But now, it seems the background service that should alert me gets killed almost immediately after I go to sleep, which means no alarm for me, which is very unhealthy and can even be dangerous. I used Don't Kill My App to adjust every battery setting I found to turn off this behavior, without success.  Samsung just does it anyway. I find it especially infuriating since there's no need for battery optimization at night when my phone is plugged in. 
Does anybody else experience this problem? Did you solve it?
I cannot live with a phone that does not respect my settings."	R
let's stop kidding ourselves, battery life on S22 is horrendous.	"Got this phone on Monday, moved everything over via smart switch.  For the next 3 days battery life was beyond abysmal but under battery it said it was still learning usage patterns so I said ""I'll let it learn and see what happens""
Day 4 rolls around and battery life got marginally better, I could go to one hour before bedtime before charging unlike being dead before work was over at 5.
Now this weekend was the real test of all day off and on use.  Did a little Google maps navigating and other typical weekend stuff.  I was to 20% by 2p.  
Google play services in particular is DESTROYING my battery life.  It shows to be active for less than 1 min but consumes up to 8% of battery.
I understand the battery is slightly smaller than my S20 I traded this in for, but I would also expect newer CPU optimizations to offset this.  That is not the case.
Bottom line Samsung has rolled out a real stinker and this is NOT an upgrade!"	R
I'm at the verge of throwing my phone into a well. it lags and stutter like crazy. and don't let me begin with how bad snapchat is. is this a flagship phone? i had better luck with xiaomi than Samsung 🙄		R

Google profile showing in text message?	So, I gave a friend my number and when she looked at my contact on her phone, it had my google profile photo... how did that happen? I thought texting was through my provider and not through google?	R
Smart Alert	Anyone having issues with smart alert? Usually Samsungs vibrate when picked up if you have missed calls/texts but mine isn't doing that. I checked my Motions&amp;Gestures settings and it's all correct. Any advice? Thanks 🙂	R
Timers, Alarms, and A Phone that Can't Keep Time	"Hello! I've had my S22 Ultra for a few weeks now, and there have been a few hiccups, the first of which I'm looking to see if others are also experiencing.
Using the default Clock app, I've had many instances of timers simply not going off -- I'd often walk back over to my phone to see the screen showing ""-1:50:23"" or some other ridiculously over-time reading that had long since elapsed. And in every case, the phone remained completely silent. After each case, I double-checked the volume settings, and every channel, from Media to Ringtone to System, was at maximum volume. 
Upon further testing, it seems like the ringtone would go off for exactly five minutes, then continue to count up in silence, rendering the functionality quite literally useless to me. There have been countless times where I'll set a timer, walk away for even just 6 minutes, and come back with my phone face down, having zero indication that anything is amiss while it happily counts up.
I checked the configuration in the Clock app, and there doesn't seem to be a way to alter this behavior, which means I need to find another app to use instead. That wouldn't be a problem if the battery optimizations on the S22 weren't so aggressive that the Google Clock app is unable to function at all. Timers longer than 2 minutes don't go off until the phone is unlocked, once again rendering the functionality useless. Currently checking to see if this occurs even with battery optimizations disabled in Settings.
Needless to say, coming from another phone where basic clock functionality ""just worked"", it would be nice to see the same on this phone. if I set a timer, and that timer has hit zero, the phone should be beeping and vibrating until the battery's empty. Either that, or let me adjust or disable how long after the deadline the timer stops ringing -- 5 minutes is ridiculously short. 20 minutes, an hour, even two hours, is more like it.
Anyway. Got kinda ranty towards the end of this, but I'd love to hear if anybody else is experiencing similar issues. Thanks!"	R
What is Mobile Network Diagnostics and why is it wasting so much battery?		R
Speakers needed to be replaced	By the way everyone--I took my phone to samsung today--I speaker/diagnostic test was done and the transformer was broken--right out of the box!! No update will fix broken. If the speakers do not sound right to you, and you have a samsung store nearby--get it checked or just return. From all of these threads, I think tons of S22U Faulty devices were shipped, but hopefully I am incorrect. I want to THANK everyone on this thread for sharing knowledge and support. VERY VERY VERY VERY much appreciated!	R
March 22 Update Camera Issues	Immediately after the March 22 update I took some pictures of family. The Camera is now distorting the shape of the face and head. It has stretched them. This is very noticeable to the point it does not look like the same person. I took several pics with and without flash. They were all the same. Pics were also taken with an iPhone 8 and were normal.Pics of the same subject taken a few days ago were excellent and had no distortion. The lighting was similar.I have checked my Camera settings and my lenses are clean.The phone has not been dropped or been exposed to any harsh or humid environments.Has anyone else had this issue? Is there a fix?Thanks	R
Wifi 6E issues	I am having issues connecting with my wifi 6E network. I have a S22 Ultra and a Asus gt-axe11000 router. Sometimes the S22 ultra will connect to the wifi 6E network and stay connected, other times it won't even find the network. I've tried resetting network settings on the S22 ultra and rebooting the router. I'd rather not factory reset the router as the S22 ultra is the only device with connection issues to the router. Could anyone assist ?	R
Calaboration view issues	I can not seem to get my tablet to allow my phone to be the tool bar in samsung notes. I can see it but it will not let me toggle it. I have double checked I'm connected via Bluetooth and they see each other. Is there a fix or something I'm missing ? Phone is the s22 ultra and tablet is the ultra as well	R

S22 Ultra **bleep**	Is it just me or is there anyone else whose phone is freezing and restarting on its own? It's happened 3 times in the past hour already!! I spent way too much money ofor my phone to act this way.	R
S22 ultra over heating	S22 ultra is over heating and the battery performance is very poor not happy about it and if you put it full performance mode it will use lots off power battery will be died in 6 hours if you look at s21 ultra screen and s22 ultra screen side by s21 ultra has better colors contrast.	R
Internet Connection Issues S22 Ultra	Since my most recent system update a few days ago, I am having issues with internet connection! If I'm on wifi and then try to use cell days, it says no internet! The only fix I have found is to restart my phone!! Help!	R
Unable to access settings while in full screen YouTube video	While watching a YouTube video using the S22 Ultra in the YouTube app, I'm unable to access the settings cog wheel.I can press the settings button (to adjust quality, speed, captions), but all that shows up is a bar at the bottom of the screen. If I turn my phone back to the vertical position, I can access those settings.Anyone else having this issue?	R
Samsung keyboard Haptics Issue	I recently bought a new galaxy s22 ultra and I've been encountering this annoying issue. For some reason the keyboard haptics randomly stops working despite haptics being enabled in the keyboard settings. I always have to toggle the keyboard haptics switch to re-enable haptics, which is really inconvenient.Has anyone else encountered this?	R

Samsung s22 ultra speaker problem	Is anyone having problems with the speaker? I just got my phone and when I play music, it sounds hollow and echoes. I've tried changing the sound settings and nothing helps.	R
S22 MMS problems	So since I've gotten the S22 I can't send MMS. They queue and then fail. I can usually send old pictures from a Google folder with pictures taken on different devices. Is it possible that the picture quality of the S22 makes the image too large to be sent? I am genuinely stumped right now and I'd appreciate any help I can get on this matter. I've tried using Google messenger, samsung messenger, and verizon+. Fails on all of them.	R
Dark split screen	Lately I've been noticing that everytime I'm watching Netflix that half of the screen on the S22 ultra is darker than the other half of the screen. Anyone else has been noticing this???It's like the screen is split in two. One half is light and the other is dark.Any idea what's going on samsung??	R
Latest update causing battery drain on S22 Ultra	Experiencing some battery drain after the latest update and am needing advice on fixing the issue	R
S22 Ultra Lag issue	I got the s22 ultra (SnapDragon 512 GB Tmobile) last week but why does it lag so much? I am coming from s21 ultra which never had any lag issues but the s22 ultra lags constantly! I updated the phone to the latest version but the lag is still noticeable. Did Samsung test this phone before releasing it? Some people are suggesting to disable 5G and change motion to 60hz but why? I have the S21 Ultra and it never lags with 5g enabled running at 120hz.I also changed the ram plus to 8GB but no luck.	R
Recent 3/22 update Galaxy 22Ultra	Recent update causing my phone to not show recent apps, only shows apps used before update. And to add, Google search bar does not allow a complete word to be typed, only one letter then does a prediction glitch. I have prediction turned off. This is a extremely annoying! When will this be fixed?	R
S22 battery issue?	I upgraded from using an S21 Ultra to S22 Ultra (SM-S908U1) (Both unlocked phones but with AT&T carrier), and was expecting better battery life, but after a month I am experiencing slightly less battery life. While I understand the battery size was supposed to be the same, I also understood that there were to have been power saving improvements, so I expected better.The Settings Battery information screen says Battery capacity 5000 mAh (typical), and shows charge status, it does not actually tell me how many mAh "my" battery is, or give any indication as to its "health". I looked for such elsewhere in settings but could not find it.I then found that in the Samsung Members app (an odd place to put it) I can run a battery test which again shows: "Capacity : 5000 mAh (typical)", but does say "Life: Good". Good? Just "Good" with no indication, or chart anywhere I can find on the internet saying just what the mAh rage is for "Good".I then remember that I used to use the AccuBattery app to remind me to stop charging at 80% (Thank you Samsung for at least adding the ability to automatically stop charging my phone at 85%), reported mAh. Well, AccuBattery displayed the Design Capacity of my battery as 4,855mAh (which I understand to be the "minimum" even though typical is 5,000mAh), HOWEVER, it reports my Estimated Capacity to be ONLY 4,401mAh. By my calculations that nowhere near the "typical" and below the minimum. Maybe my battery life is no better because my new S22 Ultra has a below-spec battery?Now, while I no longer have my S21 Ultra, and I cannot say as to what this said before, as I used this app quite a bit before, I can say that the AccuBattery estimate was NOT BELOW the "designed capacity"So what I am looking for is the following:1) Does Samsung have an app that actually calculates and reports what the mAh capacity of the batter is, and if not do you know of any others besides AccuBattery that I can try2) If any of you have an S22 and also use Accubattery, can you share you estimated capacity, as if all yours are above the "designed" capacity, and mine is not then I suspect I may have a defective battery.3) Anybody else move from and S21 Ultra to an S22 Ultra, and if so, are you experiencing better, worse, or about the same battery life?Thanks,	R

R
Facebook Messenger Issue	Anyone else having an issue with Facebook messenger chat heads? after I close a chat head, my display is temporarily disabled for like 2 or 3 seconds. I think it has to do with allowing Fb Messenger to appear on top of other apps. what's even worse is just earlier it bugged out and must've glitched and it wouldn't let me interact with anything on my screen after I closed a chat head. I had to restart the phone, and go into settings and disallow Messenger from appearing on top. never had this issue on my S10 😞	R
Messenger	I can't login into my Facebook account or messenger.	R
Battery Life	Has anyone been experiencing bad battery life ? I sure was. I think ever since i went to to the recovery mode screen deleted the phones cache & repaired the apps, downloaded the battery guardian, turned off data roaming off, ive gotten better results. This all while being on adaptive mode, wqhd+, adaptive brightness off, bluetooth always on because of my watch & im pretty satisfied with the battery life now.	R

Battery life and Lag	The S22 ultra is the laggiest phone and have the worst battery life on any flagship phone it's a shame to have a $1300 phone that can't last you a day w/ moderate usage.

File Transfer Slow on Large Files	We traded in our GalaxyS7 (AT&T) phones for GalaxyS22 (AT&T) phones, and one of the things I backed up was my old phone's pictures, so I prep them for a manual transfer to the new phone, yet I ran into a quirk of the new phone. When trying to transfer large files of a certain size, the process halts, and my desktop gives me the default asterisk sound as if i can't do the thing. Sometimes if the file is a bit large but small enough, it'll go through, but if I try something like a 100MB range file, it'll outright refuse to bring it on, period. and I didnt use smart switch to transfer old phone stuff to my new phone, im more of a manual do-it-myself type of guy, so for me to see this when I really shouldnt.....puzzlingI restarted/power off'd the phone multiple times thinking that's all it needed, nope, slowdown still happens. Now it doesn't give me the slow if I download large capacity files straight from my phone, but Desktop > BIGFILE Transfer > Phone is a nono. Is this something I can fix up myself without taking it to an at&t person, or somehow factory resetting our phone, because the nearest AT&T person is next town over, and gas prices as they are, make that non-viable unless we're going shopping for supplies we can't grab in-townSolved!Go to Solution.

S22/S22+/S22 Ultra Camera Lag is Horrible!	At least a 1-1.5 secong lag time on shots is Horrible! Unacceptable.I tried several times yesterday to take a zoom shot of two hummingbirds in my backyard. 15-20X zoom.Hummingbirds were visible several times, flitting from flower to flower.Each time they were in frame, I took a shot, hoping for even one good shot.But, always a one second or longer lag before the shutter clicks.**bleep**!Not one single successful shot after 15 tries. I gave up.Samsung S22 Dev Team - FIX THIS ISSUE!!	R

Send button not responsive	I finally got my S22 Ultra a few days ago and everything is great, but I do notice that when I try to send a text, I'll have to press the send button several times (more than necessary) to send the text. I have to hit at the right spot to get it to work, any ideas why this is? am I the only one with this problem? Maybe it's still a new phone, I remember I had the same problem when I first got the Note 20. It eventually fix itself over time.	R

Battery drain impossibly quick	I know people have mentioned the phone battery is supposed to get better but this is bordering on absurd. I upgraded from s10+ to the ultra 3 days ago partly because my battery was dying so quickly and somehow this phone is worse. I am losing like 10% battery for just half an hour of screen time. I'm not even watching videos this is just for scrolling twitter or reddit. Can anyone please advise on what additional settings I can apply to help with this?	R
is anyone else having abysmal battery life issues?	I previously had an s21 ultra and it had phenomenal battery, but I've have the s22ultra for a month and it was okay, not as good. As of the new throttling update however I've been getting absolutely abysmal battery life. Down 20% in about 1.5 hours	R
smart lock not working?	I have my pins set, even put pins around my house just incase. Also the image i downloaded for always on display isnt showing either	R
S22U WiFi?	My S22u can connect to 5GHz WiFi while my 4 year old Oppo F7 can connect to the same network at a farther place. [Look at my WiFi](https://i.imgur.com/fYCBKrT.jpg). It keeps dropping from my bed while my Oppo can still pick it up when I'm outside. I noticed this too with a 2018 iPad Pro.	R
Is this only happening to me ? When I take a video on Instagram stories there is a loud tapping noise at the start (i'm not touching anything, the room is quiet). It doesn't happen on the camera app. Can someone check please ? — I'm using the Qualcomm version.		R
Can't Rotate Screen 180 Since Last Update	As the title says, the screen will no longer allow auto rotation of 180 degrees from normal. This might seem dumb, but I use g maps with my phone upside down. That way it can sit in my cup holder and the charger faces up so it doesn't break the port. Is there a way to adjust a setting or is this the same for everyone else now?	R
Google Messages on S22	Anytime I open a conversation in Google Messages, the text entry field is always selected with the "paste" dialog open. Does that happen to anyone else? Any ideas on fixes? It doesn't happen in the Samsung Messages app, just Google.	R
Weak Vibration	"I know I complained about my s21 ultra not being intense enough when in my pocket but that phone sounded like a mini earthquake on wooden or metal tables and I can hear it so easily while far from it.
My s22 ultra however??? I can't even hear it while I'm next to it on the table, I don't know the phone is vibrating until I put a finger on it. What gives?"	R
Anyone know how to fix this high battery drain from the google app?		R
Bluetooth audio in car sounds a bit distorted	When i plug in to the car via usb the audio sounds so much better but bluetooth is awful. Anyone know what's up???	R
Extra Dim Vivid vs Natural	"I usually like my phone display on Natural. While using my phone in the dark last night, I activated the ""Extra Dim"" toggle, and noticed that it worked well in some apps (like Samsung Internet), but not others (like Relay for Reddit). Found out if I switched the display mode to Vivid, everything seems to stay consistently dimmer.
Anyone else have the same results? I'm on an S22 Ultra Snapdragon. I thought it may be an app optimization issue, but the Vivid toggle has me thinking it's an issue with Natural mode."	R
nfc issues or bug?	Alright so I just upgraded from a Samsung S20 ultra and my s22 ultra is having like NFC issues, I have an nfc15 card I use as a business card and my phone won't read it but my friends phone will display my information and contact. Is there something I need to do? My s20 had no issues I tried restarting my phone and clearing cache I'm at a halt	R

Mainly battery issues?	"So it seems from this thread the S22 mainly has a battery drain issue?
Looking to upgrade my S10 since it has started to get hot and almost overheat randomly the last few weeks.
Have a deal where I can get the S22 for not much vs paying the whole cost of a S21."	R

crackling audio issue when cold out of return window	"I have the dreaded audio crackle when it's cold. Happened in as little as 50-60 degrees even, but I didn't realize the circumstances of the issue at the time and now I've passed my return window, it's easily reproducible by putting my phone in the freezer for a couple minutes. It's definitely a hardware issue, the 'workaround' is to put pressure on the speaker, this works immediately and eventually it warms back up and functions normal.
What do I do? The warranty is just sending me to a local ubreakifix. I used them once in the past for a broken screen, which they did a good job, but this is completely different and I don't trust that they would properly diagnose or repair this issue. The phone is completely unacceptable as is so I guess I have no choice but suck it up and see what they can do. 
Has anyone had experience doing warranty? Do I have other options? I don't really want to send it back to the corporate factory since then I'm stuck using a different broken phone in the meantime. I'm guessing politely bitching at the service reps won't get me very far based on other posts I've read about this issue."	R
Google Messages suddenly defaulting to "wrong" picture folder for attachments	"All of a sudden, when I go to attach an image to a text in Google Messages (the Samsung version), it is displaying my screenshot directory. I think it used to display either recent images or camera.  I think recent, though.
I've tried clearing cache on Messages, Gallery, and Photos.  I've reset defaults.  I've rebooted.
I see no way to select/designate a default directory, nor make Photos the default app.
Anyone have any ideas to help?"	R
Is anyone using air actions on the Ultra?	"I just can't get the gestures to work properly. It takes several tries, making it not worth the effort. Also the button is flat I can never tell where it is without looking at the pen. On the S21U the S Pen was bigger and more comfortable to hold, so it was easier for me to slide my finger on the sides to find the button.
Anyone got any tips? Our is this feature just a gimmick?"	R
Twitter and Other Apps Scrolling Issue	I was really hoping my first update would take care of this but I find myself looking longingly at the Note 10+ on my desk.	R
S22 Returned	So I've had to return my S22. The battery life was the straw that broke the camel's back. I loved the size and the flat flat flat screen but the Samsung bloat ware and the want of the pixel experience was calling me. I'm happy with my 6 and really wanted the s22 to draw me in. I hope Google make a phone this size and have a screen this flat as it would make the perfect phone for me.	R
Wow, very disappointed (S22+)	"Not sure where to begin really. My S10+ was fine aside from the battery was getting tired.
However, it is a much better phone than my new S22+! 
Flickering screen (noticeable in sunlight), videos play out of sync with the sound and don't fully load (stops with the spinning loading sign) and battery life is okay. I thought it would be a lot better.
Honestly, I'd rather just have my S10+ back at this rate and just deal with the tired battery.
So disappointed in Samsung, I hope I'm not alone here."	R
S22 Ultra front camera issue	I've been playing around with the front camera and noticed that sometimes the camera takes photos with an orange tingt - specifically noticeabke on a selfie (the ting is centered in the middle of the photo not like some of the other issues users are experiencing). I can confirm that it's not the filters or settings, in fact rebooting the phone fixes it, which would indicate to me it's a software issue. Also, the photo preview does not have the tint, only once the photo is processed. Has anyone else noticed this?	R
S22 Display not as vivid as S21	Is anyone else's S21 Ultra put up much better colors on a 4K Youtube video than the S22 Ultra? I just compared both and the S21 Ultra has munch better colors. Very strange	R

Calendar Dismiss Button doesn't cancel notification	The Calendar Dismiss Button doesn't cancel notification either by pressing or sliding to the right. The Snooze Button works easily with a finger press but I want to cancel the notification not just postpone it. Other than going into the calendar and manual canceling the alert, what can I do. My old S7 worked just fine.	R
Text reactions gone	I just got my 22Ultra and I was so happy that it had RCS where as I can like and use other reactions to text messages. When a system update happened, the feature vanished and I've been on the phone with tech support for an hour now and nothing is working. SMH what happend?	R
S22 ultra battery life experience has changed	Not too long ago I posted to this community about how my s22 ultra had exceptional battery life. I was using it without any battery saving measures and getting over 10 hours of screen on time with a single charge, and it was amazing. However within the last few days I've dropped down to getting around 4 hours of screen on time, and that's with taking more advanced battery saving measures as well as not having any new applications installed. I'm not really sure what has changed, but if this is what other users are reporting as "bad battery life", I can now say I understand what they mean.If anybody knows what is causing this very strange battery drain, maybe an update that I didn't notice? Please let me know, this phone went from having exceptional battery life to being on par with my previous phone within a matter of a week or two	R
Messages App	So Att S22 Ultra now uses a custom google messages app as default, but RCS is not working with all people who use Google messages. Example my brother is also on Att and he has an Att version of the Fold 3. The default messaging app on that one is Samsungs app but he is using the Google messaging app from the playstore. Messages sent and received from him are SMS not RCS. I have another brother that has a t-mobile s10 and my messages with him are RCS and I think he is even using the default Samsung app. I know I'm not the only one but no one is talking about this.	R
New update makes phone work slow	I just get my new s22u, after update the new system, it works slower than my old s20, (both use same os version) And sometimes s22 u cannt open some apps smoothly such as spotify, edge, Google play .. and it is much easier get warm. Probably the new snapdragon 8 Gen 1? Hope to fix it.	R
hang during work profile	Hello,I am using s22+, I am facing an Issue with a work profile, when my work profile is on then my phone starts lagging or hanging, basically work profile using VPN services. after switching on the work profile, every application start hanging, Samsung do something about this issue,note: I was using this on Oneplus phones very easily, there were no issues in that.

Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra Front Speaker Issues	My S22 Ultra is Having issues with the Front Speaker...When on Messenger it's Very Quiet, So I have to Set it to Speaker..

A lot Better then the S22 Ultra!..I am Hoping there will be a Software Update that will Fix the Audio Issues.. If it's Hardware Related, I'll Replace it...	R
Do Not Disturb until next alarm not working	I have an S22 Ultra (SM-S908U1) and whenever I toggle on the DND with an alarm set, the options screen lists "Until" with the wrong time, which is much earlier than the alarm time. If I reboot the phone, then the "Until" option shows the correct time. It's annoying to have to restart the phone each night just for this.I've attached a screenshot (on the top under the time widget you can see in the background I have the alarm set for 5:35am).Any advice?	R
too many issues afer updating .. Samsung s22 ultra	Hi,Here are some issues / missing features I found, which are present in other basic phones of Mi.1) if we locked the phone someone still can swipe from the top and modify the settings like turn on/off wifi, Bluetooth, mobile hotspot, I did not find the option to disable swipe from the top when the device is locked.2) I installed WhatsApp normally but even if the WhatsApp is locked I still get to see the message someone sent in the notification bar, after I reinstalled it in secure folder, WhatsApp was not able to read my saved contacts and I need to go to WhatsApp and save it again as the no. was never saved before.3) battery is draining quite fast even in normal usage.4) Gestures don't work with 3rd party launchers.5) vertical scrolling is not provided which is really pathetic.Thanks	R
S22 ultra reception......terrible!	So disappointed, the reception on this phone is pitifull and it is frequently out of service. I have been on the phone with my carrier's tech support literally for hours. We have tried everything including changing the Sim card. I have lived at the same address for twenty years and there have not been any structural changes.The next step is to exchange the phone but I think I am going to take it back as my carrier has two week returnpolicy.	R
S22 Ultra Constantly Over Exposes	This is something that can definitely be tweaked/fine tuned via software update, but one thing that I've noticed with my S22 Ultra is that is constantly over exposes images, in bright sunlight it's very noticeable and makes photos look "washed out".It's something that I can adjust with the built-in editing features, so that's nice, but it can get old pretty quick when you have to do this for a lot of photos taken outside in bright sunlight.P.S : I also tweaked the saturation with the image.After edit Before edit	R
Playing Games with Adaptive refresh	Playing games such as tap sports mlb are very glitchy when adaptive refresh is on. Pitches glitch in and out , can't see them half the time . I had to put on standard 60 hz to play a stable game. Not sure if it's something the game developer needs to patch or are other games affected, or is it a Samsung issue, don't know. I've even lowered the resolution to FHD and still glitches.	R
Delayed Gmail notifications fix?	"Just got the S 22 ultra. Still get deleted Gmail notification if the phone is idle for more than five minutes. If it's on charge or I recently said it down under five minutes Gmail notifications come through as normal.  
When it's been sitting for more than five minutes I'll pick my phone up and within a few seconds, all my Gmail notifications come through at once. Sometimes up to 5 to 10 depending on how many emails I got in that time period. Rather annoying if you're trying to run a business with your phone and email. 
This is well documented with a Google search. Does anyone have a fix for this yet other than having to hack your phone to disable doze?"	R
Files not syncing properly due to Andoid changing the modified dates	"Ok, so my PC is my main storage for everything.
Primary backup is my NAS.
I use FreeFileSync for this. 
I don't stream so I have all my music on my phone.
I got the S22 when it came out and instead of conveniently inserting my SD card that I've used for years I had to copy 80 gig or MP3's to my phone. 
Fast forward a few weeks to today.
I added many files and updated some tags so I needed to sync my PC to my phone. 
So I hook up the phone to my PC and let FFS do its normal comparison which the main thing is the date of the files it wants to replace every file on the phone.
They are all different ... being the date I transferred them initially. 
I have a cheap LG that I use at my gym as an MP3 player... it has an SD card and runs the same music app. When I did the update with it it only wanted to copy the new files and the ones that I changed the tags on. 
Any idea what is going on with the Samsung? I actually recall this issue with my S9 as well ... even when using my SD card. 
The only time I've ever had this problem is with Samsung phones....
I know on the pc there is a 'date created' and 'date modified' in Explorer... could this have something to do with the PC to phone issue?
But even if it is why is the problem with my Samsung and not my LG?"	R

Is anyone having issues with their VPN?	I've been using NordVPN on all of my devices (computer, tablet, phone) for around 6 months now, and it's worked SEAMLESSLY. Most of the time, I hardly even realized it was there. However, I traded in my S21+ a couple of weeks ago, and ever since, I've been having constant issues on my S22 Ultra (transferred data using smart switch). It seems like the background performance of the app is the issue. For example, I'll pull my phone out of my pocket, try to load something (regardless of wifi or 5G), and it just stops. I'll have to go into the Nord app, disconnect VPN, reconnect, and then it'll work fine for 5-10 minutes/until I put my phone back in my pocket. I've uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times, and also tried switching protocalls within the app. I'm trying to appreciate everything this phone has to offer, but the CONSTANT connectivity issues are really raining on my parade. My suspicion is that it's some sort of soft sleep for background apps, or an internal setting in the phone itself.	R
Any idea how to fix S22 Ultra saturated and inaccurrate colours?	"Hey guys,
New S22 Ultra user and so far so good. Only thing I've noticed is the colour on this thing is garbage, very oversaturated. I have a pretty high end OLED Panasonic TV to compare it to, along with an iPhone 12 pro Max, both the Panasonic and iPhone are consistent with each-other, but this phone has very saturated colours and its inaccurate sadly. Is there any fix?
I had an S21 Ultra on hand and noticed the same thing but it seemed less pronounced than on this newer model. Seems really odd as Samsung make panels but can't calibrate them?"	R

I've had nothing but problems regarding Android auto in my car since getting the 22 ultra. can anyone else relate?	"Since I got the 22 ultra, my phone randomly disconnects from Android auto and my car has a heart attack, flashing between ""connecting"" and ""cannot read USB"", rapidly. On my phone, my GPS icon flashes constantly, so my information bar at the top is constantly fluctuating. When it works, it works well, but there's no working to when it will randomly disconnect.
I've updated Android auto, I've made sure my phones firmware and software is all up to date, and I even updated my cars infotainment since the I found this issue.
For what it's worth, car is a 2020 hyundai sonata hybrid limited, and I never had these issues with my 20 ultra"	R

Connectivity Issues	I'm pretty sure it might be my phone due to it having issues connecting to various Bluetooth devices.

I was just wondering if anyone has had this issue as well ?	R

S22 Plus (SD) Charging really slowly using the official 25W Charger.	"Like the title says, I have been using the phone for about 4 days right now and bought the official 25W Samsung Charger and the cable that came with the phone. The charging speeds have been consistently slow. From all the reports and videos I have seen online with the same charger, the phone takes around 1 to 1.10 hrs to charge but it takes me around 1 hrs 50 mins (every time) which is quite a big difference. The phone says 40 mins left or 30 mins left but 
I have turned on the Super Fast Charging and Fast Charging options in the settings along with Adaptive battery in the ""More battery settings"" but it is still slow.
Is this normal for a new phone, is it the same for others, is this the case initially or do I have a faulty charger?"	R

S22 Ultra slow?	I came from a pixel 6 pro which was pretty snappy. I noticed the s22 will register my touch but it won't actually do anything until I hit it again. Sometimes I'll wait and eventually it'll register the first time. Not something I expect from the top of the line phone from Samsung. It makes getting around on the phone kind of annoying.	R

Galaxy S22 6.1 getting super hot when using Adaptive Refresh Rate	My device just got INCREDIBLY hot when browsing Amazon. It was not plugged in, but the case was on and the phone was connected to WiFi 6. Removed the phone from the case to find that it was extremely uncomfortable to hold. The aluminum frame, screen, and upper rear near the camera (especially) were like a flaming ember. Tried a restart and it didn't fix it. Once I lowered the refresh rate to a standard setting of 60hz, the phone finally cooled off and is now a normal temperature. Has anyone else experienced this? I've had the phone for a couple of weeks now and this is the first time this has happened. Maybe the adaptive refresh got stuck on 120hz causing massive heat buildup? I read on some other forums that the previous Galaxy S series devices had similar issues, specifically the S20 series.	R
S22 Ultra Auto Rotate Bug?	The auto rotate resets to portrait when phone is upside-down.In the previous models, when the auto rotate is on, turning sideways and then upside-down locks the screen to landscape mode.I already tried restarting and resetting the phone but I still get the same problem.I don't have another s22 to test this to confirm if it's a hardware issue but I'm leaning to software problem since streaming apps like YouTube is not affected by it.If anyone is having the same issue or if anyone knows how to fix this, let me know	R

Lag, all of a sudden...	Anyone experiencing lag when opening apps? Also Google photos is all of a sudden having issues where sometimes it's showing all of my pictures from archive as if it's having issues with backup. After a few hours google photos returns back to normal. Also I'm noticing super fast charging is much slower that it was. This is started I think after the most recent update. Before it was super snappy and no lag. Unlocked Verizon. Snapdragon. 256 12gig ram. I've cleared cache partition, restarted a bunch, deleted all data in Google photos etc... Samsung gallery is showing pictures as normal. There was a point where Google photos showed nothing as if I didn't have any photos. I know this is mostly about an app but I noticed the app started having issues when phone became laggy. Just curious if I'm the only one.	R

s-view flip cover	I have the samsung s-view flip cover on my s22 ultra and sometimes, like once a week, it just doesn´t show the always on display.

Possible Temporary "fix" for "Warning: Camera Failed"	"I think I may have found a temporary fix for the camera failing on the S22 Ultra. I noticed it only really happens to me when I'm connected to a 5G network. If you experience camera failed then put your phone in airplane mode and try to take another picture. My 0.6x camera fails only when 5G is on that I've noticed so far but when it works it takes beautiful pictures. So I don't think it's a hardware failure but a software bug possibly.
I was at work trying to take a picture and my 0.6x camera kept failing until I put the phone into airplane mode and then all of the sudden it started working again and I was able to take a picture with out it lagging or crashing."	R
Android Auto on Pioneer Headunit not working	Has anyone else experienced Android Auto not working with the S22 (regular) when trying to connect? It recognizes the phone, bluetooth connection, it just doesnt show the user interface (shows a gray screen instead). Worked fine with my S20 Ultra earlier today and had an S9+ on it as well early on. If you're had these issues, how did you solve it? TIA.	R
Any battery suggestions before I sell it for a Pixel 6? I have the US SD8gen1 variant of the base S22. This is my battery life at 120hz without battery saver, this has been the case since I got the phone mid-feb. With Batt saver on, I see closer to 6 hours SoT, but I would like high refresh.		R
Galaxy S22 ultra (snapdragon) Netflix and YouTube issue	"So YouTube keeps reverting to 480p if I go to my homescreen. I have YouTube premium so I have background playback. When I go back into the YouTube app the video locks into 480p and all the higher quality settings are gone. Can only do 240p 360p and 480p. I have to close and reopen the app to fix this issue.
With Netflix. I am trying to watch a HDR TV show. Ozarks. In dark scenes I cannot see anything. It's super dark. It feels like the phone is locked at half brightness.
There seems to be a bug with the brightness slider. When I slide it all the way up the phone brightness starts to get brighter then it snaps back down to a low brightness.
I tried uninstalling both apps but this is getting frustrating."	R
extend battery life	Can you please share settings to extend battery life, I'm not happy with my S22 + SD. I'm even thinking of switching of adaptive refresh rate and keep it on 60.

Hi Guys! I've been using S22 base model for 2 weeks now. In the YouTube app for most of the videos, when I'm in fullscreen, I see no options for the video quality when I click the gear button. Can someone help me with it? Am I the only one with this problem? I've added the link in the comments		R
Bixby automatic routine sometimes not working	I have an automatic routine set to activate dolby atmos to Pop when apple music is open but it sometimes doesn't work, when I check the option in the settings it's turned off, then switching back and forth from the app it finally decides to enable.

Update - s22 ultra totally broken	"I posted a while back that my phone was rebooting and shutting down altogether at random times.  To whoever thought it was defective, you were right. Yesterday it shut down totally and won’t reboot. Fortunately, ATT is sending me a replacement. Unfortunately, I have no way of getting anything off the original phone at this point as it won’t boot, even when plugged in.
I’ve had several galaxy phones in the past (note 5, S8, note 20 ultra), and never had this critical of an issue happen with a phone before; hopefully it doesn’t portend bad things about the replacement.
Just an fyi for anyone else having this issue - your phone is likely defective."	R

Abysmal performance on S22U snapdragon	"I used 3d benchmark app, and the first time I ran the test on optimized performance mode I scored 7386, so I witched to max performance mode, and it dropped to around 3000. Switching to mid grade performance yielded a score of around 5000, with an average frame rate in the low 20s, and if I switched back to optimized mode, I still scored in the low 5000s which the app said is better than 5% of other Galaxy s22 ultra phones.

S22 persistent Bluetooth issues on call with cars.	My note 10 worked great. Updated to the S22 and now it drops the connection to my car while I'm in calls. It still shows connected but says call ended. It use to also hang up when I tried to enable speaker right after that. Samsung wanted me to send my phone in and have no phone while it was being evaluated but then Verizon said they would swap it with a like new phone. Exact same issues on the replacement.I have tried every recommended troubleshooting step from Samsung and Verizon. I also work in tech for my job so I am not a novice. I've found quite a few other people with the same issue I have a 2016 toyota highlander and the software is up to date on the entertainment system. Others have different manufacturers cars with he same issue. One person said Verizon has given them 3 different phones with the same issue. Music playback seems fine but calls dropping while your driving is a dangerous issue since you have to handle your phone.The phone also won't play music after the issue unless you turn off the Bluetooth and try to reconnect, even though it's says it's still connected. The phone controls on the car stop controlling the phone also.	R

Constant High Ping Spikes When Gaming Through Wifi	"I don't know if it also happens when I'm browsing or streaming videos in Youtube, Netflix or Twitch (livestreams don't buffer), but whenever I play games through wifi, I get constant high ping spikes. When I'm playing Wild Rift, it will sit in 60ms for 5-10 seconds then jump to 200 ping or higher for 2 seconds then go back to 60 ping then it will jump again. I was hoping it was a software issue and it would be fixed by next update, but it didn't. When I'm playing Clash Mini, I would place a Mini/Character in the board then it would disappear from the board when or before the round starts. On Clash of Clans it would constantly load/buffer when I'm watching an attack replay or live attack. Supercell doesn't have a ping indicator, but I feel like it's also a ping problem. It doesn't happen to my Oneplus phone, my brother's phone, or my laptop wifi. These things don't happen when I'm using mobile data in a place with good signal. I honestly don't mind just playing with mobile data, but I have poor signal in my apartment. Can't play ranked in WR with friends cuz we keep losing cuz i'm lagging all the time. My internet and router is from Bell, but i don't think it matters because it doesn't happen on other devices. I was thinking about returning my s22u, but it's been with me for a month.

Weird thing happening with the camera getting blurry for apparently no reason.	"Hey so I've occasionally had this issue where I go to take a picture of something, fairly close but still several feet away and the entire picture is super blurry and I have no idea why.  It happened at work when I had to take a picture of something and I just messed with it until it was ok but it was iust on normal photo mode at 1x with nothing special going on. I thought it was a one off until it happened again yesterday. I was able to go to .6 and it would get clear then switch it back and it was blurry again. But going to .6 isn't really a good solution it changes the picture a lot.

S22+ [SD] stuttering horribly while recording in 4K in both 60 and 30fps.	"Like the title suggests, the recording stutters horribly especially in the first 2-6 seconds. Even the fps in the details tab is around 18-26 and 42-56 fps. My 4 year old Oneplus 6 records more stable videos. Doing some digging around online I found some other users complaining about this.  
In my country, Samsung don't replace or refund my money unless it is deemed to be defective by a ""certified service center"" so I went to one of these places and these people are straight up morons. They claimed this is nothing but ""motion"" whatever that means and when I showed them the fps, they didn't what I was showing them. They suggested I try super steady video and it will be better! When I pried more they finally said they will re-install the OS. This actually made it worse. When I complained again, they said they can't classify this as a defect and they can't help me.  
I am wondering if more people are facing this issue and for those who did and got the April update, did it make a difference?"	R
S22 Ultra Snapdragon janky performance	"I've had my Galaxy S22 Ultra since release and I've always noticed the phone seems to have slightly janky animations/performance around the home screen.
Few examples:
- When I swipe up on an app to go home, I notice the animation isn't perfectly smooth when it goes back to its spot on the home screen.
- When I swipe to the side to see the Google news feed, the animation stutters and the first few frames when scrolling down stutters too.
- Pulling down the notification shade has stutters.
When I do any of the above multiple times in succession, it's smooth, but the first time or two it'll really stutter and look crappy. Maybe I'm just too pedantic about it, but I notice it all the time and it looks bad. I'm just using the stock launcher, no crazy icon packs or anything just all stock.
Also apps like Twitter and Reddit are extremely stuttery when scrolling. I know those apps generally stutter, but these are really stuttery - more than other Android phones I've used.
Any ideas on how to fix this?"	R

Unimpressed	I gotta say that I am disappointed by this phone. I have theS22 ultra and an coming from the Note 10+. It's not really better than my previous phone plus there's no expandable memory! The battery is eh. It's not a terrible device but it's not worth the upgrade. I do feel jipped a little bit I'll live. Definitely thinking about exploring options outside of Samsung on my next go around. We'll see.	R
Reddit app chat not working with my new S22	"Hi all,
I've just upgraded to a new phone, a Samsung S22 (used to have Samsung S12).
The Reddit mobile app used to work fine on the old phone, but now on the new phone, the app will crash every time in under a minute if I leave it open on a chat screen (eg personal DM chats, or Mod chats). App doesn't crash if i leave it on other screens. App never crashed at all on the old phone.  Oddly if I've typed something into the current chat window already, then I can leave it there happily and it won't crash, but if I haven't yet typed something, then it will crash in under a minute.
Have tried uninstalling, reinstalling, old app versions clearing cache, clearing data all multiple times.  Been through every single setting I can find.
App version 2022.11.0.433004 and Android 12, UI version 4.1 on both phones.

Network issues S22U T-Mobile	I've had an on going issue with my S22U since I've gotten it where I can't use my mobile network despite being connected (aside from the sending data arrow not lighting up).

S22 Ultra camera issues?	Hopefully this is a common issue that is easily fixed, but I appear to have a phantom glowing diamond that shows up during video capture using the lense (108mp?) for 1.0-2.9 zoom. It is an off center dot that makes its appearance based on lighting. It is digital in the sense that it is either completely present or completely absent. There is no gradient to its intensity. I haven't seen it make an appearance on photos, so I think it is strictly a video issue. Any help to bust this ghost dot would be greatly appreciated.	R

4K 30fps Video skips frames/ stutters every time you start recording in the HDR10+ mode. [S22 plus, SD]	"Like the title says, I've noticed a massive stutter or two almost every time I start recording in this mode. I noticed it with the normal 4K30 mode too but it is comparatively rare and not as bad. I have also turned off auto frame rate. Even the details section in the gallery app shows the frame rate of these videos between 18-25.
I was wondering if other are facing this issue, if it's a software thing and if Samsung are aware of it or do I just have a defective unit? (Is it an issue with the other s22 models too?)"	R

Bluetooth audio not automatically turning on.	Usually when you have Bluetooth on and then connect a device, it turns on calls and audio. For some reason, Bluetooth is not connecting with both calls and audio enabled, only calls if that. It's happening across multiple devices including wireless ear buds, fancy Bluetooth headsets, car stereo units, Bluetooth speakers, etc. I've gone down the list of troubleshooting for generic BT issues but it's still not working correctly.Clearing pairs, re-pairing, trying a new device, clearing cache/data on Bluetooth system app, pairing devices to other phones first, restarting phone, etc.Sometimes when it connects it connects with nothing turned on (no calls or audio).I have to manually enable audio 9/10 times I connect a device and it takes upwards of 30 seconds before the phone actually registers it and begins playing out of the device regardless of what the Bluetooth menu says.What else can I do to resolve this?This issue went from a minor inconvenience I thought was associated with my Method Wireless headset to a constant issue across numerous devices.

Unlocked S22 Ultra 5G Reception Issues on T-Mobile, Verizon	So I got my s22 unlocked two days ago, and there's been a consistent issue in which it completely drops service. No calls, text, or data. It happens randomly and quite consistently, sometimes multiple times in the span of an hour. Called T-Mobile and they didn't know what it was. The only fix I've seen work on my phone is restricting the phone to 4G LTE in the network settings. I've seen this exact same issue from multiple users across different Samsung related subreddits and online. I was wondering if anyone has had the same issue and resolved it by any chance? Some have said it's hardware issue but different users have gotten replacement handsets and still have the same issue. Like I mention earlier in the post, I was able to fix it by restricting the network to4G LTE, but I'm not really happy about a $1300+ flagship handset that I waited for over a month to receive having an issue this ridiculous and annoying.

Bad camera quality in Snapchat - Galaxy S22 Ultra	Hello all,The selfie camera quality in Snapchat is so "enhanced" it makes skin look awful.It looks like under the microscope and every skin detail is enhanced and over-saturated in color.A freckle looks like black on white background that's how enhanced it is -- even if in reality it's barely noticeable and also in the phone camera app it's barely visible. Every hair pore looks like it's a crater on mars.Any idea what can be done to fix it? It's literally disgusting the way it shows skin. Kind of like using those 3x magnifying mirrors to pluck eyebrows. This has the same level of detail, without the zoom and with exaggerated contrast and saturation.Compared to the Note 9, Note 10, Note 20 or iPhone 12, 13, my skin looks so much worse on the S22 that I feel uncomfortable using the app and sending photos to people.

S22 ultra and s21 ultra video call quality (low and inconsistent frames)	Im not sure why NO ONE AT ALL TALKS ABOUT THIS, but i have noticed some some seriously low and distracting frames per second during video calls. When it begins to behave very choppy all i have to do is hit the software flip button or something to refresh camera. Once i do that then the fps will revert back to a more smooth 30fps or 60fps. but only for a for a few seconds then it reverts to the unbearable 15-20 fps video calls. I can replicate this issue across all video calling apps on the galaxy s22 ultra. my s21 has had this same exact bug since launch and samsung continues to ignore this. I dont understand how they could let this bug now come on to the s22 ultra as well. Ive gotten multiple s21 ultras replaced for this reason thinking i had a defective device but no its just samsung being extremely ghetto with software quality control. Cmon Samsung please optimize your stuff. I have to use a ipad from 2018 just to have a smooth video call and i think thats pretty rediculous.	R

S22 Ultra Color and camera bugs? Expert raw vs normal example	OK so I just got this brand new phone I have been getting really bizarre yellowish/murky looking colors. And skin tones are looking ghastly and grey. Ive been trying to find out what the problem is comparing it to old phones from years ago even and color wise this is getting out competed by budgets phones. I know I can edit the pictures but normal pictures should not look this bad. So then I decided to download the expert raw camera app. And low and behold on auto as was the settings before, I get normal looking colors with out editing anything. Of course obviously there's a big problem. Because the front facing camera to my knowledge does not work with expert raw.Look at this example. My wall is off white. Look at these examples.

It stays on my screen for over 20 seconds..it's still on there as I am typing this! I can not read the message or reply back because I can't read the screen under this message! How do I get rid of this? I've tried all different settings in messages but nothing works. REALLY ANNOYING	R
My Galaxy S22 Plus is over heating and I can't hold it to my ear	HiI have the Samsung 22plus. The phone is over heating where I can't hold it to my ear.Please help fix this ASAPANY FEEDBACK IS WELCOMED ALSO	R
Phone headed back...no more	"This phone is going back. Sent one phone back due to GPS coordinates not being placed in photo EXIF file. Replacement does place the GPS coordinated in EXIF file; however, this weekend, constant dropped connections while sitting and not moving as well as when walking around the house and property.
I do live where the service is not great; however, my Pixel 4XL never had (or appears to have) this problem.  
I really liked this phone, loved the screen, liked the customization I could do, like the way Samsung corrected all the strange things Google did with Android 12, but this dropping of connections, on numerous calls with different people just leads me to believe that Samsung is having problems with this model and not worth my time to fiddle fart around.  
Therefore, it is going back and not for another replacement, for good. I'm sure not going to pay $1200 bucks for a phone that does not work as a phone."	R
Bluetooth connection = minimized apps	"I'm not sure what I'm missing with this but I've only gotten this with the S22U. I don't think it is Android 12 related because I had 12 on my S21U and this didn't happen then. 
I first noticed this when I would get into my car, if I had Maps actively navigating full screen, it would minimize as soon as the car connects then display these three choices. See the attached photo. But I don't know what it wants to do.  
As you can see it says Complete action using, Bixby Voice, Google or Tasker. These three aren't really related in any way that I can tell either. If it was Google Assistant and the other two maybe but then why Tasker Secondary not just Tasker? When I press the (i) to get more info it just says to make a selection to complete the task but doesn't say what the task is, why I need to make a selection or what the selection will do. Like I mentioned the options aren't very helpful.  
Since Maps was open you might think that it wants me to initiate a navigation or something with Maps but then I found that it does the same with YouTube. It doesn't minimize Waze, I'm assuming because Waze doesn't have a minimized version but I can't remember if it closes it or if nothing happens. I get the three options even if nothing is open or playing 
Ok so you might think it has something to do with Android Auto or something handsfree since ~two of the three can be controlled by voice but it does this with my BT speaker. So you might think it's BT related but it doesn't do this with Galaxy Buds. I even tried picking a default app. The pop-up doesn't happen but Maps and YouTube still minimize. Besides those apps minimizing I can't tell that anything else has happened.  
Can anyone either tell me what the action needing to be completed is or how to stop this whole mess in the first place?   "	R

Help! Network locked on an unlocked S908e	"Hi. I got my s22 ultra sm-s908e unlocked two weeks ago through Amazon. Everything was working fine until today when I realized I couldn't make any calls in the morning. I saw that on the lock screen on top it said network locked emergency calls only. I rebooted my phone and it got into the network again. But around ten minutes later it got back into network locked.
I have tried almost everything. Cleaning my sim card, resetting network settings, even re applying the network configuration message. Nothing.
The only thing I have done to it was flashing the XSG firmware since it was the latest one and in my country (mexico) the unlocked versions usually get updates really slowly.
Tomorrow I'm going to try to do a factory reset but I'm asking first to see if I fuckrd up something or if my phone was locked somehow.
Hopefully somone can help me."	R
S22 delayed messenger notifications from second account.	"Hello guys!
My S22 has this annoying problem that really bugs me since I feel like a flagship device can't manage the basics properly.
I have 2 messenger accounts registered in my messenger app; however, whenever I receive a message on my the account that I'm not currently logged in, it takes 5 hours before S22 finally notifies me about the new message.
And the ridiculous thing is, even when I've checked the messages, 5 hours later, the device still notifies me about the messages I've already read.
This does not happen with the account that I'm logged in, I receive notifications instantaneously from that one.
To put it in plain language:Account 1 1: logged inAccount 2: left in quick switch
Messages coming in device 1 = I get notified immediatelyMessages coming in device 2 = I get notified 5 hours later, even when I've checked the messages
This does not happen on my Iphone, I get notified immediately, whether the messages are on account 1 or account 2.
The messenger app gets unrestricted power consumption and is set to never go to sleep.
Does anyone know a fix to this, thank you for your help.

Touchscreen not working well	"I've recently noticed that when I try to pull down the notification display the phone doesn't do nothing.  I've had to try multiple times and only then does it do anything.  The same happens when I'm trying to press the back button at the bottom, or certain characters on the keyboard.  Haven't really noticed the issue round the center of the screen.
I have the Samsung standing clear cover but the issue exists without the case on.  I do not have a screen protector, no drops of the phone, etc.  Have the 512GB red US version.

Battery Life after April 2022 update S22 Ultra	"Did anyone elses battery life became worse? I see Google Play Services now using my battery in the background more now in comparison to the March update. Hence I turned off Sync, location, mobile data and auto update on Play Store but this is still using more battery compared to March update.
The weirdest part is that I have a work profile setup and saw an increase of Google Play Services under work profile using battery... on a Saturday... I didn't even turn this work profile on so it's weird that magically after April update this started happening.
Clearing the cache in recovery menu and in Google Play services also didn't help. My apps are exactly the same as before updating and I have the update since it was available in 31st of March. 
I noticed this on Saturday as I lost in idle 20% and had 30% battery life without going halfway through my day. I had to airplane mode the phone before Google Play Services dropped."	R
Ultra Power Saving Mode Still Draining - How to make it stop?	I have been using the base SD s22 with factory reset and the battery consumption is still very high, even in ultra power saving mode (limit apps to homescreen). I basically only use my phone in ultra battery saver mode with only the 4 apps on the main screen (reddit, chrome, gmail, and outlook). It's fine to use it this way because my phone needs to last all day, but the problem is that it still uses about 5-10% per hour in that mode so it's still pretty unreliable. I wake up at 7am and the phone is at 89% by the time I start work. An hour after starting it's about 78%. I'm I am connected to LTE, not 5g and I've had the phone since launch so it's done learning usage patterns.	R
"Unsupported audio file" after transferring over custom text ringtones	"I discovered that you can in fact get custom text ringtones on this phone, and that even people on here have recommended certain ones. I don't know if I was going about the process incorrectly, but after acquiring each file I would copy them into the folder where the other ones sit.
This didn't seem like much of a problem, until the last two mornings I have found that I've been sleeping through my alarms. This morning as I checked my alarm ringtone sounds, every one that I attempt to select on says ""Unsupported audio file"" and doesn't play the sound.
[https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/8471/iRlGzw.png](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/8471/iRlGzw.png)
I don't seem to have a problem in many other menus, though. Not only that, but those audio files aren't even in the same folder as the ones that I have for Clock ringtones.
To be fair, I can't guarantee these are related. I just assume that they are because of the timing and the similar kind of content. I don't know if anyone else has run into this issue in particular or knows what I can do to revert this, or if there is a different way I should be transferring sound files in.
Thanks."	R

My S22 Ultra crashes/overheats when filming for more than ~10 minutes (in 4k and 1080p, 30fps, main lens)	" 
I have this recurring (but inconsistent) problem of my S22 Ultra overheating when filming (I assume overheating bc it crashes and is warm). I thought it was bc I was in 4k at first until it happened in 1080p too, but the fact that it is happening at all is still a problem.
This is a problem I had on my Pixel 3XL filming in 4k. Despite its problems, my Pixel 6 Pro never crashed filming. **Is this a wide spread problem or an issue with my phone specifically?** It has happened multiple times for me, and not in the hot sun, but in the cool environment of my own home."	R

I have a new Galaxy Ultra S22 flagship device(512MB)  = junk.

I was referred to the fixing center of the local distributor.
the line of pixels used to be 1.5 cm in size and become smaller since but it's there.
The response was to Leave the device for up to 10 days, we will probably replace your screen with a new one since you have Burned pixels.
everybody knows that after opening the phone and tach the screen it’s the begging of the end.

Poor Quality Control S22 Graphite 256GB	"Graphite US model 256GB. 
Received my phone, tried setting it up, can't get passed the first Welcome screen. It freezes then restarts and brings me back to the welcome screen.  The phone is also overheating even though it's just the welcome screen and restarting. You can't shut it off either. 
Things I've tried:
1. Boot loader factory reset. Wipe cache. 
2. Try to get through welcome screen setup and hope apps update or something to fix problem.
3. Let battery drain. 
Nothing has worked. I can't believe I got a faulty device after waiting 5+ weeks. Customer service won't do jack shit. Says to return it and order it again. No compensation. No expedited order. No nothing. Terrible. 
Is anyone else having the same issue? Any help would be great. Don't want to FIX a brand new phone Ive only had for less than an hour. 
Thanks."	R
Mic problem on S22+, sometime works sometime not	"Hello there, got my S22+ 3 weeks ago. Everything is working fine until this week. The phone mic sometime just suddenly stop working. I can hear but cannot talk, tried voice recording too at the mic does not work at all. I had to restart the phone.

To everyone that has problems with the S22 (reboots, force closes, crashes,...)	"I think I have found the cause for this.
If you enable Developer Options and enable Gpuwatch you'll experience soft reboots and app force closes and crashes. This soft reboot isn't a proper reboot. Apps don't work correctly afterwards. You have to make a proper reboot.
Seems gpuwatch is buggy in it's current state. DON'T enable it or disable Developer Options completely."	R

Something is fucky with it right now. I'm gonna submit this as feedback to Samsung.
Edit: This applies to 4k30. For me, since you can't change lenses in 4K60 mode, I had no stutter whether this setting was enabled or not."	R

Base SD S22 Poor Bluetooth Quality Music in Car. Weak/hollow bass. Is there a way to fix this?	"The audio quality in music via Bluetooth is tinny and hollow. The bass is noticeably weaker when I play music on my S22.

I use a USB-C to Aux cord now and the quality is normal again, but it's quite inconvenient because I really need to have this phone plugged into a charger while driving because the battery drains insanely fast.
Anyone else have this problem or know how to fix it?

Anyone else having overheating in hot environments with Base S22 SD?	I switched from the Note 20 Ultra because it was dying from various issues and I was tired of the curved screen and size. In this hot environment of the Caribbean I live in, the Note 20U did get hot, but the SD gets incredibly hotter even when just browsing the web or using something like reddit. I was wondering if anyone else living in warmer environments was experiencing the same thing.

My phone is even thermal throttling because of it, with things like keyboard popping up or switching between apps giving me horrible stutters.	R

protect battery Android Auto bug	I think I have found an error with Android Auto and the option to protect battery on the S22 ultra. My phones connects just fine to the Android Auto in my truck. However, I wanted to limit the battery charge to 85% as supported by the protect battery option in the settings. I implemented the feature last night.I get in my truck the next morning and notice that the Android option isn't activating once the phone is connected. Checked the cable and usb ports. Both firmly connected. The phone is also mentioning slow charger and that I should change the usb port to a faster one. It has never done that for as long as I have owned the phone (three days).I'm thinking it must be a setting. I turned off the option to protect battery (keep from charging the phone past 85%). Android Auto still did not activate. Power cycled the phone. Android Auto turned on and tested ok. No more slow charger messages coming up on my phone.Seems like a bug that may have slipped by QC.	R

Overall Samsung Galaxy Issue one UI 4.1	I have been a long time Galaxy Note user. I have had every Note but the 7 due it being discontinued. I pre-ordered a S22 Ultra along with Buds Pro and Watch 4. Complete user overhaul. Started to notice small issues so, new equipment no problem but buggy takes some time to work kinks out. Received new update nothing really cheanged still Super buggy. Bluetooth connection issues apps shutting down closing, apps opening uncommanded when pressing another, and phone will just go to sleep. Wow so called Samsung went through all trouble shooting procedures including repair store visit. Decided to return maybe I received a bad one made on a Friday afternoon. Placed Sim card in my Note 10+5g. Noticed same issues too include screen locking and not responding. Wait what this has never happened. Software is the only thing common between the 2 phones. Samsung released software not quite ready compared to old software releases this is what is actually delaying the phones. They know it's bad. So disappointed I might just have to try the dark side Iphone for a every day driver. This sucks but 1300 of known bad software. Maybe time. Sorry so long but worth it.	R

S22 Ultra Heating Issue??	I play a lot of mobile games and I have the game booster on priority mode. When I do play the phone heats up faster then I would expect. Game options are all on medium or maximum depending on the game. But this doesn't happen on my iphone. I bought my s22 specifically for fun And mobile gaming is anyone else having this issue of the phone getting to hot. Top left corner gets so hot it's hard to not worry.I called Samsung and they said the phone shouldn't do this but they can only offer a return and my trade-in was already sent in so that cancels out then they asked me to buy Samsung Care Plus wait 30 days and then make a new claim to get a replacement.

Game quality and play is terrible	Hello just upgraded from a S20 Ultra to a S22 Ultra 3 days ago. I play Madden mobile and COD and both are terrible on the s22 compared to the s20. I do live in the usa if that matters. Main problem on Madden for one within the game I no longer have an option for ultra high graphics like I did on the s20. All the pages you scroll through within the app lag and almost dont scroll down without multiple finger swipes. Game play is laggy even on the lowest settings. Why would all this be on a newer "better" phone? Ive read about the possible GOS which I did try to deactivate and it did not help, any suggestions?	R
Phone stays unlocked after a call over a Bluetooth headset	Hi all! I have noticed that my phone(S22) stays unlocked after a call over a Bluetooth headset. Here it is: Phone is connected to my Bluetooth headset and I receive a call. I answer it and continue my conversation. After that call, I just leave my phone alone for any length of time and when 8 come back, phone doesn't ask me for my pin or fingerprint. After I lock it, then it starts working as expected.Notes: this behavior was noticed even before March update.Also it is not an issue with my phone's settings or an app glitch as this was happening out of the box.	R
S22 Ultra	I do NOT recommend the S22 Ultra! I pre-ordered it and had to send it back due to it not being able to read SIM cards... I had to return then repurchase. They have NO replacement policy... for their defective items. So, I returned and then repurchased just to get another defective phone. The phone will not read the SIM. I've talked to MANY people. I was offered a 5% discount on my $1600 order to keep the first defective phone. 🤦‍:female_sign: I did, however, get a $50 discount on my second phone and $100 promo code for the inconvenience... BUT that doesn't help with the fact that I have a $1600 phone that won't work for services. I don't know about anyone else, but I don't like my money going back and forth between accounts. To even have to do that is ridiculous. I wish there was someone else that I could talk to about this, because I am not getting anything done. It's ridiculous. Samsung has gone down.Bring back customer service! Bring back the replacement policy! All Samsung is doing is losing loyal customers. FIX YOUR THINGS SAMSUNG!!!	R
S22 battery dies quickly?	I got my s22 ultra and it seems like it dies fairly quickly. My last phone a a70 would go a whole day and my s22 ultra has less than 30 percent when I got home. I'd usually have 40-50 on my a70. Is there something wrong with my phone?	R
USB Microphone issues S22 Ultra	I recently purchased the s22 ultra and the only issue I am having is when it comes to using a USB Microphone. I often used my mic on my phone to record and it always worked with my note20 and other past Samsung devices. I connect them using a Samsung type c to usb adapter.However, every time I try to use my mic on this phone, i sound like a chipmunk and there's a constant scratching sound that interrupts the recording. I've had a similar issue before once when using the same Samsung adapter on a Xiaomi phone, so I am wondering if it's the adapter not being compatible with the s22 ultra.Has anyone else had this issue before? And if so, is there any solutions?	R
Bad Phone or bad update? S22 Ultra	Just received my S22 Ultra 512GB Red Snapdragon about a week ago and I've had nothing but issues with it. The issues that I'm currently experiencing are1) Overheating - My device gets hot doing normal tasks like browsing the web. Much worse if I'm charging it.2) Lag - My device seems to lag a ton and freeze up often.3) App crashes - Apps just randomly crash or don't work properly.4) Touchscreen - Sometimes when I tap on the screen nothing happens and I have to press multiple times and fairly hard.5) Delayed notifications. My S21 goes off way before my S22. Sometimes it'll be 15 minutes before I get them.6) Short battery lifeI have my S21 Ultra right next to me and both phones have identical apps, settings, and files. Yet the S22 seems like junk to my S21.Any fixes or solutions out there?	R

Speakers Crackling	I have a galaxy s22+ and I am experiencing speaker crackling. I returned my first one as it was defective and my second one is also doing it. I heard the cold might affect this so I experimented. I had my phone out in cold (on me) (if it's not super cold outside maybe try the refrigerator) and when I turned the volume on, I didn't even turn it on full blast and the speaker was crackling BAD.The cold makes a $1,000 phone not work properly.What in the world. Samsung, you need to fix this. Please make another "active" version of your phones. I had to give up my s8 active for this phone. Very sad. You would think that a current year phone would be infinitely better than a phone released 5 years ago. This is just not the case. Very sad.	R
No longer receiving notification sounds via blue tooth since update	I was thinking this was an issue with all notifications, but I've been troubleshooting and I now think I've isolated it to text messages and a few others now. I'm using the Samsung "Messages" appI am no longer hearing ANY app notifications via my blue tooth earpiece (Plantronics 5200) ..If my phone is connected to the earpiece.. I do not hear sounds either way.. if my earpiece is turned off. .. I hear the notifications through my phone. This issue started occurring once I had the most recent Samsung. update installed on my OS. .It is quite annoying as I use my earpiece for work so it is on all day.. and I now have to constantly check my phone to see if there are any text messages.. weather alerts.. remote camera views etc.Even on social media I have to manually check if my blue tooth is on.I have tried everything.. clearing cache's, rebooting system.... unpairing and pairing the eairpiece.. going through safe mode.. etcNothing worked.I am thinking now for sure that this is an issue with the SAMSAUNG OS that they just updated.ANyone experiencing this?

Instagram Stories Freezing	Hi, I'm having problems with the S22 Ultra Verizon. My Instagram stories are freezing when they are auto-playing. After a 3-4 stories the next one stars loading and I get the loading circle in top of the screen, the only solution is click to move to the next and go back to load correctly the video. It's anyone else having this same behavior with Instagram stories? I tried with 5G and wifi and same results. Thanks!	R

S22 ultra Bluetooth issues	Upgraded from note 10 plus. When connecting Samsung watch to new phone, found not all data for Samsung health is working between devices now. Cannot check 'input device'' in Bluetooth settings in phone so that steps or sleep data will transfer. Have followed all online instructions, now they want me to send watch for repairs. Nothing wrong with watch, as it works with other devices fine, it's obviously a bug in new software of new phone. How do we reach someone to address issue in new phone?	R
Notification issues compared to old S9	Hi, on my Galaxy S9, I have email notifications set up so that when I receive a new email, the Email App badge shows the number of new emails, but the notification doesn't appear on the notifications panel (at the top of the screen, next to the time) unless I drag it down.Now I have an S22 and I can't figure out how to replicate that. If I turn off Notifications, it turns off App Icon Badges.It really clutters up the top of my screen to show a symbol every time I get a new email, but I still want to see that I have a new email via the app icon badge.See screenshots below. Screenshot 1 & 2 is what appears on my S22, and screenshots 3 & 4 show on my S9 I don't receive that icon, but still get the badges.Hope this makes sense.thanks	R
Battery and Display Issues	I have been experiencing a crazy amount of lag on my S22 Ultra, the device is having trouble doing everything, from opening apps to typing, and today I woke up to a purple bar across my screen that activated every time I press down. I heard that issue only happens on QHD+, but I was on FHD+. I also woke up to the battery being on 70 percent even though it was on the charger all night. I am not liking my experience with this phone so far. I had the S21 Ultra and had no issues, honesley, this is ridiculous.	R

S22Ultra Pen and Camera issues after update	I use the S-Pen a lot for photography. I even created my own portable phone mounting so I can extend the phone (was using a Note 10+) and trigger the camera with the S-Pen from up to 4-feet away.Recently, I have started having issues with the S-Pen not working with the camera. It seems to work ok for regular usage/note taking/etc. But it won't trigger the shutter.Thinking about what has changed, the first thing that came to mind was the big update which included camera "fixes" (As a side note, if I had not gotten this update, I was thinking of sending the phone back since the up-close/"macro" photo qualities was as bad as the Note 20Ultra which I sent back due to these kinds of issues).After the S-Pen is pulled out (with the camera active), the S-Pen icon shows up and after a minute or so, a notification pops-up saying the "S-Pen is disconnected - Tap here to connect it again". If I tap on the S-Pen menu and the gear/setup icon (all of this is working even though it says the S-Pen is disconnected), checking the "Air actions" option at first says "connecting" and then after 30-seconds it says "Inside phone" even though it is in my hand/being used.I tried the "Reset S Pen" which worked for a bit (so does restarting the phone) but then quits working. I have tried the new option to always keep the S-Pen connected but as it warns, it does increase battery usage (doesn't say which battery - phone, S-Pen or both) and I noticed a big drop in the phone battery.I tried the "Scan for S Pen" option which brings up an interesting window saying "S Pen Pro - Press and hold the Connection button on your S Pen for 3 seconds until the LED starts blinking". My first though was "What LED"? Either way, this didn't work - never could find the S Pen.Other discussions about S Pen issues mention something magnetic that might be interfering but that doesn't pan out. I have a simple holster cover.I have noticed a 1-2 second lag when it does work with the camera and taking a photo. I have see other discussion about this lag being reported but not yet acknowledged by Samsung.	R
Linking messages with Verizon S22 to Tab S8 (wifi only) doesnt work	HiAppears that Verizon customers are not going to be able to link their S22 with a Tab S8+ tablet unless it is cellular enabled. Has anyone been able to make it work????Tmobile and others allow Samsung to move the data as long as they are on the same wifi and logged into Samsung. ATT and Verizon block it.OK verizon offers an alternative - you need to use their Messages+ service to link them.But it only works on a tablet on the Verizon mobile network - which must be cellular enables and must be registered as a line with Verizon.WHY??? - We use wifi to move the exact same data!!!Samsung - why is it not made clear that Verizon customers wishing to link their phones must purchase a cellular enabled tablet????Verizon - why the limitation?????Any way around this??? Appreciate any help!!!	R

S22 ultra getting "camera failed"	My camera app will not open I have tried all the suggested solutions and the only way it was solved was by a factory reset.

VCS calendar file attachment in samsung messages app won't opne	Ok... love my s22 ultra. But recently, I discovered an issue/hiccup. My son has an s21 ultra. I had an s7 edge. We'd share calendar files (.ics) via text without issues. Now I have s22 ultra. When he sends/shares with me a calendar event, his phone says "ICS file will be converted to VCS or VTS format." It shows up in my messages as vcs file, and when I click/press on it, nothing happens. I have to download it, then find in a file manager like app, and select calendar to open it and it works then, but still not through messages. Seems like a waste to have to do this. Especially since it worked fine w my S7 edge. So, I tried 2 things... I sent him a calendar event, and it went thru as ics file no problem. Then, I had him share a calendar event with me using gmail instead of messages. His email had the attachment as ics file as well. No issues whatsoever w ics in gmail. I didn't ha e to save file, open it later, then select app. Weird. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Anyone else having this issue? 	R

Google Maps display dimming automatically when using Google Maps	"It seems that either Samsung or Google is dimming the screen of the S22 Ultra on purpose when using Google Maps regardless if you have Adaptive brightness etc
Just open Google Maps search something and start navigating (walking, driving it does not matter) and the screen will start dimming in less than a minute. I will say it goes as low as if you would set your brightness to around 30%. This is barely visible when you are outside.
&amp;#x200B;
If you switch another app, let's say you switch to Chrome for a quick search the brightness got back up to where it should be in seconds. Go back to Maps and it starts dimming again after a few seconds.

I have see olds threads from previous generations of Galaxy and people say it is related to screen burn prevention. While I appreciate Samsung caring about this I would rather be able to use my phone in Google Maps!

Samsung music problems	Hello, I have the s22u I was listening to music today with Samsung music app. I noticed some of my songs would not play, saying failed to play track. I noticed that the songs that are having this problem say that they are x-ms-wma. But the funny thing is that they are playing just fine on my note 20u that's on android 12 4.1 which I just got the update to 4.1 the other day. The Samsung music app is the same version on both phones. I thought maybe things got mess up with smart switch which was the first time using it, so I deleted all music off the phone and uploaded it from Samsung cloud using my note 20u music backup. Is anyone else having trouble are know what the heck might be going on? I also deleted all data in Samsung music app.	R
Extra dim and yellowish text	Hi all, i have a strange problem and i want to understand if it's normal or not. When I'm in bed i always use night mode + extra dim at 80% but i noticed that when I scroll my rss feed (which has a black background) the articles writings became yellowish while I'm scrolling down through the news. This happens only with extra dim, is it normal?	R
Touch screen	Anyone else notice the edge of their touch screen has stopped working almost entirely? My phone has not suffered any damage or anything, but yet the sides are not working like it used to. I've noticed even just typing has become hard as well. If there anyway to recalibrate the touch screen or anything?	R
GPS Signal issues	I got a US unlocked s22 ultra and I just can't use Google maps due gps problems. This is ridiculous for this expensive phone.	R
Just had 2 weird things happen	"1st thing:
So I use Pushover for notifications of a certain system message that's sent from my server. It buzzes me every morning at 9am and I attend to it. This morning it didn't and when I went into the app, there was a list of missed notifications starting at 9. I never saw them on the phone. This never happened before. The app itself is set to Unrestricted battery mode and notifications are always on. I've been getting notifications from other apps fine. Will message Pushover and get their help. However.....
2nd thing:
My tablet, the S7+, started to ring. It's set to mirror calls from the phone....but the phone itself was not ringing. Has anyone experienced this?
Anyway I restarted the phone. Hope there isn't a serious issue."	R
Hi, i followed this video to set the Bixby routine but I tried it, but sometimes YouTube are going crazy: automatic scroll, when I write some comment the keyboard tap automatically etc. How come?		R
S pen not locking in place	Hey reddit, I need some help. I recently got the s22 ultra, and as of this week, the spen stopped locking in place. It doesn't fall out, but if put against a small bit of force, it fill slide out, even if just a bit. Any tips? Anything helps.	R
Instagram issue while watching stories	Hi all, i saw that everytime I watch a video in the Instagram stories, in the upper right corner there is the "loading" circle that quickly appears and disappears, continuously. Do you see it? If not what can I do to solve it?	R
Has anyone experienced this issue with their home wifi? This happens every night, and a little throughout the day		R
Audio/video sync issues?	"I still have to order my phone, but I'm afraid of this issue that I saw mentioned on Youtube. 
When scrolling through videos, a video would freeze a second while the audio continues playing, thus causing a lag and the remainder of the video being out of sync.
This would be extremely annoying. Is this a common problem? Do you all have this?"	R

myaccountonline issues help!	"TLDR: My account access is paused at myaccountonline and the number it gives me, 1-866-631-8638, seems to have no options for account access issues, nor anyway to talk to a real person. Help?
So I bought the new S22 ultra with Samsung Financing. Got the letter with my account number and go to the website to setup my account. I accidentally put my birthday wrong so the account did not get set up and they paused my access. Calling the number gives my many options, none of which seem to be issues related to account creating or reseting passwords. There is also seemingly no option to be transferred to a representative. What do I do? I eventually need this account to make payments, wtf? This website myaccountonline seems terribly designed."	R
Lots of Issues (Phone Calls, GPS, Battery)	"Hey all,
My new green S22 arrived a few days ago and it's been having quite a few problems. Despite having a much bigger battery, the phone seems to be dying almost as quickly as my previous phone, a 3 year old s10e. Even on 60 hz and power saving it doesn't make it a full day.
I use Android Auto in my 2016 Honda Accord and never had problems with my s10e, but twice in the last few days I've had my phone completely lose my location and I have to navigate without it.
Finally, I've had three people report to me that they had called and had gone straight to voicemail, but my call log shows no record of a call.
Any idea what's going on? With battery saving on, I feel like I just dropped $500 for a telephoto camera, an in screen fingerprint sensor, and a host of issues."	R
Do Not Disturb Timed Options Wrong		R
Wechat notification issues?	Recently switched phones and am having issues with my wechat notifications, does anyone know what may be the problem? Often I don't get notifications unless I open the app, then they start to come in. It's similar to what would happen if it was in sleeping mode.... BUT I put it as a never sleeping app...	R
S22 Hiss Sound when recording video? (example inside)	"Hey Everyone! received my S22 about a week ago and have been enjoying it but noticed something very odd and wanted to know if anyone else experienced this? 
While recording video literally from one clip to the next it started having this weird like hissing noise from out of nowhere and I didn't notice it until I got to my computer to edit the vlog
After seeing that I picked up my S22 to watch the videos I took on the device itself and the hiss sound was there at from a certain clip and every clip after
Example: https://imgur.com/MFSlP3r
Anyone know what caused this? I use my phones to vlog a lot and definitely can't have that happen"	R
Camera Issue S22+		R

speaker problems	Is anyone having problems with the speaker sounding like it is blow? Sometimes it just comes and goes other times it requires a restart.	R
S22 Ultra Lag	"Does anyone know how to reset the phones Ai that is reponsible for battery and app optimization, for the past week my phone is a laggy mess, every app has a lag, delay, and apps dont stay opened in the back, it always resets.
Snapdragon variant."	R
anyone else having video calls use earpiece instead of speaker phone?	"regardless of what video call app I'm using, the s22 is using the phones ear piece, even when I select speaker.
I'm very awkwardly putting the phone up to my ear to hear people during a video calls. it's happening in whatsapp, Facebook messenger, and the dialer’s built in video caller that carriers handle.
any idea what might be causing this or how to fix it?"	R
Accessibility settings open when I swipe up	Quite frequently when I swipe up to go to the home the accessibility settings open and I have no idea why. Is there a shortcut I have setup (gesture shortcut) that I am not aware of?	R
S22 Ultra (SM-S908U) Calls are just static/crackling	"I wanted to start a thread about making calls on the Samsung s22 ultra. Periodically placing a call gives me just a solid wall of static that's all I can hear even though the other side appears to be able to hear me. And other times it's a mix of static and I can hear my call through the static. Right now my phone appears to be on 4G even though I am within a quarter mile of a 5G Tower and the static happened then. I don't know for sure but I'm pretty sure it also happens on 5g.
I don't know who else is experiencing this and I don't know what the options are for trying to fix it. I've tried turning wireless on and off it doesn't seem to matter. I've tried turning Wi-Fi calling on and off that doesn't seem to matter either. I've read posts from people in Europe that they've tried making calls with and without a phone case as well as with new SIM cards and none of that seems to work.
So I thought I would put it out to the community here to see if there's anything else that might be the culprit. It's pretty sad that my old Note 10 was a reliable workhorse and upgrading to this flagship product has been quite the poor experience.
Any thoughts or suggestions on how to make this phone work as a phone would be appreciated. This is a US Verizon based phone model SM-S908U."	R
S22Ultra constant network issues	"Hey so I want to know if anyone else is having these issues. I JUST switched to the S22 Ultra, unlocked and wow I am NOT Impressed. 
I work remote and tether Hotspot daily. Never had issues on my Note 20. But the S22 either never turns on the Hotspot or the connectivity is awful, I can't make phone calls either. Either no one can hear me, I can't hear or the call drops. Texts hardly send etc. The network is awful on this 5g. It really is. I have to reboot the ph9ne every 30 minutes to get the Hotspot to refresh. I've never had so many issues connecting to the internet. It's very unreliable. 
Has anyone else experienced this? I switched back to my note 20 and it's working fine. I'm thinking about returning the s22. I was already hesitant due to lack of SD card and I think the deal is sealed if I can't fix these issues."	R

S22 Ultra Notification Issues	Hi allI've been with Android since day 1 and had many Samsungs but the S22 Ultra seems to have a issue I can't figure a work around.The first day all notifications that sit in the top Notification bar without issue but then noticed it all stopped for eg Ring Door bell, Kids school app, Sky new, Football results, etc etc BUT what's app and Email are ok still.What's even more odd is if I'm looking at my phone and Sky news or doorbell motion happens I get the small notification pop up on screen BUT no sound and nothing holds on phone so if I wasn't looking at that second i would never know about it.I have uninstalled these apps and reinstalled, carried out there new S22 Ultra Samsung update today, gone through phone notification settings in depth over and over again, rebooted phone, cleared cache all no no avail.Im now at a complete loss what to do apart from a factory reset which I really don't want to have to do.Any ideas 🤷🏻🤷🏻	R
S22 Ultra static when trying to make calls	This is my 2nd S22 Ultra since launch. Both produce static sounds when trying to make calls. It is not with every call, but it is often enough and an embarrassment while trying to make business calls as the recipient of the calls sees and hears the calls coming through.I've changed the physical sim cards on both (Verizon) and that does not fix the issue.I've tried with wifi calling on and off and that doesn't help either.The only thing that seems to address the issue momentarily is to close the phone app from the app drawer and reopen. Not something I expect from a $1200 phone and my S21 Ultra had no issue on the same carrier and wifi setup.Has anyone experienced the same and does anyone have a fix? Thanks.	R
S22 ultra pop up mode glitch	When putting YouTube in pop up mode it sometimes becomes unresponsive when switching between apps, even when it's not fully minimized (open to a quarter of screen size approximately). When the pop up YouTube app becomes unresponsive it stays open but every touch input you put into the pop up app gets used as a touch to the app in the background or the wallpaper/widgets behind the app if on the homescreen.

Blank/black screen with my S22ultra using Android auto	Like so many others S22 series user I am having the same issue with what is supposed to be the Rolls-Royce of phones. At this point my Rolls-Royce is more like a 67 Bettle. And it also sense like Samsung, Google, and Android Auto care enough to get this issue resolved. I have tried everything mentioned that others have tried and nothing. Then it's suggested we send a report but no information on how or where to send said report. I was on the phone yesterday with Samsung 3 separate occasions trying to get help to only be told, that Samsung is aware of the issue, but no time line on when this issue will be resolved. We count on for so many things, with our safety as number one and Samsung, Google nor Android Auto caring to get this matter resolved yesterday.Please help us help you get this resolved. A month later our expensive phones are not providing us any safety. I need to enjoy my New Very Expensive phone like I enjoyed my old Samsung S10 plus	R
Samsung pay not working	I recently upgraded to galaxy s22 ultra. The pay app on previous devices worked on all card readers regardless if it had phone pay or not on the card reader. So far i have only been able to use it on readers that allow phone pay. Is this a diwngrade of features on the new phone. My last phone did not have this feature or issue? My last model was s20 ultra.Am i only one experiencing this? Im woried it may be something with the phone being i havent even seen a complaint of this issue online yet.	R
Missing Calls	Hi, I don't know if i do something wrong, this is the problem, when I play a game on my gallaxy s22 and some one call me I do not get the call, go straigth to voice mail, is this normal or i need to modified something on the settings?	R
Broken out of the box	I have received 2 phones now, and both phones have a popping crackling speaker when the phone gets in cold air. Very sad. I talked to someone yesterday who was nice, but they didn't give any solutions to my problems. They told me they'd put me on a call list and after 2 hrs I realized they would not be calling, and they never did. I've been through the wringer just trying to get a phone that works. It just came out last month so I figured it shouldn't be that hard to get a working phone. Very sad to see this happening. I used to love samsung products.I keep getting told I'm a valued customer and then I get 0 solutions. I just want a working phone. The cold weather problem is prominent among galaxy users here on community and redit.	R
Camera Access Notification Sound	When opening Snapchat, the green notification icon that pops up in the status bar is accompanied by an audible sound.

OneUI Home and possible battery drain issue	"Hey!  This is my first Samsung, so I'm not sure if OneIU Home should be using up so much battery?  It's always at the top of my app list with almost 10% of the battery.  Is that normal?  Last night, I noticed my battery dropped from 44% to 30% in 6-7 hours while sleeping!  It seems worse after getting the March update.

Bad Echo on New S22 Ultra	Was excited to get my new S22 Ultra. Had it for a week and started to have bad echo feedback on my end. The person on the other end didn't hear it, just me. It was so annoying, I couldn't talk on the phone. Called T-Mobile and 2 techs suggested tweaks to resolve the issue, but they didn't work. Googled the issue and apparently there is an echo issue with the S22 Ultra. Seems it is a carry over from the S 21 series phones. My battery life was awful too. Only got about 6 hours of usage. I couldn't live with the echo issue so I returned the phone. Thankful it happened within the 14 day return period. Anyone else have this echo feedback issue?	R
Random Crashes on my SS22 Ultra	"Good afternoon, 
I have been having randomly crashes seemingly from nothing on my new phone i have only had it 2/3 weeks now and its been pretty good apart from the random crashes, it would stop allowing any sort of input and then the samsung logo will appear shortly afterwards until  i am able to get back in although sometimes after restart it will not restart correctly and does not display ""phone starting"" like it should upon the restart.

Incompatible with fast wireless charging?	"Hi,
I have two 10W fast wireless chargers : OEM samsung flat one, Car fast wireless charger.
my old phone note 9 shows ""fast wireless charging"" on both.
But my new S22U shows ""Fast Wireless Charging"" on the samsung one, but says ""incompatible with the wireless charger, changing to normal wireless charging speed"" on the car wireless charger.
And it very briefly says ""fast wireless charging"" for 1 sec and changes to ""wireless charging"" and actually increases 1.5x or 2.0x  longer time.
Both chargers have 10W output with 15W input.
Does anybody have the same issue? 
my Gf's S21 also have this same issue. I think Samsung somehow blocked 3rd party fast wireless charger in software."	R

Youtube battery drain? is it because of premium?	"~snapdragon variant~
Hey everybody. So today I've been watching youtube on my s22 ultra. I was in the passengers seat watching youtube and noticed I had poor signal and that my battery was draining. That's normal to me. The phone was looking for signal and using battery to do so. It was like 20 minutes of playback and I lost 8 percent or so 
Well I get home and plug in my phone and bring it up to 74 percent. I take it off the charger and watch youtube on wifi for about 25 minutes. I look up at my battery to see that in such a short time my battery is down to 63%. 
I was having this same exact issue on my note 20 ultra, so much so that I traded it in for this s22 ultra. The problem seems to be just as bad or worse now on my s22 ultra.
I did NOT use smart switch. The only thing I can think of is that it's a problem with my youtube account. I could easily be wrong though. This started after I started a youtube premium trial. I don't know if that's the issue or what. I started the trial on my note 20 ultra and I'm still on it now. 
What gives? Does anyone have some advice? Have you guys had yt drain battery like this? It also makes the phone quite hot. Let me know if you guys have had success dealing with anything like this. Thank you!
Edit: forgot to mention. When this started on my note 20 ultra, it was after the one ui 4.1 update. I don't know if that's relevant, but this problem only started after that. The issue is I started the yt premium trial at the same time as that.
Also, my standby battery life seems to be fine. It's only draining so rapidly while watching youtube videos. Screen off time does not drain nearly any battery.

Bluetooth won't automatically connect with audio!	"I am loving my S22U for everything except this little annoyance. When I connect to my car radio, the Bluetooth will connect for ""calls"" but not audio, automatically. I have to go in to Bluetooth settings and set it to also play audio each time. Anybody else having this issue? It could be on the side of my radio, but old phone didn't do this!
Anybody know how to fix? I was hoping I could find a Bixby routine that did ""when connected to Car, audio is on"" but couldn't find anything lol
UPDATE: Thank you to my two people who suggested things, I learned that it was the radios fault. It has the ability to connect to multiple Bluetooth devices and had my old phone as the Primary device. Weird because it had it as the Primary even though the only phone actually connected at the moment is my ultra, but I figured it out!"	R
Weird touches	I have these weried ghost touches in the bottom of my screen sometimes. And when i try to glide to write on gboard it stops right in the middle like i lifted my finger. If i press harder it writes fine. I have an ESR film screen protector, is it possible it is because of the screen protector?	R
For the people getting the ghost touch, I recommend you sending it back based on my experience.	"It's not the first time Samsung ""created"" the ghost touch after a major update. Last year, many people, including me, were getting the ghost touch after an update on Note 10+. The people with S10 were also reporting the similar issue around that time frame.  Interestingly, it seems everyone with the same phone was getting the same ghost touch spot.
[Finally got the ghost touch on video, now what? : galaxynote10 (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxynote10/comments/jptk8n/finally_got_the_ghost_touch_on_video_now_what/)

[Ghost touch in galaxy s10+ Goes away after restarting, but comes back again after 2-3 days. Tried factory reset but still happens every 2-3 days. Any idea how to fix this? : galaxys10 (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxys10/comments/otxgtk/ghost_touch_in_galaxy_s10_goes_away_after/) 
I'm getting ghost touch 2 to 3 times a day, in the exact same spot as the 1st link. Lock/unlock will solve it temporally, but it will come back and I hate it (especially in games).  I also tried everything, changing screen protectors, trying with/without touch sensitivity, dialing \*#2663#, hard resetting, etc. Nothing really works.
I'm not sure whether it's related to corner hardware parts or corner cases for firmware/software, but the bottom line is, Samsung never fixed it on S10/Note10 series.

If I disable battery protection the graph does show my use from 100% down, but that seems ridiculous.  I want battery protect enabled AND to see how much usage I've had from 100.

Is my device faulty?	I recently switched from iOS to Android, picked up the new S22 Ultra and I have a lot of good things to say about it. However, I'm having issues with notifications. The screen doesn't light up when I get notifications, it'll just vibrate, so I don't even realise I've gotten a notification if I can see my phone but can't hear it. Even when I'm using the phone, most of the time the phone just vibrates when I get a notification and doesn't actually show me a notification at the top of the screen. I have adjusted all the settings I can think of, but surely I'm missing something? Also, is there some way I can make the vibration more intense? I'm picking the most intense one I can find and I can't even feel it in my pocket. Other than this problem, great phone.	R

Decrease touch sensitivity? This is so frustrating...	"Is this happening to anyone else? Coming from an S6 I find the S22 screen very slippery and hard to tap or press and hold without it registering as movement or a swipe. For example, pressing an app icon on the home screen to move it around. If I try to press and hold I end up moving my finger a tiny amount and it fails to register as a hold. I have to really concentrate on holding my finger perfectly still for it to register as a static touch and hold. The S6 wasn't nearly this sensitive.
I see in Settings that there is an Increase Sensitivity option but no option to decrease sensitivity.
Is this happening to anyone else? Anyway to fix it? Would a certain type of screen protector (e.g. tpu?) be less slippery?"	R
Facing a bunch of issues with the Galaxy S22+	I received my Galaxy S22+ in white around 6 days back and I've been facing a ton of issues relating to battery drain(3-4 hours SOT), getting around 60% of expected benchmark scores across 3DMark and Geekbench, and the phone's taking over 2 hours to charge from 0 to 100% even with the 45w charger.

Ways to speed up Galaxy S22 5G?	I noticed a couple times throughout the day my phone will bog down and take 30 seconds or so to catch back up.

Same when I play a game, mainly MaplestoryM, phone will slow down during normal game play to very low FPS.

Is my signal booster outdated or do I need to alter some settings?	R
Galaxy S22 video player not resuming where I left off the way my S8 did	"I recently Upgraded from a Galaxy S8 to an S22 Ultra. 
On the S8 I would download and watch long podcast videos, and when I paused the video and closed the app, when I came back and opened the video through the gallery it would resume where I left off in the video player.
On the S22 Ultra however, it starts the video over everytime and I have to scroll through and find where I was (the videos are several hours long so this can be a hassle). I already used Gallery Labs to turn off the Filmstrip, but even with the Play video button back it doesnt resume the video where I left off last.
Anyone know how to fix this?"	R
Faded/blue-green blacks in low brightness	My screen has started displaying very faded blacks when the brightness is very low. The blacks are often a green/blue hue and not dark at all. The screen is fine in normal brightness during the day but is almost unusable at night as there is little contrast and everything is muddied.I am using eye protection and sometimes extra dim mode. The issue persists even when I turn off both. If I raise the brightness at night it fixes the problem but it's uncomfortable to read at night with high brightness.The issue persists across apps, it comes and goes randomly. Sometimes it corrects itself for five minutes but then goes back for the rest of the night. Restarting doesn't fix the issue. Haven't tried a factory reset.When I take a screenshot and send to another device the screenshot looks normal (deep blacks, correct hues).	R
Insane battery drain with youtube	I'm so tired of my samsung phones giving me problems.I had a note 20 ultra that I traded in and bought an s22 ultra even though I was completely fine with the note because youtube was draining so much battery, and there was just such poor battery life after the 4.1 update. Here I am on my s22 ultra typing this losing more battery than I was typing my post from when I had issues with my note 20 ultra.What is going on? Why did 20 minutes of youtube just drain my battery from 74 percent to 63. **bleep**? I just unplugged my phone from topping it off a bit and I'm already almost through the charge I just gave it?Does youtube premium use more battery?What am I supposed to do? I'm on the snapdragon version of the s22 ultra. Didn't use smart switch.	R

There are certain times when I have to minimize whatever app I'm using in order to open my panel, and I shouldn't have to do that. The purpose of the panel is so that you don't have to do that... At least it used to be that way. Is anyone else having this issue? And there is no "appear on top" toggle for the Edge panel either.	R

Microphone quality at high volume	"Anyone else give their S22 Ultra a test ride with video recording at a heavy metal concert? 
The into for the Judas Priest concert last week was awesome in person but listening to the video is awful. Horrible clipping during the very bassy pre-recorded intro.  At about the:22 mark you can hear the clipping for the remainder of the pre-recorded intro but less as the band begins to play live but still present.   
This thread over at XDA seems to point out it being a software issue. https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/h...t-club.4408391 
FYI, I've seen other cell phone recordings of the very same intro and they sound just fine.  Seems the S22 Ultra really can't handle the bass.  Thoughts?"	R

Stock RAW overexposed and blurry	"I have the Snapdragon S22U fully updated n all. The stock camera works great and everything's nice sharp and punchy but i tried the pro mode RAW and expert RAW and im kinda disappointed. The stock RAW is almost always overexposed even with settings adjusted and has this weird color tint (blue skies look kinda purple) and most of all, its always blurry compared to the viewfinder and the stock jpg and even expert RAW. The expert RAW lacks some details compared to the stock cam too but atleast the colors look the most balanced and its not too blurry or overexposed. 
Is this a software problem? Or am i just doing smth wrong here? I can edit well and take great photos so its not that. I've seen loads of people posting their expert RAW shots and they look so detailed and crisp."	R

Battery Help	"I know this topic is white washed, but please help.
Woke this morn with 85 percent and within half hour dropped to 75 percent... Have not been doing much other then scrolling on Reddit here! 😉
I have heard some say, the battery improves after some weeks of use, is this actually true? I would consider myself a moderate to heavy user. I enjoy streaming Netflix and YouTube, watching videos in general. I use social media frequently and also I am using the s pen all the time. 
Note: I already have FHD on and other ""battery saving "" features so to speak applied in my settings. I would eventually like to gain the full experience of this magical device.
Any advice at all is much much appreciated!❤️"	R

I did a battery test on my S22 Ultra. Should I be worried about these results (screenshots included)?	"So yesterday morning I took my phone (S22 Ultra, unlocked, US version, Snapdragon) off the charger at 10 in the morning with 100% battery life. I had the brightness set to around 75-80%, motion smoothness to Adaptive (120 hz), screen resolution at WQHD+ (3088 x 1440) and connected to WiFi all day (my wifi is very good and phone receives good signal).  I used my phone until the charge dropped to 5%. Here are the results.
&amp;#x200B;
[SOT 7h 6 m](https://preview.redd.it/8i8mbtj9ips81.jpg?width=955&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6bee937d387fc15678c4743dfbdf2ad7f0f3a477)
&amp;#x200B;
I took this screenshot once the battery was at 5%. Although I don't think this data is entirely accurate because I remember checking this about 10 minutes prior to taking this screenshot and it still said 7 h 6 m SOT. I think this next screenshot has more accurate data.
&amp;#x200B;
[SOT 7 h 23 m](https://preview.redd.it/yvya8j5mips81.jpg?width=955&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=049237eff7ca3c3728ca6b91ff746f2e22dc7be5)
Now 7 h 23 m doesn't look all that bad. After all, it's on par with what most phone reviewers on youtube are saying about their battery life. So I'm quite happy with this. But I do have 1 concern which I will mention shortly. Before that, here are some more observations and details:
When scrolling facebook, the charge drops by 1% around every 3 minutes.
When using Quick Share to import files from another phone, the charge drops by 1% around every 6 minutes.
When streaming on disney+, the charge drops by 1% around every 8 minutes.
I first turned on this phone on April 5 and this test was done on April 9. As you can see from the screenshots, the phone did not have an estimated usage time and it was still learning my usage patterns. Although I think it finally finished learning my usage patterns because when I woke up this morning (April 10), it said ""A full charge will last about 10h"".
Now regarding my concern, as you can see, the battery drains quite fast when scrolling through facebook. A 1% drop every 3 minutes. To me that doesn't look very good. Theoretically, this means if I used only facebook and no other apps, my phone wouldn't even last 5 hours. At first I assumed it's probably because facebook is very UI-based and as I'm scrolling through my feed, the phone is constantly displaying new content on the screen and this takes a lot of battery power. So I put this theory to the test by installing instagram and scrolling through my feed. Now with instagram, I got a 1% battery drop around every 7 minutes, which is vastly different from what I observed with facebook. This is a little concerning because facebook is the app I use the most. And with a 5000 mAh battery, I expected better (I was hoping for 1% drop every 7 minutes for facebook).
Now my question to you guys is... Is this normal? Is facebook supposed to eat up battery this fast? Did any of you guys have similar experience using facebook on your S22 Ultra (with the same settings that I described above)?
Also what are your thoughts on the estimated 10 h that the phone is showing me? Does this 10h refer to the usage time or SOT? Should I be worried about this? Is it going to stay at 10h all the time or will it continue to re-adjust based on my usage patterns?
Thanks in advance."	R
Problems with External DAC. Any tips?	"I have a slightly niche DAC/DAP called the Lotoo 6000. On my s21 it worked perfectly, I would plug it in, select ""phone DAC"" on the DAC and the audio would work just fine.
This no longer is the case. On my s22 the everything seems to be working fine, but no audio comes out of the DAC. It seems the s22 is not sending any audio out of the USB port (at least not in a way the DAC can understand).
I think it is important to note that the DAC works on my tab s7 running OneUI 4.0.
Had anyone else experienced this? Is it related to the DAC issues on pixels?"	R
Hi, I've enabled Bixby Routine's which is about reading aloud specific notification but it doesn't work. How can I solve it ?	"My goal with this routine is to know the content of messages of a specific person as soon as my phone receives it if I'm wearing my buds pro. The issue is that most of the time I wear my buds pro to listen to music when walking on the street or traveling in bus but Bixby doesn't wanna read messages from this friend because my screen is locked.
What I don't understand is that I remember on my S7 Edge (using custom rom with OneUI 2.1) and on my Note 9, I was able to use more Bixby functions on lock screen. 
Is it possible that the issue comes from the fact I'm using Google Messages instead of Samsung Messages ? In thus case, why is Samsung providing Google Messages as default SMS app in some regions as they are limiting their user's features ? If thus is not the reason, why so ? Is there a privacy setting I missed somewhere ? 
Thanks for your help in advance 😉"	R

22 Ultra Fingerprint Scanner stopped working on day 14	"Hello! I preordered my S22 Ultra on launch day and got it a couple days early. Swapped from a S9 to S22 Ultra. I loved it. On day 14 my fingerprint scanner stopped working- I don't mean that it isn't reading the fingerprint- it says ""operation canceled"" and won't even attempt to read a print. I called Samsung and we tried EVERYTHING including a factory reset as a last resort. Nothing helped. 
The Samsung guy remoted in and ran diagnostics and told me that the hardware of the scanner itself was fine. He claims that it's a software issue and the phone needs reflashed. I argued that they needed to just replace the whole phone since it had only been 14 days. They claimed that they didn't have the ability to. They wanted to send it off to Samsung and be without a phone for 2 weeks. (I work in a hospital, this is just not an option). I know they want to clone the phone so they can replicate the bug and that's great, but if they want the bugged phone, I felt like they should send me a new one and keep this one. Which they insisted they couldn't do. So they said I could get it reflashed at a local Samsung certified service center. The service center has been trying to download the BIOS for a month now and Samsung has not made it available yet.
After the factory reset I was not able to register the fingerprints again. 2 weeks ago, I tried and it worked for a few minutes, but not long enough to register a fingerprint. Which brings me to last night when I was able to register 4 fingerprints and use them for around 3 hours before bed. Wake up this morning to it not working again (though at least my prints are registered now). Important information tho: my phone is set to restart every night at 3am.
So my questions: is anyone else having this problem? With it working on occasion, is it possible that it is a software bug? Wouldn't that make it a hardware problem?"	R
Weak vibration and pattern changes	"So, very happy with my S22+, but the vibration is hopeless. I cannot feel it even in jeans in a silent office landscape. So, if anyone has any ideas on how to remedy this it'd be greatly appreciated. The option to add a pseudo-vibration on incoming calls helps somewhat, but obviously doesn't do anything for notifications. Samsung: Please increase the strength of the vibration, or add a vibro-sound to notifications as well.
So, my second issue. I've set the longest and imho best vibration pattent for notifications. But when my phone is in ""vibration only"" mode I only get a very short pattern. So it doesn't stick. Is this only on my phone, or has anyone else had this issue as well?"	R
Theme Park custom icon selection crash	"Theme Park now allows us to use third-party icon packs from the play store and we can also change each individual icon separately.
However, when I have selected an icon pack to use and I tried to click on the ""change individual icon"" option in the three dots menu, the theme park just crashes or turns into a black screen before returning to the default + create new page. Fortunately, when not selecting an icon pack first and clicking on ""change individual icon"" immediately, it works and the theme park doesn't crash at all.
Has anyone encountered a similar issue that can share some insights? On 1UI 4.1 April patch, many thanks."	R

The main camera lens (not the 3x zoom one) takes blurry pictures like it's out of focus between 2.5x and 2.9x, is this normal ? — S22 Ultra	"I take a picture at 2.5x or 2.9x and it's really blurry and out of focus. When I make it 3x from 2.9x, it focuses correctly with the zoom lens. The problem doesn't exist on 1x, it just happens between 2.5x - 2.9x. Is this normal ? It not happening on 1x but just happening between 2.5x - 2.9x confuses me since it's the same lens.
Tldr: the pictures and focus is blurry between 2.5x - 2.9x."	R
Potential Camera Issue	"I got the S22 a couple days ago, and started using it properly today. However, I noticed with the camera that when I go to take a photo about 1/3 of it is somewhat unfocused, which is pretty annoying. Is this a software issue/because it's still new, or is this a hardware issue? Or is this how the camera's meant to be? 
The point of the photo where I actively focus it is perfectly sharp, it's just towards the edges of the photo that are more unfocused."	R

Very poor battery life	Before "upgrading" to the S22 Ultra I had an S20 Ultra. Both units were upgraded to Android 12. The battery drain and overall battery life of the S22 Ultra as compared to the S20 Ultra is horrific.I am fully aware of all the optimization settings, potential app issues, etc.However the S20 Ultrahad far superior battery life with the same set of apps and the same OS.I suppose I could wipe the cache partition or reset the phone. Neither of which should be needed. One mistake I may have made is using Smart Switch.Samsung customer support is mediocre at best.

Turn off chat in Samsung Messages and it sends fine. Turn Chat back on, back to blurry.

Strange Outline Font	I am two days in on my new s22 ultra, I have previously owned note devices, and have been an android user for around 10 years, I find the phone really buggy, even after all the updates, getting my apps over from my previous OnePlus 9 Pro was a disaster, so had to install each app separately, now I like Samsung and their phones, so I am not here to knock Samsung, but I find my phone doesn't function as well as the OnePlus 9 Pro, the UI is much more refined, more robust.Once particulur issue is driving me insane, is the font, if I select a dark theme for WhatsApp, I get this outlined hollow text, which I difficult to read, I find it appears on some news articles also, and starts off normal font and then transitions into this hollow font after a few words,It's taken me a day and a half to set this phone up, and while a reset may be the answer, I wondered if anyone else has experienced this issue, I also find trying to send pictures from Google drive to WhatsApp just crashes the phone.I look forward to any replies, and thank you for taking the time to read my post.

S22 Ultra Camera Flashlight flickering on video recordings	My recordings have flickering caused by the flashlight LED on my S22.Visually in real time it looks fine, and compared to my S20 Ultra, the LED light emits light fine... But the recording turns out bad.Now... I can use my S20 Ultra flashlight instead and the video records perfect, but when I use the built-in S22 flashlight, this flickering happens.I shut the LED off on the last second	R

Network issues	My phone keeps disconnecting from mobile data, i never had this issue before. I have a YouTube premium subscription which allows me to keep listening a video or a live stream even though my screen is off (stand by mode) but the audio keeps stopping every 90 seconds. When this happens i press the power button to just get the screen on (still lock) and the audio starts automatically again, then it stops again after 60 seconds or so.

My S22 ultra has horizontal lines	Recently I noticed my galaxy has horizontal lines running across the screen when you touch the display. This only happens on the 120 refresh rate. Any one else have this issue and what did you do? I'm not sure if it's a faulty display or software.	R
Anyone else having issues that Samsung won't address? How can we get through?	I've submitted these within the error reports section and they ask for a log even when I have the send logs button checked. They kept saying they didnt recieve logs so I kept resending the logs and they still act like they didnt get them. They are clearlyjust giving me the run around. Besides most of the issues I tried to address are performance related or software downgrades by Samsung, not some crash report.The camera on these flagships are the biggest changes every year and reason customers continue to choose Samsung or Apple, the 2 leading companies for smartphones. The performance must be top notch! I have informed Samsung in the error reports which seems to do nothing as my issue is marked "answered".S22 camera stutters every video within first 5 seconds of recording. So I must settle with missing quick moments I want to record or having the first 5 seconds of it be a trash video. The shutter isn't instant like it was on my S10+. Ive tested with different resolutions and it's definitely slower.It's also much slower with switching apps using the recents button. After turning off animations in developer settings and in Nova launcher there is still a 2-3 second delay with double tapping recents. This action used to be instant in older versions of android so there is no good reason for this decline.Split screen mode has been downgraded as well, when I have a video playing on the top window (no pin to top function anymore), pressing recents button will just switch out of both apps and not keep my the video playing at the top like in previous galaxy phones. The only work around is to use the edge menu predefined app pairs or switch apps from there. Less natural feeling and convenient than pressing recents button so I see no good reason for removing this function. Also switching with edge menu covers the video I'm trying to watch in the background.	R
Generally underwhelmed	I got the S22 Ultra and I was so excited leading up to it. Even got the Buds2 with it. But it has barely been a month and I have to send my Buds2 in because the left bud isn't working properly and have already had to contact support for the S22 Ultra as well. And my dim fluctuates and brightens on apps like gallery. I'm just super disappointed by my this purchase. It feels especially annoying because at the same time I lost the SD card slot and headphone jack. I wanted so hard to love Samsung and get into the ecosystem. But I don't know about that choice anymore	R
S22 will not connect fully to Active 2 watch	I've been trying for days to sync my active 2 watch to my new Galaxy s22. It's failed every time. I've reset the watch, deleted galaxy wearable app and reinstalled it, rebooted my phone and still it won't connect. What can I do to make it work?	R

Unsupported audio file	Recently, my alarm sound has not been going off in the morning to wake me up for work, and when I went into the alarm app to figure out why, an error message pops up saying "unsupported audio file".

S22 Ultra "Camera Failed"	Has anyone gotten an error "camera failed" when trying to take a picture. I was zoomed approximately 3.5x and everytime I would click the capture button I would get the error Camera Failed. Prior to this I've never had any issues with the camera at all.	R
My S22ultra charging slow	My 10 days old SD S22 ultra charging with 25w is slow taking around 90 minutes to reach 100% from 12% which is not same as 68 minutes claim by Samsung.I tried closing all background apps, clicked optimize in battery section but it's same.It's somewhat inconsistent too. One day it took 2 hour the other day with 75 minutes.	R
22 Ultra update failing phone	Is anybody else experienced any issues since the last update with either the charging not charging it would show up and then disappear back and forth as well as sometimes it wouldn't charge at all it would be in USB mode or problems with the screen even not shutting off you are cursing with your own free will or sometimes non-responsive there's a bunch of other things that I've noticed I even went to have the phone repaired under warranty because of these but I think I might have just being a bunch of bugs from the last update	R

Samsung throttling - No phone of the year	"I really had high hopes that this was going to make at least a few reviewer's lists for top phone of the year.  Not sure what award it will receive given this scandal. LOL.  Go back with me perhaps some of you were like me when you first heard about Samsung's throttling through the Game Optimizer app.  When I first got the notification to turn on the Game Optimizing app I was skeptical. Why do I need an app to optimize my games?  I thought they were optimizing searching for games by putting them all in one place making it easier for me to find them even though I was already putting them in a game folder.  I did like seeing my stats and later some of the instant play games were kind of a novelty and while I never really got what the point was it became an easy habit to fall into.  
Fast forward, 2022 and Game Optimizer is revealed to be a throttling app.  Not only suppressing game performance but also suppressing regular apps that might push the limits.  When I first head about this I wasn't overly concerned.  The device still did everything I wanted it to do and did it without any hitches or hiccups.  And if it was doing it to preserve some battery, something we've all been concerned about at one time or another, no harm no foul, right?  Then following closely on the heels of that epiphany all of the bad that started showing up.  Bans from benchmark apps and sites, rumors that sales were taking a hit due to this and a rushed patch, which was supposed to give us back control but really didn't give the control promised.   
I'm not saying that I regret my purchase, I really wanted the built in S-Pen and the other upgrades, although few from the S21, that came with this new device.  What about you?  Have these revelations changed your opinion about your purchase?  If you'd known about this prior to buying would you have passed on this device?  Does this make you trust Samsung any less and what will that mean for your relationship with them moving forward?"	R
Does anyone have this strange issue when you get below 10%, the battery literally drains a percent every minute until it dies	I have good battery life at above 6 hours SOT so idk if it's the software reporting such a bad battery percentage but I've just drained my battery completely, was at 25 percent down to 10% with like around an hour and 45 minutes sot but once I went below 10%, the battery literally drained immediately.

My phone is randomly getting hot.	"It does not matter what I'm doing, I have moments where my phone goes from a normal temperature to getting hot out of nowhere. I clear the ram and then it stops rising and starts to go back down but this is something that happens a lot and I can't always clear the ram.
This was not happening before the March update btw. I think there is something causing this that closes when I clear the ram and shut down the background processes. I did not download anything after the March update that could be causing this. Has anyone else been experiencing this and does anyone have a potential solution?"	R

S22 base model. How to improve fingerprint reader accuracy and speed?	"Coming from an S8.  The S8's fingerprint reader is **night-and-day better** than the reader of the S22.
***I could unlock my phone simply by feel.***  Didn't even have to look at the phone.  I could unlock it as I was pulling it out of my pocket and have the phone ready for use before I even raised it to normal usage height.
With the S22, I have to pull out the phone first and look at the screen to hit the reader area.  And even when I hit it properly, it will read my print accurately less than 50% of the time on first ""jab"".
Who thought this was a better method??!?
Anyhow, if anyone has any tips on improving the speed and accuracy of unlocking the phone by fingerprint, I'd be thankful."	R

S22 update	So far has the galaxy S22 Ultra for a few weeks. So far loving it. Only issues I've really had is the finger print reader being finicky. And the face recognition unlock being a little nit picky about what's the perfect view and what isn't. Other than that battery lasts me all day with as much as I use this thing. End up with 35% battery by time I get home from work. Games work well. Honestly not much to gripe about. Love the pen. And the latency from 9 to 2 sec is spot on. Works very smoothly.	R

Autorotate + YouTube Navbar Bug	Has anyone else experienced a bug where returning from landscape mode to portrait while using YouTube results in the navigation buttons ending up at the top of the screen? It's really bizarre and doesn't happen all the time. Was hoping that last update would fix it. I do have a bixby routine configured to enable autorotate when YouTube is open, so while I wouldn't think that would matter, I suppose it could.The screenshot doesn't show very well, but you can just barely see the bottom three navigation buttons AT THE TOP of the screen. To fix this, I have to rotate back to landscape, then to portrait again.	R

Defective new S22+ out of the box - Media Speakers broken	Per the multiple other posts starting to appear on this forum, I am reporting in with the S22(+) Media speaker crackling distorting issue. As others have mentioned, there are extremely limited temporary work arounds, such as factory resetting or general settings reset, but those last about half an hour before the issue occurs again. I have also found that holding and pressing my finger above the finger print scanner makes the issue go away, until I remove my finger. Frankly speaking, how did this pass QA?My phone is 6 days old and still under the 14 day warranty. I immediately put a screen protector on and a phone case right when I received it. After being tossed around on the Samsung support lines for over 3 hours and only being able to speak to "supervisors" in the Philippines, the only resolution was to spend another GRAND on creating a new order, waiting for that phone to arrive, and then returning the defective phone. You would think that a defective phone caused by Samsung, sent to a customer, and having the customer spend countless hours of support would be enough to simply send a new working phone to keep the customer satisfied before needing to have the customer send back the defective phone. Samsung used to simply exchange phones in this scenario back when I had the S9+.People need to be forewarned that Samsung e-commerce website has ZERO defective exchange policy (they said this themselves) and therefore do not put the customer first. You will pay valuable time and money if you buy a new product from Samsung dot com.	R
BUGS April 2022 Patch - Spotify Stops Playing Music When Display is Off	I recently noticed that the April 2022 patch brought some bugs. I'll put some detail into it below:1. Spotify stops playing in the background when display is off. I noticed that the spotify/media notification keeps on getting killed at least a minute after the screen is turned off. This doesn't happen on the March 2022 patch. Tried to reinstall the application and also to reformat the phone to rule out application issues but the behavior remained the same.2. On a newly patched phone, some applications are not showing up in the recent applications menu. Though they are still running in the background. Reinstalling the applications fixes this issue but this would be a real hassle if you have lots of applications installed prior to the April 2022 patch.3. Samsung messages notifications are stacking improperly on the recent patch:The screenshot should show what's happening so I would not give more details on it 😉Hope that this gets fixed or patched soon.One UI Version: 4.1Android: 12Build number: SP1A.210812.016.S908EXXU1AVCJAndroid security patch level: April 1, 2022Current Version: S908EXXU1AVCJ/S908EOXM1AVCJ/S908EXXU1AVCJ	R

Still won't send as a chat, have to switch to SMS. AT&T is my carrier. Any help would be greatly appreciated, but for some reason I'm thinking it's a software issue that needs addressed from either Samsung, Google, AT&T or all three.	R

Anyone feel like phone and apps run super slow or don't work at all?	"Sorry if someone has already posted about this, I didn't see it on a quick scroll thru the sub tho. 
Anyways, these last few weeks I feel like the phone is just SO slow, whether I'm on wifi or not (I'm constantly having to flip it on and off to see if it'll help things but it usually doesnt). Half the time pages/apps don't load or aren't working properly and glitching out. 
I know some of that might be on the apps end ofc, but it just seems to be getting worse and worse. Sometimes I swear it's like my phone doesn't even have service, but everyone around me is fine lol. 
Snapchat and Spotify have been the WORST the last few days, but again, im the only one having issues. Like for example, yesterday snap kept freezing on the send screen or coming up blank, and then I tried closing the app and the video sound still played non stop until I literally restarted my phone, it was so weird. Spotify doesn't let me start playing songs, or it does and then you can't access what's playing. 
Again, I know a lot of issues I'm experiencing are app related, but im curious if anyone else is seeing stuff like this!"	R

Periscope cam makes a "micro" Thud..	"Phone fell from door handle height, on its face. I have a ringke fusion clear case so there isnt even a scratch on the phone. 
Afterwards i noticed an audible rattle when choosing the 10x cam  *am fully aware of the OIS rattle thing, this is different*. I can *feel* it very clearly in the main camera area and even hear it when I rotate the phone to answer a call. it's kinda like a ""micro"" thud. In contrast to hear the OIS rattle you have to deliberately shake the phone.
Samsung service center dismissed it as the OIS rattle and asked to keep the phone to further check it. I tried the demo units there, they do NOT rattle the same way.
Now, the camera shots are perfectly fine and stabilized, but the ""thud"" when i try to talk on the phone really gets on my nerves; am going to replace the camera module for now. had planned to keep the phone for several years and this fragile periscope is not really confidence inspiring."	R

voLTE not working properly although my carrier has it and i enabled it through settings (I see the logo but whenever I receive a call my internet data shuts off)
with April update, I started getting ghost touches.
so should I replace it? or are you guys having some of these issues too?"	R
I just got my s22 ultra and the battery is so bad. is it happening to anybody else ??		R
S22 Ultra (Unlocked) rebooting issues	Anyone else having problems with their S22 Ultra rebooting? I've noticed it happens when the Sim card is installed in the phone. Like when I first received the phone I did the new phone setup and transferred all my data from my old phone and had no issues then I inserted the sim card and restarted the phone and it kept restarting for about 2 hours then stopped. It stopped around 4am and that's when I went to sleep since I work at 2:48pm. Was fine when I woke up so I took it to work but at 730pm while I was using my phone just doing normal stuff like listening to music and on the internet or facebook can't remember which but anyway it started restarting again. I got home around 12am and took the sim card out and put it in my old phone cause of course it still works. S22 stopped restarting around 1am and worked fine after that. It's now 24 hours later and I insert my sim card after work and it instantly started the reboot cycle for maybe 30 min to an hour and is fine now. I made a claim so I could get a new one but was curious if anyone knew what I could do if their is anything I could do to fix this weird issue.	R
S22 Plus only giving me 4.5 hours of Screen On Time a day… is my battery faulty?	"I use discord a lot. Whenever I use it, my phone gets really hot and battery drains like 1% every 2-3 minutes. Is this normal? When I use discord on my iPad it barely breaks a sweat. 
Wondering if anyone else is facing the same issue…"	R
Galaxy S22 Ultra apps update issue	Just received my S22 Ultra and transfer all my data from my old phone to it, but it won't update 36 of my application. It's been more than a hour and there is no chance. I updated my s22 firmware to the latest version but it is still no change on downloading and updating the rest of the apps.	R
Media Volume is turning itself down	I've been noticing that my media volume is turning itself down. Was watching a show and after unpausing it it sounded quieter and another instance happend while listening to a podcast...Curious if anyone else is experiencing something similar.	R
Lag	Every time I join discord it makes every other app extremely slow and laggy is that just me? I just got the s22 ultra a week a ago.	R
Speakerphone Echo	Samsung Ultra 22Every time I'm on the phone or on a video call, using speaker, my voice echos. The person I am talking to says it echos my voice really badly and they can't understand me. I do not hear it and their voice seems fine. It's very frustrating as I use speakerphone or face chat my friends via duo or Facebook messenger often.	R
Music skipping problem	Playing song with s22+ the last 10-15 seconds is skipped. Whats the problem?	R
Weak wifi	I was reading many articles about the S22 ultra having wifi problems but apparently it also affects the S22 plus.At home my Note 20 ultra has very good wifi signal and very bad 5g signal and now the S22 plus is just the opposite.	R
"Connected Without Internet" is back!	I had the "Connected Without Internet" problem when my S22 Ultra was connected (or at least supposedly connected) to my ASUS RT-AX86U router, starting a week or so after I received the phone in late February. Not very frequently; certainly not every few minutes as some people reported, but frequently enough to be irritating. I tried setting my IP settings to "Static", which seemed to settle the problem for a few days, then it recurred, so I set it back to DHCP and set my MAC address to "Phone MAC".That seemed to settle the problem quite nicely. I did that round the same time that I applied the March 31 update, so I wasn't entirely sure whether it was changing the MAC address or whether it was the update, but I wasn't terribly worried as the problem was solved.And now I've installed the 12th April update, and almost instantly the "Connected Without Internet" problem is back. It happened as soon as the phone rebooted after installing the update and it's happened a further four times since then. That's a lot more frequently than I've experienced it previously.Were any proof needed that this error is a consequence of a dodgy bit of software implementation by Samsung, I think we have it. So pull your fingers out Samsung and fix this problem.	R
Lagging	Just switched from a galaxy s20 ultra to a galaxy s22 ultra and it really sucks. My s22 ultra is lagging alot non stop but my s20 ultra works so much better. Sooo disappointed 😞 . Never had these problems with my s10 plus either. So I wamt to return it and just keep the old. Can I take the phone back after 30 days??	R
Charging while wirelessly power sharing	Samsung is not allowing users to power share and charge at the same time, as of on the s22 ultra.	R
The Reason Behind Ghost Touch in S22 .	Hi AllAfter many tests done to see what is behind the Ghost Touch we are experiencing , i believe it is because of Turning on the Power Saver. Many confirmed the same.Hope to see an effective response from Samsung to fix this.	R
s pen doesn't connect?	When i first got the phone 5 weeks ago i put spen air commands off to save battery but now my battery is fine. I wanted to use air commands but it wouldt connect to my phone, it will buffer and then say spen not found no matter how many time i retry. Does anyone know how to fix this?	R
S22U S pen button won't take pics.	"Newbie to the stylus pen here. 
From the moment I received the S22U, the stylus button clicks, but won't take a picture or do anything else for that matter, at any distance. The clicking itself feels perfect just don't understand it at all.
Also when I take the pen out, it only works within the few S pen menu apps, I can't write anywhere on it like advertised. 🤷😕
EDIT: Air actions are on and single click is set to take pictures
Any help appreciated."	R
Apps directing me to my files instead my gallery	"So I just upgraded from my S9+ to the S22 Ultra and I've had so many issues when it comes to sending stuff from my gallery to discord for example. 
Everytime I try to search for an image or video to send it just directs me to my files app and doesn't even bother giving me the option to do it from my gallery. Are there any fixes at all for this? It's really starting to irritate me"	R
Question about the S22 Ultra	Hi! My family recently gifted my dad an S22 Ultra. Recently it started randomly hitting the home button or typing an extra letter. I was wondering what may be the cause of this and if others have the same issue. Thank you!	R

I think i just experienced some kind of bug	"So i was just casually scrolling and watching ig reels and then i went to the home page, for some reason i can't open any app folder nor can i swipe up to open the app drawer, i pulled down the notification tray it did go down but i can't open any notification, i tried doing the swipe up to home and it registers. Tried locking and unlocking fingerprint works but when i unlock i still cant open any app folder nor any apps. 
I reatarted the phone and all is good, hopefully it won't happen again"	R

Is there a way to stop image over-saturation?	I really love the S22U, Seems like an amazing phone however the unrealistic image processing is just not my thing. Is there a way to disable the over-saturation and color blowing?	R
S22 Ultra refresh rate problem?	i downloaded a refresh rate checker and noticed that it goes down to 24hz for like a second and goes back to 120. and keeps doing that all the time. it doesnt go down to 24 hz and stay there when i dont interact with the screen, but instantly goes back to 120 hz, then down to 24 hz for a sec and back up to 120 hz. is it normal? am i the only one with this problem ? might explain why so many people are having bad battery lives.

OTG not detected. plz help	Hi Guys. My phone is not detecting otg adapter. The adapter works fine on laptop but it doesn't receive power when used on phone. Do i need to enable anything in settings? Thanks in advance	R
thought it was getting better till I realized my SOT time. Idk but feel like 3 hours is just not enough. Felt like I got more battery life or the same amount from my base model s21.		R
My lockscreen settings keep changing?	I have the s22 ultra 512gb. On my lockscreen I have the left shortcut set to camera. But after a day, it seems to disappear. The camera shortcut is gone and when I go to settings &gt; lockscreen, the shortcut toggle is off. Why is this happening?	R
Ram Plus issues?	So I know in theory, the ram plus option is supposed to help speed up your phone in demanding situations. So I had it set to 8gb of ram plus used. And my phone kept being laggy and glitchy when switching between apps or anything of the sorts. Stuff that none of my galaxy S or Note series have ever had issues with. So I decided to try and set the ram plus to use only 2gb and ever since I've done this, my phone has been running much more efficiently without a hiccup. Has anybody else came across this yet? I'm just trying to see if it's just me? Or?	R

adaptive battery	"Is adaptive battery doing good for yall? I'm sometimes confused by it because I notice the power saving is on sometimes while using my phone at a usual time I normally do. 
I have yet to see power saving mode on while I'm sleeping. 
I go to bed about the same time every night but wake up at different times. 
I even check to see if power saving is on when I wake up to use the bathroom to find that it's not on.

Dropping Calls and GPS Issues	"Posted a couple weeks ago and haven't had any luck resolving, so I'm posting again.
Base Galaxy S22, US Verizon version. Still having issues with calls dropping, sudden loss of service, and spotty GPS, even when not on power saving mode. Today is 21 days from when the phone arrived, and I'm wondering what to do. My phone is fully up to date, I've tried network resets, and Verizon has told me it's not an issue with the Sim card.
I use my phone for work and can't keep having issues like this. Do I need to return this phone? Will the replacement work any better? Will I be without a phone for several days or even weeks? Took me a long time to finally be willing to upgrade from my S10E and I'm massively regretting it. My phone doesn't even properly do the one thing it's supposed to do, make phone calls and send texts.
Appreciate the help and support in advance. Really hoping to find a solution that doesn't make me wish I'd bought a Pixel instead."	R
S22 Ultra - Chrome logout issue? (Anyone else encounter this?)	"Hi,
A friend just got an S22 Ultra. They signed in to their Gmail account and used SmartSwitch to move everything over from their S20 FE. It worked 99% great, but they're encountering a weird bug. Chrome is constantly logging them out of all their accounts. It's like it's wiping cookies constantly.
I have dug through the settings app and settings menu (in Chrome) methodically, and found nothing that would cause that. I uninstalled/reinstalled Chrome, and same problem. I now have them on Vivaldi, which is working fine. We're just wondering why chrome is buggered? Could it be a side effect of using smart switch? Would a wipe do the trick? They'd prefer to have Chrome working so that everything syncs nicely with their PC. (Or I guess I could move them to Vivaldi there, too?)
Ideas/input appreciated.
Cheers,"	R
Message not coming out of archived when receiving new message	Anybody else have this problem? Within the last week, if someone texts me (default Messages app) and they were Archived, I'll get a notification but when I tap on it, it just brings me to the Messages app - it doesn't even bring that person out of Archived and I have to go dig around in the Archive to find the new text. It's gotta be a bug, no?	R
S22+ Camera Lag Issue	"Hello, 
So I have the s22+ and I noticed that when I turn the camera to a place where the lights are off, the camera starts to lag. I mean I am not talking about when I am taking a photo but just when I am holding and moving the phone when the camera app is open, it just lags. 
I just wanted to know if anyone else has this problem.
Thanks."	R
S22 Ultra Brightness Issue	Hey friends. Having an issue with screen brightness. When I drag the brightness slider up to about 3/4 of the way, the screen stops getting brighter. Adaptive brightness is off, eye comfort shield is off. Increase brightness button doesn't do anything. Not sure what the issue could be. Out of the box it was working well. But after about a week I've noticed it no longer works. Any thoughts?	R
Can't connect Insta360 One X2 via USB to S22 Ultra	Hey all, I'm coming from a 2 year old OnePlus 8 Pro that works fine with the Insta360 One X2.The S22 ultra is giving me all kinds of issues connecting via USB. Wifi connection works, but it's too slow to transfer 30 GB files.My Insta360 is set to USB Android mode, and it works fine on my other phone, but when I plug it into the S22 Ultra, the camera beeps that it's been connected, then the camera shuts down like the phone shut off the port. When the App is not open, in the notification area the S22 shows a high powered USB device was connected and that it can't charge it. The OnePlus 8 Pro charges the camera normally and can connect to transfer files via USB normally.Does anyone else use this phone and camera combo that can offer advice? To me itlooks like a bug with the USB port on the phone.	R
Bluetooth in car issues	I just got my s22 ultra. Connected it to my car. YouTube videos and Spotify are garbled. Broken... Like bad reception. I let it go for 20 minutes and at some points it would be crystal clear but that last no more than 10 seconds.Phone calls are fine though. Texted support and they recommended doing a data whip but I don't wanna lose my texts that I transfered before my old phone died. Plus not sure if that would work if call audio is fine it's just other (only tested YouTube and Spotify)any advice pleaseSolved!Go to Solution.	R
S22 Ultra screen timeout when on a call	I have an S22 Ultra and when I get on a call, whether I'm on my bluetooth, or speaker, or hold the phone to my ear, the screen goes dark and I have to hit the power button to display the screen in order to hang up. I've Google'd this and keep finding settings that my phone doesn't seem to have (proximity setting, for one). Can someone point me in the right direction? I just performed a software update (4/14/22) to make sure I'm on the most current release.	R
Very fast battery drain	I have a S22 ultra and the battery drains very quickly when it's full charged it drops off 100% in a minute or two and even today it dropped 3% in 13 minutes of on screen time with barely any use mostly in the home screen. I tried adaptive battery, and closing all apps but still the same drain even while doing nothing.	R
SYNC will not pair with my car	I had my S22 Ultra paired to my car. I accidentally unpaired. Now it will not pair again.	R
Annoying waiting call dialog that delays from switching to another call until they hang up :-(	Well you know the drill. You get a call from your wife when driving while you already talk to a friend. So you answer the waiting call. On every AOSP rom it switches to the new call and puts your friend on hold. But not on Samsung. They think they know "better". A second before they connect you to your wife a dialog pops up. You need to decide if you want to end the current call and switch to the waiting call or maybe you want to put the current call on hold and switch to the new call. Oh boy, the dialog is small and hard to press on - and it's dangerous to do while driving 😞 ! So it takes me some time to press (especially when I look out for trafic and answer the call from the stearing wheel). Of course, wife already ended the call as it took me too long to answer. And my friend is also asking what is going on as I told him to wait a bit as I need to talk to my wife.Anyone knows how to get the default Google behaviour ? So when I answer my incoming call it will not ask me anything and put the current call on hold ? There is no switch for this or a key in the system. Maybe a bixby routing ? Sometimes I pull my hair from small things like this.I thought to use Google Phone but that leaves me out from call recording ....Thanks for any reply,Thomas	R

Conference call issue	"First I want to clarify, this is conference calling, not video calling.  
I do conference calling a lot and have a issue every once in awhile.  We have 5 people on and they come and go thru out the day. Every so often when someone comes on, or attempts to come on it locks the system up. I can not bring the new person on, they drop, the other people in the conference are still talking but I can not get back to them, I can not call anyone, and sometimes I can't even hang up the conference that is going.  When I try to make a call, it says call did not go thru.  Only way I've found to fix it is to restart the phone.   
So, does anyone have similar issues with conference calling?  Do you think it's a phone issue or carrier issue?  Does anyone have ideas?  I personally think it's on the carrier side, but don't know.  I would love any feedback.   
I have done the reboot clear cache deal. I am on Verizon. Verizon allows 5 lines on the conference at one time.  TIA"	R

Things on my screen are being selected and I'm not touching it.	I'm having an issue after the last software update where the phone seems to be controlling itself. I cleaned the screen off I made sure there's no cracks or anything in it. It's not all the time but when it does it's really annoying and I can't use my phone, as fast as I hit back it does whatever it wants. It's even figure out how to turn the flashlight on without the notification panel being opened. I've restarted the phone as well no help there. I can just set my phone on a flat surface and after enough time it starts trying to make calls or navigating places I've never been all on its own.	R

When recording long videos in FHD 30fps, screen dims to black with camera logo	Does this mean it stops recording, or that it's trying to save battery power but not showing the screen while still continuing to record?

could the reason why I only get 3 and a half hours to 4 hours usage because I always close my apps?	I just been reading that it might be worse for your battery when in fact I thought it would help it. But how much worse? If I stopped closing them and leave them open would that give me a huge increase? If so, I take back everything I say about all phones having horrible battery life. It is the only thing that could make sense. There's no way that every phone I have used never reached 5 hours of usage. Could me closing apps when I'm finished using them be the reason why?	R

Tons of issues on new Galaxy watch 4 with S22.	I'm having some issues, some more often than others and I need help. First one is I cannot download watch faces from the Galaxy Wearables app, it either doesn't download or just gives me an error. Second one is customizing watch faces on the app is ridiculously slow and is a huge hassle. The newest issue is that galaxy watch 4 manager is constantly crashing for some reason and it keeps popping up on my phone. Bixby also doesn't work, it just pops up and goes away before I can even say anything. I'm not sure what to do, I already reset the watch once, and I had the Galaxy Watch before this one. Should I just uninstall all the galaxy wearables system and put everything brand new? thanks!	R
S22 Ultra suddenly high ping on mobile games	"My S22 Ultra has been fine for weeks until Friday my ping for mobile games has gone up 2-3x for no apparent reason. I'll put my sim card in my Note 20 and ping will be wheres it's supposed to be around 60-70 ping. Put the sim back in my S22 same time and same location and ping is around 200.
-I have first responder plan with unlimited data and no throttling, like i said note 20 connection works as it should 
-Called multiple times no solutions, theyve reset my phone on their end multiple times 
-ive reset network settings, software update, airplane mode, off/on, reset access point names, tried selecting network manually and set it too automatic, made sure no data limits are on in my phone settings, vpn is off
-First responder is on 4g lte only, i did select att manually and i can get 5g but it still isnt as good as it is around 140 ping
Think I've done everything short off a factory reset
Any suggestions? 
Honestly think I'm considering for$20 more to just switch to magenta max with tmobile for 5g access and better coverage..."	R
S22+ notification vibration, I hear it more than I feel it?	"So I did a lot of research before picking up the S22 and I know a lot of reviewers said they changed the vibration motor which made it harder to notice notifications. However what's really weird is I can literally hear the vibration in my pocket well before I feel anything. I guess it's better than missing notifications at all, but a little annoying since often I think it's someone else's phone going off and not mine since I hear vibrating without feeling it. I also noticed when my phone is in my pocket with the screen facing my leg that I can't feel it almost at all.
Has anyone else had this issue, or know of any idea on how to help alleviate it? I refuse to use sound because I'm not a heathen."	R
User experience	Using S22 ultra, 512gb for 15 days. Don't know why, my experience isn't quite satisfactory. There is lagging issues with Facebook and website browsing. Imo, whatsapp, messenger disconnected frequently. Heating issue while gaming. The sound quality isn't so good as expected. Another issue while using with by Bluetooth device galaxy buds 2, the conversation isn't smooth. There is harsh noisy feeling on both ends. But this was never happened while I was using galaxy note 9. I can't take decision just only because of a handsome camera should like continue to use it or not.

S22 ultra still overheating	My ss22 ultra still is overheating, their costumer service is the worst that could be , I wonder if in the future will be buying samsung again even that Samsung note series where my favorite phones for many many years and I love my s22 ultra but this overheating issue is making me very unhappy	R
Alarm clock	Does anybody else have any problem with the preloaded alarm clock? The only way I can get the alarm clock to make noise is if I have the ringer for the phone on. So somebody calls when we're asleep they'll wake us up. Seems to be kind of some kind of software bug.	R
Samsung Calendar	Does anyone know why Samsung calendar isn't in my Galaxy Store?	R
Breakthrough( Software Fix ) !!! S22 series Crackling/distortion Speakers	Hello S22 series owners ,Cutting to the point , we all suffered speaker distortion problem due to getting the device in cold weather or on a flight ! and we all know about fixing it by ejecting the sim tray to equalize that pressure !Well I have Galaxy watch 4 and it has an option after getting into water , to select from drop menu called ejecting water , and it make short tones !And i thought it should be the same with the smartphone , there has to be a way to eject that pressure/mositure , i searched and found an application explained by someone on youtube channel ( Tech 786 ) called Sonic wave - sonic pitch tone sound generator ; you can find it as Apk just google it .Anywya he was showing this app as a solution for ejecting water from a sumberged phone to clear the speakers from the water by playing 165HZ tone for a minute or so .I installed the app , took my s22+ to the freezer for 5 minutes till showed the malfunction of the speaker then started the application and played the 165HZ tone and less than one minute the sound back to normal !(as if you have ejected the sim tray out ).This is a hope that the problem could be solved by a software tweak , that when the phone senses a temperatures drop or too much pressure ,activates something like that or at least Samsung make an option like in Galaxy watch 4 !Finally , i will have the device on a flight in 2 days ,i will test onboard during the flight , and check this app , will it help also without the sim tray trick or no and i will come back to you all.Samsung please fix this !

April Update broke my S Pen connectivity.	Ever since this week's recent upgrade of the OS, I cannot connect my S Pen to my S22 Ultra. I have done a factory reset and been walked through the reset process for the Pen many times. I even purchased a new pen and it also doesn't connect. Yet, the same Pens do work on my S8 tablet so I doubt it's the pens. I think the update knocked out the screen Pen Wacom software?Tech support was not helpful and a colossal waste of time. After over an hour with them I reset the phone with them and then they sent me to a local repair store for diagnostics. They ran diagnostics and said phone looks perfect, no problems found, but they can't get S Pen to connect either. They stated I need a replacement phone? I tried to begin that process and despite Samsung Care coverage I'msupposed to pay 250 deductible for a now 1 month old defective phone?? That's just not right on so many levels. Anyone else lose Pen connectivity with April update?	R
Bug: New Messages app should automatically be added to all focus modes	Just like how Samsung messages can't be unchecked from focus mode apps, neither should Google messages that's now the default on S22.Actually no matter what the default messages app is, it should automatically be included in focus mode.	R
Dual sim not sending picture messages	I am using dual sim, so primary is able to sent and receive picture messages but secondary sim is unable to sent and receive pictures messages. Called several time to Tmobile unable to fix it. The error message say, to open the file go to setting select mobile data to Tmobile instead of Tmobile, but Sim are from same carrier Tmobile, they run all test but no success. Tmobile stated its Samsung error not having both sim able to sent and receive pictures messages at the same time. Only primary is able to sent not the secondary. Please resolve this issue.	R

"Messenger is displaying over other apps" issue	since the March 18th update; it's has been impossible to remove the "Messenger is displaying over other apps" notification from the notification bar.(insight into why this happens is; when a user long presses the notification > opens the 'notification' settings menu > attempts to remove the notification > the chat head disappears; therefore the instance in which the chat head is causing the notification is now gone and you are removing the notification for an instance that is no longer taking place or in other words a "positive feedback loop" {I.e. removing a notification that doesn't exist; once leaving the notification settings screen; and pulling down the notification panel the message "Messenger is displaying over other apps" persists})	R
Samsung S22 Ultra freezes when apps are updating from the Google Play Store	Just recently my phone will freeze for several seconds while an app is updating from the Play Store. So if I'm updating 5 apps, the phone will be fine while the app is downloading. Then it'll freeze as the app is installing. When it's done and the next app is downloading, the phone is fine. Then it freezes again as the next app is installing.Anyone else have this issue? It may have been caused either a recent update as it only started doing this recently, but I'm not sure exactly when.

S22 Ultra won't send or receive MMS on wifi?	So I've had my S22 Ultra since launch and been working great. Now after this most recent update (April 14) now I can't send or receive MMS while on wifi, which was working perfectly prior to the update. Really wish they made it so you could roll back an update. Anyone else having this issue?	R
Screen Issue	Tonight my S22 Ultra grew a vertical green line on the right side of the display. Rebooted, ran the available updates, and then the diagnostics;has not been dropped or wet or mishandled through charging. Sent a report. I noticed some safe mode suggestions, but nervous within the 30 day window. Just wondering if anyone else is experiencing this problem? Only on week 2 of ownership. I expect some first release issues, but it's still annoying. The line does not show up on the screen shot, but for proximity purposes it's touching the left side of the 8 button on the MicrosoftSwift QWERY keyboard.	R
Delay in Gmail notifications when screen is off	I'm using s22 ultra and facing delay in Gmail notification when the screen is off. Already tried factory reset but won't work. Also turnedoff functions like power saving + adaptive battery & disable put unused app to sleep. I also unrestricted battery for Gmail. Unfortunately I still got delays only when the screen is off.

S22 Ultra takes random screenshots	After performing the security patch update on my S22 Ultra for the month of April 2022. My phone takes random screenshots on its own if I open goggle play, google maps or goggle photos and sometimes it will take me to a different screen, the only way it stops is by enabling the adaptive screen refresh rate.

S22 Ultra screen timeout when on a call ceter	I have an S22 Ultra and when I get on a call, whether I'm on my bluetooth, or speaker, or hold the phone to my ear, the screen goes dark and I have to hit the power button to display the screen in order to hang up. I've Google'd this and keep finding settings that my phone doesn't seem to have (proximity setting, for one). Can someone point me in the right direction? I just performed a software update (4/14/22) to make sure I'm on the most current release.	R
Samsun S22 Ultra deletes google contacts	I know other users having the same issue with contacts. I'm not connected with Samsung Account, I only have Google Account. It randomly deletes contacts. The last time it deleted ALL MY Contacts. It's a brand new phone. I have 2 weeks with the phone and I haven't installed my apps yet. I'm trying the phone and I have 30 days to return it.Does anybody have a solution or workaround?Thanks!	R
Battery drain with latest update	I just applied the latest update to my S22 Ultra last night and today with 54m of screen on time, at 8:45am, my phone is at 80% battery life. Tired of Samsung screwing up devices with every update. This is the norm in my experience. Every time they update, performance tanks. This phone was great for 3 weeks until I applied the first update. It's been performing at the level of my several year old Note9 ever since. Why can't they just leave well enough alone. I paid $1300 for this thing (outright, not some deal with a carrier) and it performs on the level of a several year old phone. It's absurd	R

Help with visual voicemail.	"I came to the S22U from the iPhone 13pm and when I first set the phone up, the green visual voicemail (Samsung's native one) worked for about a week or two. Well now when I open it, it just is a blank white screen and the top continuously ""refreshes"". 
The T-Mobile visual voicemail is awful and doesn't work at all. Does anyone have any tips?"	R
Google Pay and Samsung Pay?	"I was using both Google Pay and Samsung Pay on my old Note 10 but can't seem to enable both at the same time since I upgraded to the Ultra. Has anyone else had the same issue or managed to find a way to enable both?
Not sure if it's a bit of a niche use case but I like having G Pay as it always seems to work and is easy to access by simply unlocking my phone. I use Samsung Pay for places where I get cashback with my Curve account or where I can scan a loyalty/rewards card by swiping from the lock screen."	R
Specific Touch Screen Issue w/ S22U	"S22 Ultra red/512gb/SD variant
The problem is intermittent, and comes up most noticeably when using swipe gestures on any swipe enabled keyboard. If I begin on the letter e, s or other letters close by and begin to drag, say if I'm trying to type ""everything,"" it will complete a short word part way through the gesture and then move on to another word all while my finger is pressed down. So for example, with a single gesture the output for me swiping the word ""everything"" is ""egg thing."" It is as though my touch ceases to register at some very small point on the touch screen and then picks up again. Oddly, this does not happen if I start somewhere else and swipe to those letters that I mentioned in the middle of some other word. Here are some other notes:
Problem persists through safe mode.
Through changes to touch screen sensitivity (both broad and specific) as well as accidental touches setting.
The issue persists through wiping of the cache partition, optimizing apps in recovery.
Across multiple keyboards.
With or without the s-pen docked.
With or without screen protectors or case.
Happens about 65-75%+ of the time (rough guess).
Seems to happen much less if I press hard. Similar to the pressure applied when registering fingerprints for the first time.
Seems to have started after the most recent update, but I can't verify that specifically. I've had the phone for a month, and only experienced this in the last 3ish days.
Seems that I'm also experiencing ghost touches, but have only noticed them once or twice.
Any thoughts are appreciated!

Snapchat issues on S22 SD	I'm having issues with Snapchat alot on my S22 (SD). Camera takes a while to turn on when I open Snapchat app and then it lags for a while before the camera gets smooth. For a minute it lags everything you do including clicking pics or capturing video or even if you're just trying to focus on something. But after a minute it starts working fine without any issues. Anyone else facing the same issue?	R
camera	Just wondering has anybody any fix (if you are experiencing the same issue I am) to the spontaneous exiting of the camera app by itself? It just does it randomly for no reason whatsoever and I don't know what to do. I can still get use out of it and it closes randomly but it irks me still.	R

Facebook Messenger Voice Message Bug After Latest Major Update (1.5GB update)	"I have an S22+ and ever since the update I've noticed that the last 8-12 seconds or so of voice messages that are either sent or I receive in the FB Messenger app end abruptly/go to zero. This is true only on my phone so far and only since the update was applied. (I sent a few that I could play back completely without issue today, before I updated around 10 AM). No issues on desktop PC.
Doesn't matter if I use the regular FB Messenger app or the lite version, it's the same problem. I'm wondering if maybe something in the recent update messed with a critical background OS process that handles playback of voice messages in the app?
Is anyone else having this issue? I can't find any feedback anywhere on the web about this yet.  
And yes, I already uninstalled/reinstalled, cleared cache and data, rebooted about 5 times, nothing."	R
Internet connection lost	Does anyone know why my internet connection drops completely like a few times every 5 minutes? It's out for like a few seconds every time. I read maybe it's because it's an old sim card but it works fine in my old s9. Is this another thing like the battery where I have to wait a few months for it to resolve itself. It's really frustrating. I paid 800 for this underwhelming machine.	R
Lag when taking screenshots	"Does anyone else have a problem with lag when it comes to taking screenshots? Whenever I press the buttons or with the one-hand operation swipe shortcut I've enabled, there's always a 0.5-1 second lag from the instant I trigger the screenshot, til the screenshot is actually taken. Every time I try to screenshot a video or something, the end result is never the same frame I wanted to capture. 
Is this normal for Samsung phones? I previously used OnePlus for several years and the screenshots were instantaneous even when my phone was years-old. I was really surprised that such a simple function would have such significant lag."	R
Can't connect with Samsung Smart View/Allshare on my older Samsung TV	After first software update on new phone could not connect for screen mirroring with Allshare using Smart View. Spent hour on chat & call with Samsung. Anybody else out there experiencing this?	R
S22 ultra keyboard and screen laggy ?	Anyone else feel like the S22 Ultra is laggy when typing? Like when I'm typing it feels like the actual input of the letters are milliseconds behind. I switched between Samsung keyboard, Swiftkey, and Gboard and have all the same responses.Also,I feel like I need to double or even triple tap some icons sometimes because it didn't detect my first or second tap and that is with the improved sensitivity toggled on.Hopefully this all gets fixed in the upcoming update. So far I wish I just kept my S21 ultra.	R
S22 Ultra disturbed/delayed notifications	I got my new S22 Ultra phone a month ago. I am having problems with notifications for my apps.To be more specific, some notifications are disturbed. First, I get a fraction of the notification which last less than a second and after 25-40 seconds I get the rest of this notification sound.I went twice to T-Mobile who is my carrier. First, they changed the SIM card but it didn't do anything to it.The second time, the guy checked all my setting which were ok. The only thing which he disabled was a Wi-Fi calling feature which he suspected that sometimes it causes disturbances between network and Wi-Fi. It didn't help at all. I told this guy that I am having this issue indoor and outdoor without being connected to a Wi-Fi.Has anybody had a similar problem?	R

Samsung Notes are not syncing may switch to alternative	It's tough because I like Samsung notes but have to switch to Onenote only because of its sync functionality.

S22 ULTRA Battery Life	Had anyone had bad battery life with their new phone?I'm coming from the S20 Ultra and I could use the phone pretty heavily in performance mode and it would last all day 8-12 at night and usually still have juice for half of the next day.Now I can't leave work at 5 without my phone being at 10% or less and needing to plug it in on the ride home.I would have rather kept my model with memory card and amazing battery	R
3 hours of screen on time on S22 Ultra light use	Hi I bought a S22 Ultra 512GBUsed for a month already and basic use during the day.an hour of youtube drained 21% of battery. And even if my phone is idle and screen off The phone keeps draining very fast.

Keyboard swiping bug	Anyone else that's on April patch having problems with keyboard word swiping? It's driving me crazy. I've read about people having ghost touches but I don't seem to be having it like the ones they're describing. Posted this on a Reddit forum and seems I'm not alone with this problem. Basically I'll be swiping words and halfway through swiping a word, seems like it selects another letter causing it to have me constantly go back and reswipe or type to fix errors. Does it on all the keyboards I've tried. Sometimes typing to fast makes it happen too. Diagnosis on phone says my touchscreen is good. Last night I had a Samsung tech use my phone remotely to apparently fix it but they didn't do anything whatsoever to resolve my problem. All they did was wipe my keyboards which did nothing. Didn't notice this problem till April patch. Anyone else having similar problems? Already tried wiping phone which it's still doing it after and made me pretty mad that I wasted all that time putting everything back on my phone for nothing. Also booting phone in safe mode still causes this to happen. Considering downgrading April patch if nothing can fix it. Never dropped my phone or gotten it wet. I really don't want to go back to my pixel but considering it if I have to wait til another software update since Samsung seems to take their sweet time for unlocked model. Any help or advice is appreciated. Phone is unlocked snapdragon	R
Samsung dex freezing	I just recently upgraded from the note 20 ultra to the s22 ultra 256g. I also have have a Samsung smart TV model un40n5200afxza. I am a truck driver and got these so I could watch Netflix, Amazon prime, crunchyroll, etc at truck stops without using my mobile hot spot data.My note would pair to the tv with wireless dex perfectly and I could watch hours of videos no problems what so ever.Then I got my new s22 ultra. It still connects just fine, but now I only get 10-20 minutes of video watching before the TV screen freezes and after ~15 seconds it terminates the dex link. I have updated the TV, reset the TV, updated my phone, tried multiple apps, and looked into every setting I can find. It does allow me to immediately relaunch dex every time, but usually it will freeze sooner than the last time. I am at my wits end. Is anyone else dealing with this issue or have any ideas to fix it? This is usually my only form of entertainment on the road so I really want this fixed	R

Possible Data Saving Issues?	I just picked up an S22 Ultra after I've waited a month for it and it felt nice to be back with an android phone after a year away on iPhone. That being said there are some apps that I use on iPhone and I would like them to be seamless on Android. One is my daughter's dexcom app.. it's a glucose monitoring app since she is T1D and the other is Instagram. There would be times when her blood sugar would not be up to date and the app was not updating in the background like it should. I never have this problem on iOS and I double checked all the settings for any data saver and unlimited background usage but nonetheless the app would occasionally lag behind when it is supposed to refresh every 5 minutes. Also on the Instagram app if I would force close the app and reset the data and log back in videos with autoplay but after a few times using the app I had to manually load videos instead of them automatically loading. I have unlimited data on my plan but for whatever reason that phone is trying to bully me into using data saving features. I'm on Verizon using an unlocked S22U. Any ideas?	R
Strange Bixby and Camera issues.	"I recently upgraded to the Ultra and I have been having a strange issue with Bixby. The last Samsung phone I had was the S8+ and I never used Bixby. Now that I have returned to the Samsung family, I have been getting used to the new phone. 
Since I haven't been a fan of a digital assistant, I changed the function of the side button to not wake Bixby.  But over the last few days, Bixby seems to turn on at random times.  I have never said ""hey Bixby"" or anything that would cause him to wake up. The last time my phone was locked on my desk at work and it randomly opened up at the bottom of the screen.  I never had this happen with my old Samsung.
The camera issue that I have been experiencing is sometimes, when I'm taking a photo, I tap the screen to set the focus and it flips from the rear camera to the front facing camera.  The first couple of times it happened, I figured that it was how I was holding my phone and a bit of my thumb touched the camera switch button. But the last time, I was holding the phone by the edge and I distinctly tapped the screen to set the focus and that I was looking at my fat face on the screen. 
Now, am I crazy and this is only happening to me?  Or did  I somehow manage to activate some settings that may be causing this."	R
Phone acting weird after update	"My phone is acting like a ghost is using it, or as if someone is remote controlling it randomly.

Any thoughts?"	R

Bad microphone distortion in loud environments?	I've been enjoying my S22U for a few weeks now and took it to a club recently to film the DJ and try the new zoom lenses. When I watched the video back I noticed the audio is heavily distorted and unable to keep up with the loud bassy environment of the club. It sounded really bad. Normally I wouldn't fault the phone too much since it was loud in there but my old S10 used to flawlessly capture videos at the club or at concerts with no distortion. I'm wondering if it is a software issue where the phone can't handle gain.Has anyone noticed any issues with audio capture in loud environments?	R

RAM management is worse than S21U, why?	I love the S22U but wow does RAM management sucks. It struggles to keep some apps and games open and keeps restarting them.

Signal strength fluctuation?	Just wondering if anyone else has seen their cell signal strength change a lot. At home I've seen my signal fluctuate from 1 to 4 bars in the space of a minute or two, without moving the phone or changing its orientation. My old Motorola was pretty consistently on 3 bars unless I went to a different part of the house. I use WiFi calling at home so I haven't had any call quality problems but I was just curious if this behavior is typical.	R
S22 sound quality is poor?	"Upgraded from the S8 and the audio output of the S22U is lacking. Especially  the bass and lower frequency.
Both audio played by the phone speakers and via Bluetooth output sounds weak and tinny. 
Noticed Samsung took away the Tube Amp Pro function in sound settings.

An example - I receive the notification at 7:30 for a message but when I click on it it turns out this was received at 6:30.
Other notifications come in when I start using/when I unlock my phone.
Some apps this is ok but others I'd like to fix so I get the notification right away."	R
Double sim, contacts	I'm using a phisical sim and a e-sim, with Dual sim always on and . So, when one of the lines has no reception, the call enter thru the other. My problem is that when that happens, I see just the phone number of the caller, as if the call were from people who are not saved as contacts. Does anyone know how to fix this annoyance? Thanks.	R
Samsung Music issue	"I put music on my S22 and have made a few playlist using the app. Problem is that 7 out of 10 times when i get in my car and connect the Bluetooth, it starts playing from the same song.. and it's not even the first song on my playlist. At first i thought it was because of a Bixby routine i had set up, that automatically started playing music when i connected to the car Bluetooth, but even after deleting the routine, nothing changed
Does anyone have any suggestions ?"	R
I can't be the only one having wifi issues....		R

Ultra shuts down	"Has any one else experienced the shutdown of a new S22Ultra phone late in the evening and where the phone will not restart even after over 1/2 hour on charge. I have now noticed this 3 times in only the two weeks since purchase. As it is completely u/s when shut down, I cannot see if the battery is totally flat but shouldn't be as it had only relatively light use. It is going back for Samsung for their diagnostics.
Is this what others are identifying as battery draining issues?
Any suggestions, Folks?
Thanks"	R
At which temperature does the battery take damage?	"I was out driving today and the phone was reaching 20%, so I wanted to top it up while driving with Android Auto.
I arrived around 1h30min later and the phone was burning hot. From the graph in Gsam battery monitor I can see that  battery temp started out at 26°C when I plugged it in. It then reduced the charging speed around 25 minutes later, when the temperature had climbed to 43°C. 25 minutes later again it stopped charging at 37% with a temperature of 49-50°C. For the last 35 minutes the battery level remained at 37%, but temperature kept rising and reaching 54°C when I arrived.
The phone felt VERY hot. Do you experience a similar kind of behaviour when running wired AA? I usually use wireless when I don't need to charge while driving.
At what temperature would the battery start to get damaged?"	R
S22U HDR brightness flicker	"Heya, I was testing out HDR videos on youtube on my S22U and I noticed that the brightness would flicker if my brightness was set below 50% before watching the video. Is this happening to anyone else?

Samsung Keyboard Laggy	Just updated my S22 (Snapdragon) to the March update where it unlock the CPU/GPU performance limit etc...I don't use it for gaming at all, don't even have a game app on my phone.

Never experienced this issue prior to the last huge update. Anyone experiencing the same issue you? Also I think I found a quick workaround. Ejecting the SIM and reinserting it, Then power off and turn back on. So far so good... for now	R

Why Videos Taken with Pro Mode look way darker?	I've noticed that videos taken with Pro Mode are way darker than those taken with the regular Video Mode, specially in high contrast scenes.Why is that? Perhaps multiframe HDR isn't enabled in pro mode.If we could at least edit some of the parameters like contrast while shooting HDR10+, we would be able to improve the situation a bit, but that's not possible.This pro mode should also include the ability to apply flat profiles like all modern 3rd party camera apps.	R
Network dropping randomly on phone	This seems to be an ongoing issue with some phones losing connectivity at random times. This is my second phone after returning the 1st phone for the same issue. The April update didn't fix it. Any other fixes I'm not aware of or if Samsung working on an update for this?	R

Edge Lighting Not working S22+	Just activated and switched from a S9+ to a S22+ and my edge lighting will not work. I have read through other posts on how to address but nothing is working. Are there any other ways to get it to work again. My wife has the same phone and it works with no issues.	R
FPS- absolute garbage	"I have to say coming from my Note 9 that the FPS is rubbish. The majority of times it doesn't recognise multiple fingers. I have deleted previous fingerprint recognitions but to no avail.  
When I eventually upgrade this phone I won't buy again if it's the same FPS with no significant improvement.  The older capacitive FPS on the back of my Note 9 was near perfect. I know it's more secure as it's a 3D sensor vs a 2D sensor but at the expense of frustrating operation. It kind of reminds me of the exceptionally secure but very frustrating iris sensor my Note 9 had. 
I'm grateful for smartlock where I don't have to use the FPS at home."	R
Does anyone experience not receiving Whatsapp messages unless you open the apps first? Mine seems to have this problem. 🥹		R
Bluetooth issues?	"Hello 22 ultra users. At the moment I'm having problems connecting my LG PK7 Bluetooth speaker.
It connects, and then decideds to disconnect, looking in the settings it seems to change to audio and calls to audio only then disconnects entirely. Not sure if it's a compatability issue but my other devices (solo Pro headphones) work no problem.
Have downloaded the app attached to the speaker with no joy, it's nothing to do with power saver as I have tried both options. 
Any thoughts?"	R
video compressing when sent to iPhone user	When I send a video to my wife 's iPhone, the video quality diminishes significantly. I know this is common for android &gt; iPhone but I thought the s22 was optimized to circumvent this issue. Is there a setting somewhere I need to adjust? Thanks.	R
Slow charging. :/	"Have you noticed of your S22 Ultra charging slower than the time shown on the lock screen?
I am using a Samsung S20+ in box brick(supports 25 Watt super fast charging) and protect battery is turned on.
To charge from 30 to 85% it showed 25 minutes however took around 50 - 60 minutes to charge to 85%

No actors voices, only background noises when watching a movie on chrome	"When I'm watching a movie through chrome (or any browser except the default Samsung one), I am unable to hear any actors voices, only background music/noises. When I open the same link on my PC it works fine. 
This is quite frustrating, I would just watch it via the Samsung browser but I often want to cast it to my Nvidia Shield as well so chrome is ideal.

Network on the S22 Ultra not working well	"US, T-Mobile unlocked, fully updated to yesterday's update. 
The WiFi and 5G both really seem to have the same problem - constant disconnections from the Internet, slowdowns, freezing, etc. The update didn't help, taking it off WiFi doesn't help. I've even replaced my entire WiFi setup - neither the Xfinity WiFi6 modem, nor my AT&amp;T Fiber modem, nor a brand new Meraki WiFi AP has improved anything.
Is it likely that the phone itself is bad? I hate to deal with Samsung support on it but that seems to be all that is left to try."	R

There is no moisture that I can see and device has never been wet. I have tried using several troubleshooting methods and it still gives the warning. I see this is happening to so many others.

Why won't facebook messenger voice notes play all the way?	I have a new s22. I'm having some problems with facebook messenger. My friends and I often send each other voice notes, and I've never had a problem before, but with this new phone, the voice notes won't play all the way. If a voice note is over 20-25 seconds, it'll skip the last 5-15 seconds of the message to the end of the note. I have restarted the app, restarted my phone, cleared the cache/data, updated the app, uninstalled and reinstalled, with no luck on any of those options. This also happens on my mom's phone, who also got a new s22 at the same time as me.	R
Hasn't been fixed	Have to switch back to s21 ultra. Love the s22 Ultra but signal issues still not fixed. Constant no signal symbol. Missing texts and phone calls.

If not I'll have to wait until hopefully an update fixes it but I fear it's the new modem in the s22 Ultra thats problematic	R

Battery charge settings working incorrectly?	"So my phone's been charging kind of slow as of late. Wasn't sure why, possibly outlet in my Semi. But I decide to mess with settings and found an oddity. If you disable Fast Charge but leave Super Fast Charge on the phone continues to fast charge on my Anker brick that only can do around 20w due to lack of PPS. But if I turn on Fast Charge and turn off Super Fast Charge the phone will only do normal charging. It's very odd behavior. No idea why. I'm likely to buy it a applicable charger soon that supports it's needed protocol, but I thought this was a strange OS related oddity to mention.
To make this easy to understand, this is when Im only doing regular fast charge. 
Fast charge off + Super fast charge on = fast charging
Fast charge on + Super fast charge off = cable charging"	R

idle battery drain.	Have s22+ for almost 2 months now and love everything about it. The battery lasts me enough.

S22 camera's stills inconsistencies? Sd ver.	"https://youtu.be/YJciT6fMsZw
Hi folks, I've been quite disappointed by the cameras of the s22 sd ver. i think they have potential though, i find this video portraying the best example of missbehave on detail and hdr. i got the same issues as this video shows and I was wondering, is this a wide spread problem? for those who had the s22 (not plus) do you have this issue or do you know if there will be some soft. update to help a bit?. idk but i find that flagship experience is not as worth it as it seems compared to other brands, even to the buggy pixel. thanks in advance!"

Problem with base S22 Mobile Hotspot	"Hi,
I have iPhone 13 Mini and base Galaxy S22 (Snapdragon), and I want to connect the iPhone to the S22's mobile hotspot. But the iPhone always disconnects from the hotspot within 5 to 15 seconds when its screen is off (when on, it never disconnects). This is annoying when I'm working (obviously with the iPhone's screen turned off most of the time) outside my home or someplace with no wifi. This way I'd never know if somebody chats me or if the iPhone needs to do something in the background that requires Internet. Since the iPhone has a small battery, I want it to connect to WiFi all the time and not the LTE (the difference between WiFi and LTE is quite noticeable on the Mini).
As of this post's writing, both phones have the latest OS and software updates: iOS 15.4.1 and Android 12 One UI 4.1 with 1 April 2022 security patch level). Also checked that the S22's SIM card has an active mobile data plan.
I have tried these so far and none of them worked.
1. Changing the S22's Hotspot name and password. Password is generated by a password manager, and it's lengthy at 27 chars.
2. At S22's Settings &gt; Connections &gt; Mobile Hotspot and Tethering &gt; Mobile Hotspot
**a.** Turning on/off Auto Hotspot on S22
**b.** Connecting via QR code
3. At S22's Settings &gt; Connections &gt; Mobile Hotspot and Tethering &gt; Mobile Hotspot &gt; Configure
**a.** Trying both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GH bands
**b.** Trying all security options on S22: WPA2-Personal, WPA2/WPA-3 Personal, WPA3-Personal
**c.** Turning on/off Wi-Fi 6 standard (Advanced settings)
**d.** Turning on/off Protected Management Frames (Advanced settings)
**e.** Turning on/off Power saving mode (Advanced settings)
**f.** Trying both MAC address type options (Randomised MAC &amp; Phone MAC)
4. Enabling/Disabling S22's Power Saving Mode
5. Enabling/disabling VPN (the 1.1.1.1 CLoudflare app) on iPhone
6. Resetting all network settings on iPhone
7. Restarting the iPhone
8. Restarting the S22
9. Turning on Nearby Device Scanning on S22 (Connections &gt; more connections settings)
Any more ideas? Is my S22 faulty or is it the iPhone?
Please help.
Thank you."	R
Does anyone have issues with swipe typing with Gboard, Samsung/Swiftkey or any keyboards? Started happening since April 1 update where when swiping, the finger to screen connection comes off randomly resulting in inaccurate results. Tried the below work arounds:	"1. Touch sensitivity turned on/off
2. Tried different screen protectors with same result
It only happens when you use swype typing. I start swyping and halfway through swyping, phone thinks I let go off my finger but I'm still swyping touching the screen. So frustrating, would love to get some more troubleshooting tips please!"	R

S22U friezes for a few seconds in simple situations	Hello!I bought a phone by pre-order, I have been using it for more than a month. I have the maximum version: Galaxy S 22 Ultra, 1 Tb.I installed all the updates that came and check new ones every day. All applications are updated.I didn't transfer data to it, I did a clean installation of the main applications after the purchase.It is impossible to use a smartphone normally. It freezes for a few seconds in simple situations: when scrolling a page in a browser, scrolling a page in any messenger, when changing applications.The service center offered to wait for new firmware updates. I live in Russia. As I understand it, replacement of the smartphone under warranty is currently impossible. Will these serious issues be fixed with the next firmware updates? I would like to know if it makes sense to wait, or do I need to sell a smartphone?	R
Galaxy s22 Ultra April Security Update	Before I got my April security update through T-Mobile I was getting anywhere from 1day 14 hours 1 day 18 hours on a single charge with 8 to 9 hours of screen on time.Now with this new update I'm lucky to get 14 to 18 hours with 4 to 5 hours screen on time.Anyone else having battery issues after the April update ?Have tried clearing the phone cache , did a full factory reset and nothing has helped yet.

Battery life after being at 10%	Hi everyoneI've been using the Galaxy S22 for a bit over a month now, and I recently received the April update which thankfully fixed many bugs, lag, and other such issues but I have encountered a new problem whenever my battery gets to 10% it starts to drop like a rock.I noticed that my phone was at 10% I put my phone down and went to do something else for about 7 minutes before I decided to pick up my phone and go put it on the charger. When I picked the phone back up it was down to 2%. Is anyone else dealing with this?	R

Starred text messages don't save.	When I star a text message, which should keep it from being deleted unless I choose too. I then delete the text chain but on my S22 Ultra it deletes the starred messages as well. Eliminates the ability to save certain messages you want to keep. There is also no longer a trash option to bring back deleted messages. Why did you do this Samsung. This is a down grade on a standard function.	R
Google Play Services and Finder excessive Battery Drain	There are way too many posts here complaining about battery drain without information as to what app or service is causing the battery drain.Over the last week my Google Play Services has gone from consuming 10% of battery (should be 3% or less) to 43% (today over 5 hours).Finder has also been consuming about 10% battery over the last week.This is entirely unacceptable and doesn't even make sense. I have 3 google accounts synchronizing, but on my 2nd and 3rd accounts only have gmail sync and have turned off all others. There are no sync errors. I have cleared cache of play services and cleared the cache partition of the device itself after the march security update. I have removed and signed back into the google accounts on the device. I haven't installed any applications outside of the play store.You need to provide troubleshooting steps on your devices for typical problems. I'm interested to see if most people with device issues, and battery issues all received backordered devices. Did production get rushed because you oversold your pre-orders, and had absolutely zero handle on production so all of these backordered devices are trash? I'm starting to wish I kept my Galaxy note 20 Ultra.For a flagship ULTRA phone this is completely unacceptable behavior. Please advise some troubleshooting steps outside of what I have already tried. A factory reset should not be required to fix a faulty app or service, and I no longer have my old device to use smart switch to transfer everything. I have data saved in apps that cannot be backed up and I cannot lose, so a factory reset is not an option for me.	R
S22 ultra camera issue after last update	Anyone else notice the issues with auto focusing on the 22 ultra since the last update, now it's like the s20 ultra when you try to take a close up pic of a qr code or so.ething within 12 inches	R
Problem with base S22 Mobile Hotspot	Hi,I have iPhone 13 Mini and base Galaxy S22 (Snapdragon), and I want to connect the iPhone to the S22's mobile hotspot. But the iPhone always disconnects from the hotspot within 5 to 15 seconds when its screen is off (when on, it never disconnects). This is annoying when I'm working (obviously with the iPhone's screen turned off most of the time) outside my home or someplace with no wifi. This way I'd never know if somebody chats me or if the iPhone needs to do something in the background that requires Internet. Since the iPhone has a small battery, I want it to connect to WiFi all the time and not the LTE (the difference between WiFi and LTE is quite noticeable on the Mini).As of this post's writing, both phones have the latest OS and software updates: iOS 15.4.1 and Android 12 One UI 4.1 with 1 April 2022 security patch level). Also checked that the S22's SIM card has an active mobile data plan.I have tried these so far and none of them worked.1. Changing the S22's Hotspot name and password. Password is generated by a password manager, and it's lengthy at 27 chars.2. At Settings > Connections > Mobile Hotspot and Tethering > Mobile Hotspota. Turning on/off Auto Hotspot on S22b. Connecting via QR code3. At Settings > Connections > Mobile Hotspot and Tethering > Mobile Hotspot > Configurea. Trying both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GH bandsb. Trying all security options on S22: WPA2-Personal, WPA2/WPA-3 Personal, WPA3-Personalc. Turning on/off Wi-Fi 6 standard (Advanced settings)d. Turning on/off Protected Management Frames (Advanced settings)e. Turning on/off Power saving mode (Advanced settings)f. Trying both MAC address type options (Randomised MAC & Phone MAC)4. Enabling/Disabling S22's Power Saving Mode5. Enabling/disabling VPN (the 1.1.1.1 CLoudflare app) on iPhone6. Resetting all network settings on iPhone7. Restarting the iPhone8. Restarting the S229. Turning on Nearby Device Scanning on S22 (Connections > more connections settings)Any more ideas? Is my S22 faulty or is it the iPhone?Please help.Thank you.	R
Battery life is so bad	How can Samsung release a flagship device S22 Ultra with horrendous battery life? Heck my S21 ultra had better battery life than this **bleep**. As a flagship device I shouldn't have to do any of this but I have disabled 5g, switched to 60hz, and I do not use any social media apps. I am running on the latest April update from Tmobile.	R

Samsung S22 WiFi Calling Issues	Hello everyone!I recently got the regular Samsung S22 about a month ago. So far I love it, except for one thing.I sporadically have issues receiving or making calls, and also receiving or sending texts at my place of work. I understand that since I work in a steel building that my cellular coverage will be disrupted, which is why I was excited for the WiFi calling feature.However, even when I am connected to WiFi calling and have WiFi calling turned on I still miss a ton of calls, texts are slow to send and receive, and making calls takes a long time too if they go through at all. Sometimes texts won't send either.I have tried all of the steps short of factory reset, because I didn't want to go through all of that and it not even help the problem, although that may be my next step if it still is not working properly.I've restarted my phone, performed a Network reset, turned airplane mode on, removed and reinserted my SIM card, toggled WiFi calling on and off, toggled between Cellular preferred to WiFi preferred.I have contacted both Samsung and my carrier and went through all of the steps they both recommended, and they both ended with them telling me to contact the other. The people at Samsung recommended I go to a 'Samsung Walk-in Service Center' which, unfortunately, I don't have one remotely close to me. So they recommend I go to Best Buy and speak to them, which I plan on doing tomorrow. (Fingers crossed)My carrier wanted me to perform a speed test on the WiFi, which I did, and it must have passed because he had no recommendations for that. When I look at the WiFi symbol it shows I have full bars.My old phone was a Motorola Moto Z4, which I NEVER had problems making/received calls or sending/receiving texts at work. Same carrier and everything, and that was only a month ago. Nothing else has changed except the phone.I plan on going to Best Buy tomorrow, but I was just wanting to check in with you guys to see if you had any recommendations/tips/tricks.I'm through Verizon, if that helps.Thank you all in advance!	R
Text messages	Ok so I've had no problems with having a group chat and me being the only android person out of my friends who all have iPhone. Well that all changed today. Ive got the Galaxy S22 Ultra. Now the texts are all coming in separate and not in the normal group chat. I was using the messages to the left and all was good. Just switched back to the one on the right to see if it fixed maybe but no. Sooo now I'm at a loss. Suggestions?	R

S22 ULTRA (SNAPDRAGON) DISPLAY ISSUE		R
Anyone having this issue? Flickering notification bar and random restarts. this happens after latest update.		R
Anyone else have a pink/red tinted display issue?	"I recently purchased the S22 Ultra from [samsung.com](https://samsung.com), picked it up at best buy along with Galaxy Buds2 using the 100 samsung credit. I bought it due to the Note 20 Ultra trade in value of $950, along with an education discount which made it much worth the price. Maybe the second or third day of having the phone, I realized that there was always a pink tint on one part of the screen depending on the angle I viewed it from. Even shifting the display ever so slightly would bring the tint up even more. After doing a search of the issue, I saw some posts saying it was normal, so I just figured that's how all of the phones were. 
Well anyway, I send out my Note 20 Ultra, and stopped focusing on it for the rest of the day. However, in the night time I noticed it even more. It's hard to explain, but looking at the display straight on, there was just an ever so slight pink tint toward the bottom. Whenever I moved the display even a millimeter (which obviously happens a lot as I am only human), the pink would shift toward other parts of the display. I started really wondering if every device was actually like this, so I decided I would run to best buy to look at the models on display. Yeah, turns out that was not normal, as the display models were not even anything like what my device was showing. I know OLED screens aren't perfect, and you are usually going to get a blue color shift when viewed off axis, however, this was just not normal. 
I tried to do an exchange at best buy, until they realized that I had bought the device through samsung, which they then told me that I would have to get a new one through them. So i called samsung, and they basically said I would have to place an identical order as I initially did, and wait for it to ship to me, then return my entire first order before the 15 day window of buying the phone. The staff at best buy told me there was more in stock, however, when I tried placing another order to be picked up at Best Buy, [samsung.com](https://samsung.com) kept telling me there was no place near me that had the items in stock to be picked up. So I had to order to be shipped to my apartment, which is in a gated community so I'm hoping that isn't a mess of trying to get delivered. Samsung told me that they would refund me the money I spend ordering the products again once the new ordered was delivered.
I almost wish I didn't order through samsung to be picked up at best buy. The whole ordeal is a mess, and every rep I talked to from samsung kept telling me different things - One said I needed to return it  to best buy, another told me I needed to ship it back upon receiving the new order. On top of that, the trade in that I already shipped out is tied to the first order, so I'm hoping that I don't get a random bill of $950 since I had placed 2 identical orders. It's just a mess and I wasted my whole day trying to figure it all out. Anyway, I'm just hoping that I am able to get the new order by the delivery date that is estimated (May 3, 1 day before my return period ends for the original purchase), and that the new phone will not have those same issues. If only I had just not sent out my trade in device before all this happened, I could have just returned the phone to best buy and started off fresh with a new order.
Well anyway, just wanted to let you guys know, if you have an issue similar to mine, you should exchange it before the return period ends since it definitely is not normal. It almost makes me wonder if a device like that would cause burn in more quickly as the red color reminds my of burn in. The model I got was 512GB Phantom Black Unlocked. So just beware."	R

[S22 Ultra] Phantom touches?	"Going back a few weeks, I noticed the touch sensitivity of my Ultra (with a Zagg screen protector, film/hybrid) was registering taps even though I didn't exactly tap an icon. A very light touch, or even hovering a finger just over the screen, would register as a tap. But eventually, the official Reddit app would go bonkers. Without my fingers near the screen, I'd be backed out of a post, taken to the app switcher, or sent home. My other apps didn't seem to have this problem. I regularly use Facebook and Twitter and never encountered this.
I uninstalled the Reddit app and switched to Boost, and that seemed to fix things. I also turned off Enhanced Touch Sensitivity, which I toggled on when this screen protector was installed. But just now using my Sonos app, it would back me out of speaker setup or take me to the app switcher.
Anyone encounter something similar? Can't say I had this problem on my S7 or S9. Maybe I need to clean the screen more often, or something got under the screen protector?"	R
Youtube videos are delayed or stop working when I double press to make the video go faster by 10 seconds.

Verizon problem or S22 Ultra problem?	"Have 2 S22 Ultras in the household. Both are having similar problems. (Both with Verizon.)
Today's problem was the phone showed 5G connection with 3 bars. My vehicle showed the phone connected, but no bars. I tried making a call it would immediately disconnect without placing the call. I disconnected it from Bluetooth with the same result. I rebooted my phone and all of a sudden I had 2 text messages (sent hours apart) and a voicemail from a few minutes prior to rebooting. I was also able to make the call I needed to.
Over the past 2 months- the phone will sometimes get text messages on a long delay from when they are sent. Other times, people will call- but get sent straight to voicemail. Signal doesn't seem to be a problem as it constantly shows I have at least 2 bars and also wifi calling.
Any ideas? Ever since 5G has rolled out- Verizon service has been crap IMO.

Camera failed warning message in S22ultra	I am Samsung user for 15years and I love my Samsung phones. Recently I upgraded to Samsung S 22ultra(around 1 month back). Recently during my vacation time in r4 days time I at least received camera failed warning messages 10 times. This is really frustrating. is a manufacturing defect. When I tried calling AT&T they were unable to help me. It’s a new phone but this error is not annoying me.is anyone else also facing similar issue?	R
Messages	Since I upgraded I can no longer see read or delivered messages. And yes with other galaxy users like I was able to before. They can see my status. Also before the profile pics would appear instead of the message icon for locked screen. Is this something changed in the updates?	R

Galaxy S22 plus causing tingling and burning skin	Hi, I have recently bought Samsung Galaxy S22+, when itis kept in my pocket for more than 10-20mins it will burn the skin just beneath the trouser pocket though the phone itself does not get at all hot. Also my left ear outer skin is burnt as i usually use left ear to receive the call...I even change the phone case suspecting if phone case is creating problem and also used without case, but i am still facing the problem....Any one facing this kind of problem ??

May update improvements and Issues	"After 24hrs of using and testing the new update.
1.This update has improved heating just to verify how they have done it i fired up geekbench and my single core performance went from 1230s to 850s range multicore drop by 100-150 points.
2. HDR low brightness issue seems to be fixed but manual brightness adjustment is now locked and control by App in my case that was youtube.
3. HDR brightness flickering in low ambient light is still not fixed.
4. Micro stutters in ui are still there no improvement there.
4. Video playback still drops frames in 120hz mode ( To fix this set the phone to 60hz while watching movies/shows ). This doesn't happen in 60fps videos.
5. Camera shutter lag looks the same no change there
6. Battery life improved little bit ( maybe due to less heat and slight performance downgrade)
Note:- Update was tested using 3 methods.
1. Directly applying the update and using as it is.
2. Wiping cache partition
3. Complete factory reset.
If anybody wants to see ui dropping frames open the notification panel at home screen and drag down all the way(smoother) and open App drawer and repeat the same(stuttery)."	R

Please Help! Multiple button presses and simultaneous button presses not registering in games	"I have looked around for a few days and cannot find the answer to my question anywhere, if someone could help I would be grateful.
I have a Samsung S22 Ultra, this issue occurs when I connect my DS4 via bluetooth pairing or my Razer Kishi via USB C.
When I press two buttons simultaneously or press a button rapidly they aren't registered and the games treat it like I'm not pressing anything. If I hit buttons slower they do register.
I've seen posts with others with S22 Ultras with the same issue so I didn't know any of you would have the solution.
This issue is across multiple games and I've tried my controllers on other devices and they don't have the same issue.
Any help would be appreciated!"	R

Wireless controller eats inputs	"I've had a problem, whenever I connect a wireless controller to my s22, it eats inputs when I press the same button over and over. For example, if I mash the A button, only some of the inputs register and if I mash it as fast as I can, it doesn't register at all making games where I have to press the same button in succession almost unplayable. There also tends to be input lag.
I've tried with to Xbox controllers and an 8bitdo SN30 Pro+ and it happened to all three.
Is there a way to fix this?"	R

Google Messages won't wake the lock screen	"I've checked every setting I can think of, but for whatever reason Google Messages won't wake my lock screen to show me detailed notifications. It will vibrate and/or chime, and I can see the notification if I manually wake the screen. I don't use always on display or bubble notifications, I prefer the detailed option. 
My lock screen notifications are enabled and set to detailed. All notifications for messages are also enabled. It does work if I use bubble notifications, but other apps like Snapchat and Samsung messages wake the display as normal with the full detailed preview, just not Google Messages.
I'm guessing this is just some limitation with the messages app, but thought I'd double check here. Thanks for any advice!"	R

Screen Ghost Inputs, Anyone?	Ever since I updated to the latest One UI for my S22 Ultra, I've been getting ghost inputs on the bottom of my screen. It will enable one-handed mode or hide my keyboard.

Phone restarted for update while using Android Auto turn-by-turn directions	Yesterday, I was driving, using Android Auto on my phone for turn-by-turn directions. Suddenly, my car's display went blank. As I was un-plugging and plugging the cable back in as a troubleshooting measure, I saw something at the bottom of the screen about an Android system update. I had to pull my car into a parking lot for fifteen minutes while my phone decided to update, on its own, without any confirmation from me. This is unacceptable!I Googled how to block automatic updates, and found that the options for doing so are missing from my device. The only choice I have is whether automatic downloads happen via WiFi or not. I want to disable the automatic updates entirely.I realize that at one point earlier when I may have shushed the focus-stealing update prompt, it possible said in one of those little tiny bottom-of-the-screen bubble notifications that it had been scheduled for that date and time. Still unacceptable. First of all, the notification goes by so quickly I don't even have time to read what date and time has been selected for me. Second, I might not know ahead of time that I might be driving or waiting for an important phone call at that arbitrary future date.I'm all for keeping my devices up-to-date. I often proactively check for updates, or accept the prompt when it comes up if nothing more important is going on. Real life got in the way this time, and the phone decided to create a safety issue rather than nag me again at some future point. Adding Android Auto to some list of processes an update is not allowed to interrupt would be a good step, but is ultimately insufficient. I no longer trust my phone to choose for me when an update is installed. We need the ability to disable automatic updates restored to the settings app.	R
No reception	My husband and I purchased new S22 Ultras. They're unusable unless connected to Wi-Fi. I have spoken with several Samsung employees in an attempt to get this fixed. They've been useless. They keep saying I need to call to speak to someone. How am I supposed to call when I never have signal? I have saved all of these chats so that I could prove in court how Samsung has behaved. I have an implanted heart monitor to monitor my heart rhythm. The monitoring company needs to be able to call me in the event I go into a dangerous rhythm. So I can be taken to the emergency room. I have proof of all of this. We've had our phones at our service provider multiple times because we originally thought it was a service problem since these were brand new phones. Our service provider gave us one loaner to use with the sim card that was in my husband's phone. The loaner phone works beautifully. So the problem is the phones. I've been a loyal Samsung user since the Samsung 3. I've had three Samsung watches and i've bought four pairs of Galaxy Buds for me and family members. I'm switching to an iPhone. Which are words I never thought I would utter. If anyone has started a class action lawsuit please let me know. I've also contacted a local consumer reporter about Samsung's terrible service putting my health/life at risk. So if anyone else would like to speak to the reporter please let me know.	R

Anyone else facing the heating issue after the may security update?	I received a May Security update yesterday, and I updated the same however since then I have noticed that the device is heating more than usual.

Significantly weak 5GHz WiFi signal	"Context is, from the router to my bedroom I've always had good 5GHz signal and was able to get higher speeds than my 2.4GHz one on my note9 and note20 ultra, and all other devices. However, after upgrading to the s22 ultra, it's rarely able to get that networks signal, let alone be faster than the 2.4GHz network when connected from that distance. It's only really feasible if I'm in the same room as the router unlike all other devices in my house. I'm unsure if this is a issue specific to me, or if Samsung downgraded the modems
Additionally, 2.4GHz networks are still strong at even longer distances. it's only 5GHz that's botched"	R

S22 Ultra: Motion smoothness drop after using Samsung dex	"So today I was testing Samsung dex on my s22 ultra (US version, unlocked, snapdragon). It was working fine.

Even when I was scrolling through facebook, it didn't seem very smooth. I doubled checked the motion smoothness in the display settings and it was still set to Adaptive.

HUGE BATTERY DRAIN!!??	OK this is just ridiculous, if you want a short version of the story click this link and see the YouTube video 1 minute long about this issuehttps://youtube.com/shorts/KdzKgcScWLk?feature=shareI would ask myself if my s22ultra would even drop to 48hz to save power, because the battery is horrible for a 5,000mah cellI went into dev options and turned on "show refresh rate" and no matter what I did, even look at a photoIt always showed 60hzEven on AOD it was 60hzIt makes me furious that my phone could easily make it through the day if Samsung only made a software updateImagine just how much e-waste a software issue could fix, obviously Samsung doesn't care about your battery because they want you to keep charging it and pay them money 1-2 years later for a new oneHad my s22ultra for 4 days nowGetting sick of a ton of things real quick😡	R
Galaxy S22 keeps dropping wifi	I've seen some articles about the Ultra having some dropped wifi issues but nothing about the standard S22. My wifi is constantly dropping out. The message in settings says it will reconnect when the internet is more stable. So it's still connected to the router (Netgear Wifi 6 Orbit mesh system) but thinks the signal is somehow degraded. No other devices in my house drop the connection, ever. I promise I searched this forum first and got next to nothing for results.	R

Video Buffering Got Worse	"ISP plan is 600mbps.
Ookla Speed Test on 4G LTE resulted in 75mbps
On Wi-Fi with Airplane mode it hit 60mbps.
My router is 10 years old. But computers are all hardwired via Ethernet and hit the paid speed.
Is 60 to 75mbps a culprit of 720p or even 1080p YouTube Vanced or Newpipe constantly stopping playback every 20 seconds to buffer?
I have the latest version of Vanced and know development has stopped.
I am not using a DNS for ad block as I worry it interferes with the speed I get and will cause video buffering.
It just started doing this.
I don't know if I need to get a new router or if there is a phone setting I need to change.
I have WiFi and Mobile Data checked to work side by side if the wifi signal is weak.
The buffering happens even when I have solid full bars on 4G LTE.
5G is not available yet in my area and I disabled all of those bands and only enabled the 3 bands used on Verizon network for 4G but this may have screwed things up? The app I used was Samsung Band Selector.
This did help my battery life.
But maybe it's something else?

is it normal for s22 ultra to gets hot at the top left side of the phone?	"My phone (snapdragon) gets very hot at the area between those 2 lines at the top left side of the frame, in opposite side of volume keys (i guess chipset is there). I have not played games with it yet. But last time i took like 30 photos and the phone became very hot specially in the area i mentioned. Checked in cpu-z and it showed 45.6 °c even tho i was on power saving and fhd resolution and low backlight.
My girlfriend has 12 pro and she was capturing video. And my brother has mi 11. Their phones get warm but not like me.
I planned to keep this phone for atleast 3 years. But will it survive? What kind of cooling system s22 ultra have? Are new phones getting worse? Because my last phone (cheap pocophone) with snapdragon 845 didnt get hot this much."	R
I love my phone so much but this is ridiculous I just finished fully charging around 11 am maybe a little before and im at 65% I promise you as soon as I realized this my mouth dropped. Haven't even used my phone much. Guess my last resort is a full reset of my phone well see if it works 😅😮‍💨		R
Phone randomly changes volume - even locked or not touched?	The volume on my s22 Ultra keeps changing on its own. It's happened both while using built-in speakers and with headphones. It has both gone louder and quieter, sometimes silent.

Galaxy S22 Moisture Detected Warning	"Hi Guys!
I have a little bit of a strange one. A few weeks ago I got the moisture detected warning on my S22. I thought nothing of it and cleaned the port, dried it, and waited for the warning to go away. Once it did I plugged it in and the warning came up again.
Repeat the process and this happened over and over again. However, I've now noticed that when the phone is plugged into a regular capacity charger, it charges just fine. But when I plug it into my 45W Samsung wall charger or my 60W power bank, the warning appears.
Has anyone had this happen before? Is there a fix or do I need to take it to Samsung?
Thanks in advance!"	R
Verizon S22U Problem with 4G/5G signal	" Anyone else having this issue?

Went to the Verizon store and they swapped my sim. Speeds on site were 400+ but the highest I've gotten away from the store since I got the phone is 215 in a very large metro area (downtown LA), everywhere else is 3 being lowest 64 being highest.

Also having problems with ""multitasking"" ex: if i play lol teamfight tactics, and someone sends me a message on snapchat, i change windows, reply, and when i go back to the game, its restarted and im logged out. This also happens with other apps. Feels like the phone is closing the app, and not just hiding it. My s20 didnt do this.
Can anyone help me?

faces and skin looking over-processed	When I take pictures with the main lens faces look kind of over-processed, highlighting details that I don't even see in real life, specially when faces that are further away. Telephoto lens seems to process faces way better. Do you guys have this issue too?	R

Samsung 22 ultra Wifi problems	My husband and I purchased the samsung 22 ultra on 04/18/22, we are both experiencing wifi problems, very concerning. Never had a problem before with our 10 and 10 plus. He drives over the road, so it's very important that he has good wifi connection, but not with this phone, signal keeps dropping, our phone goes to 5g and 4g. These phones cost too much money for this type of problems, please tell me what we can do to fix this.	R

S-Pen disconnected after Galaxy Store Updates	This afternoon, I got a notification that there were about 5 Galaxy Store Updates I needed to download. After completion, I noticed a new notification which said "S-Pen not connected". My first attempt at re-connection failed, but on my 2nd attempt, my phone took a couple of minutes to actually connect back to the S-Pen. Thankfully, it has stayed connected. This episode was odd.	R
Help!	I keep getting this notification from the Samsung cloud. It says, to "check my Microsoft account. We couldn't connect to your Microsoft account. Tap hear to fix."The problem is that I don't have any Microsoft stuff on my phone. I used to but I deleted all the apps.When I hit the fix button it just goes into an endless loop.	R
Speakers mess up and crackle whenever I have had the phone in my pocket	They sound awful! What is wrong with it!? I waited forever for the phone to arrive and a week or so after having it, I can't even put it in my bloody pocket without the speakers almost breaking!Edit: to the person who gave a sarcastic reply: No. I am saying that once I take my phone out of my pocket after x amount of time the speakers sound damaged and crackle like they are about to pop. After googline this issue it seems it is a common problem. Wonderful...	R
S22 Ultra volume maxes itself	I regularly put my phone into do not disturb so I can sleep at night and work during the day, but every single time without fail, when I turn it off the media volume is at max. The other volume controls go back to what they were before I turned dnd on except for the media. Has anyone else had this problem, or is there a setting I'm missing?	R
S22 Performance	Ok so what's the scoop on the s22s cpu and gpu performance. Not only was it coming up shy of the s21 ultras score on geek bench, it's now even further behind after the most recent update. (Via geekbench) I've switched the CPU level from optimized to high and up to maximum...still behind. In fact , the max and high setting actually is worse than the first level CPU setting. And this goes for the gpu performance as well. Now, it's not behind by much. Not at all. But it's the newest CPU and the newest Galaxy.... It shouldn't be behind.	R

Touch problem	The upper left corner, where menu buttons, close buttons, Google home button and many coltrol elements are presented, is not responding to finger or pen touch.Curiously, the nonresponsive area gets bigger at lower resolutions.

Microsoft To-Do and Samsung Reminder One-Way Sync Problem	"I've been using MS To-Do and Samsung Reminder since the ability to sync between the two was introduced.  It has worked fine, across my phone (both apps), Win10 laptop (MS To-Do) and my Galaxy Watch 4 (Samsung Reminder).

S22U AT&amp;T Locked Service Issues?	"Out of curiosity, anyone with an AT&amp;T locked (US) S22U experiencing poor service, like anywhere? I'm not going to blame the current April update since I was experiencing this poor service since I got the phone back in late feb. I've spoken with countless AT&amp;T reps over the phone which lead to the same circled bs troubleshooting of clearing your network and within 24-72hrs things will be optimal which never is. 
I'm not sure if this is just limited to me, other AT&amp;T users or if its something at a wider spectrum since I haven't seen anything mentioned online."	R
just received my s22 ultra yesterday and having issues while texting. I use xfinity as my mobile carrier	Every thing was fine until I did the update and last night I was texting and it kept registering phantom touch and was deleting letters, adding letters, adding spaces and then it would activate the app switcher or go to the home screen. It got to a point where I extra made sure my fingers weren't hovering over the screen at all and made sure my other fingers weren't touching the screen either and it still had the issue. Tried to screen record a couple of times but it ended it as quick as it started. Only happened in the texting app and slide text seemed to make it worse. Anyone else have this issue? I also use the Google messaging app as my default message app.	R
I feel that after the May security patch update, the phone is getting hotter than before, It gets warm even in light usage, which was not so much before the update and maybe the battery is draining a little more quickly, Is this happening to anyone else ?		R
I'm pretty sure there's an app that's draining my battery but I can't figure it out. Additionally, ActionDash is using a ton of background battery as is Google Play Services		R
USB headphone adapter suddenly not working...	Have been using one for months and today suddenly can't hear any sound. It stopped after it worked this morning.

3rd party app mic popping?	Is anyone else having this issue where at the beginning of using the mic on 3rd party applications there's a loud pop and then goes on to work regularly?

Lock Screen Clock Disappears	"I have tried to use them from both the native settings, and from Good Lock. None of them stay. Sometimes it disappears as soon as I exit the lock screen, and sometimes it vanishes after a few minutes.

Apps automatically being added to "never sleeping apps" list	"Running April update on a base S22 snapdragon.  Seems that some apps are randomly getting added to the ""never sleeping apps"" list.
It looks like it might be apps that I had previously set to ""restricted"" and then set back to the default ""optimized"" setting, and apparently, when setting them back to ""optimized,"" they were somehow automatically added to the ""never sleeping apps"" list.
Anybody else seen this?  Normal for Samsung to automatically place apps on the never sleeping list?

Can't use Advanced Messaging anymore	"Hey all! I recently upgraded from a Verizon S10e to an unlocked S22 Ultra. I noticed that while the read receipts for my past messages are still showing up, I can't enable Advanced Messaging. The menu isn't there.
I'm still using the same SIM I used in my S10e, so shouldn't it still work?"	R
Really Surprised There Isn't a Class Action Lawsuit About the Overheating and Battery Life Issues Yet	"It's absolutely ridiculous how much this phone overheats and how quickly it loses battery. I upgraded from an S8 and S10 ( I have a separate work phone) and the battery is so much worse than my S10 and really not THAT much better than my 5 year old S8 without a lot of battery wear cycles, etc.   
Its also a double whammy that because of the overheating, the phone slows down charging, so you can't even recharge the phone quickly when the battery percentage is at like 40% midday. This is just unreasonable for a flagship and Google got sued over a lot less over one of the older Pixel models."	R
S22 ultra apps crashing randomly too frequently	Hello all, I have s22 ultra atnt. It has latest updates available in galaxy store and play store for all apps and system apps as well. I'm also on latest software. As of about 2 or so weeks ago there were couple updates in galaxy store relating to Samsung one UI/launcher and so on which I updated. After that block of updates most if not all of my apps have been crashing. Crashing as in phone keeps going back to my home screen while I'm in the apps or interacting within the other apps. I have to go into my background apps and select the app again to go in or tap on the relevant app from home screen. It doesn't appear to affect the apps functionality but just keeps taking me back to home screen which is getting quite annoying. Here is one example in some details. I have WhatsApp audio call going on, I'm looking at a photo within Whatsapp chat message and photo is clicked on. At this moment, app will keep going to home screen every 2-3 seconds. If I open the app back up again and do same steps, it will keep happening. In most apps, it's way too frequent and we are talking 2-3 seconds and this is making the device unusable because I can only interact with the apps for that duration continuously. It's also happening with Samsung members app. My prediction is some bug in the recent default one UI/launcher updates. Any help is appreciated.	R

Overnight Wireless Charging Issues	I'm not sure if anyone else is having the same issues as I am, but for the last 3 days now, my phone has not charged to 100% overnight. It only reaches to about 75%. I don't have it set to stop at 75%, it just charges really slowly. The phone is not super hot when I wake up.

Time weather widget	"I've used the same widget for a few years. All of a sudden it began showing off the wall days and times for my upcoming alarms. So I tried a few different  weather widgets, same thing.
I contacted the original weather app who informed me it's another app causing the issue. Either a calendar with events. Or my third party alarm app. I uninstalled and reinstalled the calendars I even turned one of them off cuz I don't use it not the problem. I'm not using a third party alarm I'm using the pre-installed one that comes with the phone. Please note that these upcoming alarms are set for weird times and days that don't even exist anywhere in any of my events or calendars they do not actually cause the phone to alarm me as an alarm would and my regular alarms do work but it's just frustrating. I'm at a loss at what else to try. 
I have lost all my previous conversations I guess cuz I wasn't signed in so hopefully this handles that but I need to know what the name of the app was that I can install to help me uninstall pre-installed apps without a computer"	R

I want my screen to wake when I receive a text message like it would with any other texting app, but the google messages will not. This feature works fine with Textra.

Incredibly slow charging	"Yesterday I connected the charger when the phone was 3% and it indicated that the phone is charging
But I noticed 2 minutes later that the battery is at 0% despite showing that it is charging
I checked the cable and waited while the screen was off for 10 minutes and still 0%
I removed the cable to reinsert it but right after I removed the cable the battery died
I waited for about 10 minutes and then powered on the phone and the battery was at 2% and it took like 20 minutes to reach the 10% despite showing the super fast charging 2.0 (60 minutes until full)

And is this a battery defect or it maybe a bug that can be fixed through software update?

The S22 Ultra is inferior to my Note 20 ultra in all categories aside from camera.	"I am not gonna sugar coat this - I am so disappointed and frustrated with Samsung.
**Pros of the S22 Ultra:**
* The camera (I have to give credit where credit is due - the camera is indeed much better than older phones)
**Cons of the S22 Ultra:**
* Noticably weaker and tinnier speakers (tried EQ trick - doesnt help)
* HDR video playback is way darker than older gens (you can check for video proof online - this is the SD version)
* Vibration motor is weak as hell (why would you change the axis) - literally I can barely feel it even in my hand
* It actually opens numerous apps slower than my 2 year old note 20 ultra - this is completely unacceptable.  Try spotify - it is very noticeable. 
This is just a PSA for you note lovers being swayed by the suspicious amounts of biased reviews on this phone."	R
Tips for video recording? Bad quality when zoomed	"Any tips on maximizing the quality of the video recording on the S22 ultra? What aspect ratio is better? 9:16, full, or 1:1?
I tried recording some video sin 4K 60 and when you zoom in the quality is just awful. My note 9 did better at 4K 60 when zooming in, so it feels like I am doing something wrong.
Does 4k60 not provide the same features as 4k30 for example? Kinda seems like 4k30 is a bit better in quality when zooming in.
Edit*. So messing around with it, it seems like the 4k 60 options is the worst.  The zoom is horrible on with that mode and gets very blurry.  4k30 looks much better, then 1080p 60 is ok with slightly more zoom.  Is there a reason 4k 60 is so bad with zooming?  My note 9 does better at that rez.  Software issue?"	R
Random Issues with Apps and Connectivity	"Has anyone else had issues with their S22 Ultra? I've been having connectivity issues where the phone just decides it's not going to connect to WiFi or 5G anymore. Apps freeze randomly. The worst of it being the Google maps app freezing up and not working upon restart of the app. This is an issue when you're driving in an unfamiliar place and it's really inconvenient to have to restart your phone when you may be missing your turn. Is this just me? It's enough to make me consider switching to the Google Pixel.
Side note: I HATE that they got rid of the 1/8"" in headphone jack. I don't have Bluetooth in my car so it's an issue."	R
Why does Snapchat camera and video take better pictures than stock cam?	This just doesn't make sense. If anyone else can test this out. But you can zoom closer with video and picture and it's even more clear on Snapchat than stock. Also Snapchat stabilizes when zoomed in with video like how stock cam does with pictures past 30x.	R
Not turning on at all	"Got the S22U two days ago and has been working fine. Recently however, the phone went into a restarting loop. It kept restarting for about 20 mins. I was busy at this time, so I just left it alone. 
When I needed to use the phone again, it seemed the screen was turned off. I tried to switch it back on, but the  power button did not work. Ever since then - I have been unable to power on the phone. 
Ive tried:
\- Leaving it charging for about an hour or so and then powering it on
\- Holding the power button for 10,15,30,60 and 120 seconds. (each person on the internet seems to say its a different time)
\- Holding the power button and volume down button for similar time periods
\- Holding the power button and volume up button for similar times. 
\- Holding both volume buttons and the power button
\- Removing the SIM card and trying to power it on
\- Using the cable in the box to charge it 
\- Using the cable in the box to connect it to a PC and see if it works/if the PC recognizes it (It doesnt)
\- Inspecting charging hole for any blockage/damage (chargers fit perfectly, no issue there)

Getting really frustrated lol. Flagship phone my ass, this is just dumb.

Volume Issue	The volume on my 22 ultra seems to keep resetting itself. When you switch between apps the volume will randomly reset itself 1 to 4 notches down from max level (i think this is the default volume level). Sometimes it will do it while you are watching a video or listening to music. Is there a fix for this or is it a known issue? I know its software related as there is no indication the volume is being turned down it just does it. Its actually pretty annoying.	R

[s22 Base SD] BIG Change - Horrible Experience to Half Decent | Are defective units really like a lottery this year?	"I had frequent problems with my base s22 snapdragon for months, which included serious overheating, camera shutter lag, slow loading, MAJOR bluetooth connectivity issues (poor, hollow, low volume sound), poor connection to Galaxy Buds, constant hiccups with the fingerprint scanner...above all, horrendous battery life (maybe 3 hours SOT) and idle drain.
I kept visiting the Samsung Service center and each week they told me ""these issues will be fixed in the next patch, etc."" I waited and waited. But finally, after seeing firsthand the USB to Aux cable not working in my car, one employee deemed the unit officially defective. I got a (albeit late) free replacement phone the next week.
This new s22 is also SD and the rep said ""everything is the same--down to the color."" But the serial marker is a little different. It changed from like ""SM901"" to ""SM901 5G""
The performance is now incredibly smooth, runs cooler, WAY less idle drain, and my SOT is already hitting 5 hours (with a few small charges here and there) with 12+ off time and it hasn't finished learning my usage patters.
FWIW neither used smart switch.
Wtf is going on? The phone is actually pretty good now. Did Samsung ship out a bunch of junk/faulty devices at first hoping to meet their deadlines?
Tl;dr replaced my phone and its much snappier"	R
S22 Ultra Google chat features (RCS?) stopped working.	"Hi!  I got my S22 Ultra with the first preorder batch from Samsung, and it's been perfect up until about 1.5 weeks ago.  It has stopped sending texts in the google messages app with the advanced chat features, and only sends texts with SMS.  In settings &gt; Chat features I made sure it is ""enabled"" and even disabled/re-enabled, chat features has continued to show ""connected"".    It's the AT&amp;T version of the phone, and not having a signal issue that I can tell, showing several bars and everything else about the phone is working fine.  I saw a somewhat similar post with a comment requesting device info, so if it helps here it is:  
Phone model #:  SM-S908U  
Software version:  Android 12 One UI 4.1  
Android Security patch level: April 1  
Google Messages, unsure about version.  but it's just ""Messages"" and I double checked to make sure the app is up to date.  
Any ideas why this would be happening, or what I should do next?  I've never had an issue like this!  Feels silly to complain when technically I can still text, but I miss the features.  Even the chat bubble color is different (light with dark text) with just SMS, which is annoying."	R

Meaning no adaptive brightness, extra brightness enabled, max resolution, etc. Basically it's nothing to do with my phone settings. Whenever I open Google maps it's always dim and unusable in daylight. It also is not in dark theme mode for Google maps. Anyone else having this issue with their S22 ULTRA?	R
Notifications on Ultra	Hi everyone. I have a S22 Ultra and im having some trouble with the notifications. When the screen is looked I receive the notifications but when I am using th phone I don't get a notification for most apps, for example Facebook or Instagram or emails. I checked and the push notifications are on for all of these apps. Any ideia?	R
Not receiving group texts from iPhone users	I just upgraded from a Galaxy S7 to the S22= this week. On both phone, I 'm not receiving group text messages from my friend's and family's iPhone users. I've researched, but most info seems to indicate that people who switch from iPhone to Android may have this problem I've never had an iPhone myself. What can be done to fix this? Thank you!	R
Screen On and battery	Toyed with gestures, notifications and pocket mode and the phone still turns on in my pocket and heats up. Its not the button or the knock, could be the light sensor but it works during phone calls. Phone is constantly turning the screen on in my pocket. Turning off notifications seems extreme just to keep the screen off and stop random touches in pocket.	R
Galaxy S22 Ultra Screen glitch when taking video	Is anyone else having issues with their screen while recording? It just started happening to me. When recording a video the screen will start glitching out and have black waves go through it, fix itself and then happen again until I'm finished recording. It doesn't effect the playback of the video but it's quite annoying and troublesome when it's happening for a $1,300 phone.P.S. I actually looked more closely to the video. As stated in other threads it's going from lighter to darker or darker to lighter areas it flickers for like 3 seconds before it can balance itself out. Makes for really really bad videos. Not sure why I notice it more now then I ever had in the past.	R
S22 ultra updat (music skip)	Ok, so after this last update (that I couldn't control bc my phone just DID it) now my music won't play all the way through. The last 10-20 seconds of every song skips and thats highly annoying.	R

Brand new S22 Ultra Camera Flickering	*edit: I returned the phone to AT&T and got a different one. The new phone has the exact same problem, so it's definitely a bug of some kind. Any video recorded on 9x16 60fps has this flicker indoors. I've posted an example of the flicker below. My Note 20 and my brothers normal S22 do not flicker like this using the same settings in the same light condition, so it's definitely not just the lights.https://imgur.com/a/cVjt4KpThe camera on my new S22 ultra flickers really bad when I set the framerate higher than 30fps. It happens with any indoor lighting. I understand cameras and LED lights do not get along well, but my note 20 could capture video just fine 1080p@60fps without any image flickering under the same lighting conditions.The camera is pretty much unusable in its current state. I really hope Samsung engineers have a software update incoming to fix this issue. It's completely unacceptable for a flagship phone to have such a glaring issue at launch. Did Samsung not test the camera indoors?	R
Media files permission	Hi,My problem is with pasting audiobook files from my win PC to my ultra22. I plug the phone, pick transfer files, open the destination (Audiobooks) folder on the phone, try to paste the book and windows says ping!, and only pastes an empty folder. Tried different computer, same thing, BUT when I pasted in the downloads folder - success!, and theeeeen I just moved the book into the Audiobooks folder with no issue.....So, why it wouldn't allow me to paste straight into that folder? What has changed from the previous UI version? Because before the last update, I was able to that....Are there any type of audio files that I can't just copy/paste on my phone?	R
ghost touch	I have the samsung s22 ultra.. is somebody also getting the same problem? after the recent update, my phone is having issue with ghost touch. the back, home, and the other button is getting tapped on its own.

Help with Bluetooth and calls	"Hello all, I am struggling to find an answer to this problem.  I also had it with my s9+.
I have a 2015 Ford Escape I recently acquired.  My problem is I can do everything on Bluetooth/SYNC except when I try to talk to someone on the phone they cannot hear me.  I can hear them, I can send voice messages via many different apps, SYNC can hear me just fine. 
I've read that noise reduction setting is probably the issue, however I cannot find it anywhere on the phone itself.  My S9+ had the same problem.
I called my voice-mail on my phone to see what everyone else is hearing and it's all the background noise and my voice sounds like it's coming from 50 feet in the ground.  Barely hearing any of my voice.
Any suggestions on what I should try.  It's not the mic in the car or the phone because it works for everyone else.  I can hear anyone calling me just fine as well.
Thanks."	R

Swipe/glide typing issues: May update	"I use Gboard with glide typing, which was working fine when I first got the phone. The April update broke it (would end words before my finger was lifted constantly, and there are many reports of other users with the same issue). The may update was supposed to fix it, but after using it for a few days, it's still a problem. It's better than it was on the April update, but not back to normal, and still lifts between words making it difficult to glide type properly.

S22U is annoying me with Wifi connectivity problems..	"First month I had the phone, wifi from home was working fine and speeds were fast. These past 2-3 weeks wifi is super slow. I tried resetting my phone, turning on airplane mode, forgetting the wifi network but would still go back to slow wifi speed.
I dont think its a wifi router problem because every other phone in the house (3 iphones and 1 s20 ultra) still gets max wifi speeds. So this must be the phone.
Its getting really annoying. Is there a fix I can do or is this only foxed through an update?"	R
Microphone cutting out.	"Has anybody experienced with their (S22u (SD)) an issue where the microphone cuts out randomly on calls?

S22 ultra navigation bar ghost touches	Hi all, I finally figured out this issue. Issue has to do with latest one UI update. In the bottom navigation bar on our devices, buttons are randomly selected by the device. For me, home button is being selected the most and then the back button and then the background app button. In some apps this is too frequent and in some apps it's a bit less. It does make the device not usable for most apps. I saw there is another thread for s21 users hitting same issue after one UI update. We need software solution and not a factory reset solution here.	R

Screen saver on s22 ultra resetting back to default colors	I just got my unlocked s22 ultra about three weeks ago, and I keep setting my screen saver (the one that turns on while charging) to photos from a specific album in my camera roll, and it keeps changing back to colors randomly.

The speaker on my phone still works otherwise and the alarm volume is set all the way up. I've tried testing the alarm with sound on and do not disturb off and going into the alarm app to set the alarm sound and in both cases it won't make any sound. Is there something else I should be trying? Do I have a defective device? This phone has been good for me so far but if the alarm doesn't work that's gonna be a deal breaker for me	R

Strongly considering to return my Galaxy S22+	"Hi all,
After many years with Oneplus (3t and then 6) I decided to buy a flagship phone. After some research I decided to buy the Galaxy S22+. (1k+ euros) I must say that I keep questioning myself if it was a good purchase and I am strongly considering returning this phone.
Here are the things that don't work well and the things that I don't like:
NOTE: If there's a solution for any of the items, or if there's something that can be done and I am not aware please let me know.
Don't work:
\- battery drains INSANELY fast. I am almost not making home with the phone alive, I have to stop using the phone so I can have battery until the end of the day. I am not a heavy user, I don't game, etc.. I had a oneplus 6 for 4 years  of use and its battery lasted more than this one!
\- camera photos take LONG time to show in google photos: sometimes it takes seconds, sometimes it takes 10, 20, 30 minutes... How can I take a picture and then I can't check the picture? This is insane! Once I had to restart the phone in order for the photos to appear in the google photos app. I never had this problem before! This one is driving me CRAZY!
\- Google assistant does not make calls: when I got the phone I was able to ask google to make a call... now 90% of time it opens the phone app and stops there, with the correct number in the dial pad, just waiting to touch CALL. Rarely it is able to make the call.
\- youtube shorts is freezing, I am not sure if it is by design, but I do not recall the video having the image frozen for a few seconds, the audio goes on normally, after \~2 seconds the video starts. Is this normal?
Not liking:
\- Google assistant gesture from bottom overlaps whatsapp voice recorder button: I do not use the virtual buttons, I use gestures. All work ok. The google assistant has a gesture from the lower corners, the one in the right overlaps with the voice recorder button on whatsapp. Is there a way to change or disable this google assistant gesture?
\- the Screenshot gesture is horrible, I mean: HORRIBLE. the palm gesture is the worse thing I have ever seen, how samsung could invent it? In oneplus you simple swipe 3 fingers from top to bottom, boom, screenshot taken.
\- switch among ring/vibrate/silence, is there a shortcut for this? I was used to the slider, but this phone does not have it. So how do you switch from ring to vibrate for example? 
\- In picture maps resize button too small: I do not have android auto in my car, therefore I use my phone with a phone support. When you are in google maps and you go to another app, google maps stay ""in picture"" (that tiny screen) showing you the map while you do your stuff in the phone. Once you are done you want the maps to be back to full size, correct? The resize button is TINY, why dont we have anything bigger? Again: oneplus has a big button in the center of the in picture screen, easy to resize. When you are driving this makes a TON of a difference.
\- fingerprint was failing a lot, I deleted the finger and re-registered it, now it is better, will keep an eye on this one.
&amp;#x200B;
There you go, sorry for the long list, but they combined are making a very frustrating experience for me, specially for the price I paid. It is not possible that a 1k+ euros 2022 phone is giving me a worse experience than a 500 euros 2018 phone. 
I always hear iphone users saying that iphone is better than android and I've never agreed with it. Now I understand that when someone compares an iphone they get a ""top"" android phone for comparison. I can EASILY say that this galaxy s22 is not even close to a top iphone. I was expecting to be happy with this purchase, in fact I am frustrated."	R
AOD clock showing after unlocking my phone	Should I be worried? It shows on my screen for a few seconds even after I unlock my phone.	R
How to get audio to play on 5.1 speakers through bluetooth.	Having a difficult time trying to play any audio through bluetooth to an old set of 5.1 speakers. Im only getting front left and right working. Im not sure if its S22 settings, if its the app settings (spotify, youtube, vlc) or the bluetooth receiver. I dont need surround 5.1 sound. I would just like all 5 speakers to work and play the same sound. I know music is typically stereo 2.0 but would like to know if there is a work around to simultaneously play audio on all 5 speakers via bluetooth.	R

And when I delete then and empty the trash they seem to come right back. Whether it be documents, music or pictures or anything, they seem to come right back. Samsung please fix this problem or put the SD card slot back in the phones. This is very disappointing. And I've alway use Samsung phones since I've gotten my first cellphone. Not very happy.	R
My S22 ultra is facing a software issue	Hello everyoneLately, right after Samsung launched the new update, I kind off found issues on some applications, such as gallery, snapchat, clock alarm app, I couldn't record any video at all eaither using my camera or snapchat!, besides, the videos can't be played as well!. On the other hand, I just woke up too late while the alarm was set properly! I asked my self why I overslept too much these days?!Then, I realized that the sound doesn't work at all, and a message just pops up saying " unsupported audio file". Thanks to Samsung US team for their cooperation on solving this issue, I did my best to reset/ restart the phone many and many times, however, it turns out that this is a software issue and can't be solved without an urgent update from Samsung.Honestly, I feel regret that I mad a decision to by such expensive device with that petty issues that take too much time to be admitted by service provider, and after a quick research, I found it commonly happened to many users, exactly the same issue!Do you think we all need to reset our phones to get over it? Even that I'm not a software expert, I can tell, absolutely not!Nawaf Hamad	R
Google assistant activates randomly	S22 on Verizon. I'm sitting here just watching TV, and the google assistant kicks on. Happens randomly throughout the day, maybe as much as 3-4 times per week. No one is saying Ok Google or anything close, and it's happening when it's not even me talking. Anyone else experiencing this?	R
Delay when closing apps makes switching from app to app clunky. Does anyone know how to speed it up or fix it?		R

Nightmode + Ultrawide	"I've become addicted to picture taking with the phone. The array of cameras cover almost every scene I could want to snap a shot of. However, I've noticed that, when using the ultrawide lens, nightmode does a very poor job. Using the other lenses yield much better results.
Has anyone else experienced this?"	R
Washed out colors on S22 Ultra	Got my S22U yesterday, and the colors feel washed out even compared with Note 9. Vivid, bright video, extra brightness toggles didn't help whatsoever and samsung should give an option to boost the color saturation.	R

GPS Accuracy Low When Using Maps After May Update For S22 T-mobile Phone	I live in Utah and got the May Software update like on April 29th on my S22 phone. I was very impressed with how Samsung and the carrier locked phones push out monthly security updates and minor OS upgrades along with those updates almost every quarter of the year, a long with the 4 years of OS upgrades and 5 years of security updates. But I gotta say it's seen plenty of bugs in software updates over the years. I've had five other Samsung Galaxy phones before my current S22, I used an S6, S8+, S10+, Note 10+, S21 Ultra and yeah, I got to give it to Samsung, they are great with delivering a lot of bug fixes in a short wait to get the OTA update.But anyways, since I updated my phone almost 10 days ago, when I'm using Maps I have to recalibrate my GPS accuracy a lot more than I have on any Samsung device I've ever owned, and it also suggests using mobile data along with wifi to boost the GPS accuracy, which doesn't help any. It keeps asking for me to recalibrate the accuracy quite often when actively using Maps. The Location Accuracy is Low a lot and I'm not by any means living in a metropolitan area, but it's big enough that any carrier I've used before like At&t and T-mobile and never ran into any location with low accuracy unless I went up on the mountains or just blacked out spots that still exist or is still common to not have high accuracy with GPS but phones and carriers have came a long ways with service on phones.If anyone has the accuracy issue like this, let me know and if there is any fix before June 2022 monthly update rolls out.	R
Camera Photos Blurry	Why is the camera on the S22 Ultra so bad? It's supposed to have 108mp camera. That's supposed to be good. But every photo I take. Has a blurr to it. I've tried daylight photos in the sun and night photos at night and every type of lighting in between. Plus close up and far away photos as well. In hopes the blurr would go away. I even made sure the lenses were clean. Nothing is bringing my photos to life with clarity. I even made sure that I wasn't zoomed in. I've had 48mp phone cameras produce better photos than this. What is going on? It's been several months now. An update should have already been here. Or did I get a bad camera? I have the 128gb rom 8gb ram model. Does that have anything to do with it?	R

Low Accuracy GPS	Does anyone have a Galaxy S22, S22+, or S22 Ultra and got May, 2022 Software update with T-mobile??I received the the May update a couple days before the 1st of May, and I have an S22 with T-mobile. The GPS on Maps is always notifying me to turn data and wifi on.*It doesn't help!!* I recalibrated my accuracy several times just with using Maps for maybe 15 minutes, then left Maps for 2 hours and still the same accuracy issue. I've not seen this kind of issue with any of the five of the previous Galaxy devices I've had since 2015. And this problem seemed to surface when I got the May Security Software Update. I'd like to know people's thoughts on this that can relate.	R

Sleep Not Recorded 2 Nights	I wear a galaxy 4 watch, plug my S22 Ultra in at night, face the mike towards me, and have successfully recorded sleep every night since getting everything set up a month ago. For the last 2 nights, my sleep did not record. What could be the problem?	R
Phone Controlling Itself	For the last two weeks, I've been dealing with my phone after that new update when anything that I do on the screen, it just does its own thing. No matter what I do it mistyped letters, changes apps on me, messes up conversations, etc.Even if I try to touch the screen, it backs into the sub-screen like I want to select another screen. The problem with that is that I'm nowhere even close to touching it.So Samsung, what can you say about this? Cause I've been through two of these phones in two weeks and still the same thing.Thank you	R
Overheating on the S22 Ultra after the May Update?	I've been having fine temperatures before this update, at around 43-45°C, but now its easily reaching 52°C, not even stressing the device out.. Does this also happen for you guys?	R
MMS/Group text issue	My group text or any MMS would stop working for a good 10 minutes. I'm on the Verizon network and using Google messages as my default messaging app. I've tried switching back to the original messaging app, restarting my phone and even switching between WiFi and data but no dice. Anyone else aware or experiencing this issue? It's very frustrating as my family and I have a group chat and I would get messages delayed or my messages won't send for a while. Hoping someone can help shed some light with this issue. Thank you.	R
Videos don't seem to record	"Hello!
I recently got the S22 Ultra and generally love it so far! 
I do seem to have a persistent issue, though, regarding recording videos. Any time I try to record, it acts like it's recording, but nothing actually saves. I actually first noticed the issue in snapchat. 
I researched online, and everything said the same thing: clear the stock camera apps cache and restart the phone. 
I've done that, and while it is a nice *temporary* fix, it's not a very long-lasting one, seeing as it stops working after only an hour or so again. 
Does anyone have any other suggestions I could do to help resolve the issue? I'd rather not have to return and replace, but I will if I have to.
Thank you in advance!"	R

Game ads causing apps to restart?	"I don't know if this is an isolated issue because I've searched everything I can think of to find a solution but got nowhere. 
I play a lot of idle games that you can watch ads to get more rewards etc, but every time I try to watch an ad it restarts the app. I don't have this issue on my old Hauwei P30 Pro so I know it's not the games. 
Unrelated, but probably related, when scrolling through pages of my home screen it skips back to the first page after the first swipe? Also have an issue of scrolling through the likes of Facebook and clicking on comments - after pressing the back button to go back to news feed it refreshes the whole feed and doesn't go back to where I was just looking. It does the same on shopping apps, Google, and apps like that. Makes it really frustrating to scroll for a while to find something, click it, and it sends you right back to the top again lol.

Battery draining	Hello, I've noticed that battery is falling down really fast, worst is it if you recovery old backup from other Samsung incl apps from that phone (probably every model have different version of app optimalized by model) a bit better is it if you recovery only contacts/sms/call logs, also is it a bit better if you change power from optimalized to high performance (that happened to me in every other model - S7/S9+ that optimalized power is the worst)....but still - have you found any way how to stop this draining even you are doing nothing at phone?

Has anyone else's Super Fast Charging 2.0 stopped working?	"Specifically 2.0 charging. To be fair, I am using an Elecjet charger but it meets all the requirements and it used to charge at 2.0 until recently.

I have the S22+
Edit: just tested with a different cable and it shows 2.0 charging. Will try more tests when I get home."	R
Mobile Networks Menu Under Connections Will Not Load and Keeps Stopping	" I have an S22 Ultra, T-mobile variant.  If I go to Connections:Mobile networks the sub-menus under ""Mobile networks"" do not display.  I either get a white screen followed by the message ""Call settings keeps stopping"", or a white screen followed by a return to the settings menu system above connections (i.e., the root settings menu.)  It appears that a system app called ""Call Settings"" is crashing.
This is relatively recent behavior, I know that last week the menu worked fine.  This may have started after downloading the May 1, 2022 security patch.
Any suggestions short of a factory reset?"	R
No proper "fast charging" with 20W iPad Mini 6 charger on S22	"Just got my phone yesterday, and something I have found is that ""fast charging"" doesn't seem to work properly on the S22 when charging with the original 20W charger that came with my Apple iPad Mini 6.
Surely, it should work, right?
When I said it doesn't work properly, I mean that when I turn on the charger, I see a message saying something along the lines of ""full charge in 55 mins"" when my battery is at 33%. But within a minute, this message disappears. An hour later, I was just at 60% charging speed.
When I turn the power off and on again, I see the ""full charge within 36 mins"" message, but it too disappears within a minute and it took me over an hour to get to 100% from 60%, which is surely wrong. 
What's going on?"	R

Screen dimming using Goggle Maps	Has anyone else noticed that their screen dims while using Google maps on the s22 Ultra?If I turn off adaptive brightness and turn the screen brightness all the way up, within about 15 seconds of opening Google maps the screen dims down yet the slider doesn't move. When I close out Google maps within about 15 seconds the screen brightens back up.It also does it with the Waze app. I thought the phone was defective and ordered a new one and before I would take it I told the technician at the Samsung store to open it and test it for me. The brand new one did the same exact thing as did his s22 Ultra.What's is that if you minimize the screen size of Google maps and run another app, Google maps brightens up again. It seems to only happen while it's in full screen. It's actually very dangerous if you're trying to use navigation.	R
Galaxy S22 Ultra not playing Google TV movies	I am unable to get the Google TV app to play my purchased movies in my S22 Ultra. There is just a spinning circle.

Anyone else have this problem?	R
Gallery App plays muted videos	Hello everyone!So I've had my S22 Ultra Snapdragon variant for about a month now, and so far, it's been excellent. However, just about a few days ago, I noticed something very weird. Whenever I play any of the videos on the phone through the Gallery App, I can't seem to hear any sound on them. I know there's an unmute option on the bottom right corner of the screen but that's where the problem lies. Despite unmuting the video using that speaker icon, there is still no sound.The speakers on the phone are working absolutely fine. If i go into edit mode for the video, the sound works perfectly fine. Similarly, if I send the video to Snapchat/Instagram, the sound is still fine. The issue only exists when I'm just scrolling through my Gallery and use it to play the videos. Any leads here would be extremely appreciated since it's real struggle being unable to listen to what you've recorded.	R

Rhythm game taps not being registered	So, I played Hatsune Miku Colorful Stage on my Galaxy S9 from the day the game released. I was playing fine until 3 months in around December or after it started to drop notes I was pressing. I thought okay, maybe the device is old now. Time to upgrade. So I got the Galaxy S22 and wow amazing even on a new device, my notes keep on dropping. I am aiming for full combo all the time. It doesn't drop as much as it did on the S9 but it's still really annoying.I keep reporting to the devs and they really aren't any help so maybe it's SAMSUNG!! I went into developer mode to show taps and recorded my screen. I watch my gameplay with the taps and there it is.. My tap(s) aren't not being registered. Where I tapped, it doesn't show. Since there is a discord community for this game, I can tell that it doesn't only happen to me. It's happening to a lot of other Samsung devices.Look, I really just want to play my rhythm game in peace without any issues and Samsung, I think at this point, is the issue. It's also happening to other rhythm games, not only colorful stage. Help?EDIT: actually I looked through my discord chat history and found that the problem started from March. Game came out around September.	R

Galaxy S22 Ultra = Lag Fest 2022	What's with the lag? And to start, it's all over the place PARTICULARLY when pulling down the notification tray down just to access notifications or get to my quick settings. It's ridiculous in a phone costing the price of an entry level gaming laptop. Lag between switching apps is apparent. And even stutter within simple things like being in the photos app and selecting something as simple as 1 photo and sending it to a contact. It's just annoying and quite frankly embarrassing, especially when I think I sold my 13 Pro Max to switch back to Android and Galaxy after having not had a Galaxy device since the Note7, which I loved. I put up with Android stutter and lag then because that's just how it was, but wow, it's still here and we're half way to 2023. This has put me at a crossroads as I was considering deeply investing into the Galaxy Ecosystem by buying a watch and a laptop. Given the comments and reviews, it doesn't look like this lag is probably even addressable, because why is it even here to begin with. I'll put up with poor battery life for better overall performance. To answer potential responses, I'm not doing factory resets or wiping partitions or all that extra junk I see recommended all the time. The phone is 3 months old, not 3 years old. It's unacceptable. Don't Samsung corporate people see this? 🙄🙄	R
SORELY disappointed with S22	"I attended my nephew's graduation today at the university of Alabama, and this sorry overheating CPU and battery shut itself down as I wss trying to take photos and pictures. It cost me PRECIOUS moments that I cannot get back. 
I am soooooo severely disappointed in this thing, and ir had soooo much potential too. 
Also the finish is VERY fragile. I'm still waiting for my case to arrive?  So I have utterly babied it. And merely sliding it out of my pocket with nothing but ONE quarter has caused scratches on the back and is rubbing the finish off the camera array. 
Just 2 minutes of video will kick this battery up to 105+ degrees and the phone will shut down. Sooooo highly 😞 disappointed with this. I didn't want to but I think I'll have to to return it and go with either a Pixel 6 or dare I say? Iphone. 
I will not be surprised if these S22 models start blowing up just like the note 7s did. And it does not take much at all to get em hot. At least it doesn't mine .  Ughhh 
Wasted, wasted potential with this phone. I will not use something that could potentially blow up with simple medium duty use."	R

Why is fast charging cutting in and out?	I bought a 45w Samsung brand charger for my S22u, and, when it's plugged in, the phone will charge for a few seconds and then stop, and then start again, and repeat this intermittent charging. This doesn't happen when I'm using my laptop to charge the phone. For two weeks I used a cheap usb - c to 3.5mm adaptor to allow for wired headphones, and I'm wondering if I may have damaged the port by using this cheap adaptor (a lot of force was required to fully insert the adaptor into the usb-c port; significantly more than what's needed for the Samsung cord for the fast charger). Any thoughts or solutions are appreciated. Worst case is get the port replaced, but that will be expensive...	R

Moisture Warning	"So yesterday I got the USB port moisture/dust warning on my S22 Ultra.  It happened when I plugged in the USB cable in my car(I don;t have wireless Android Auto).  It hasn;t gone away in almost 16 hours, even with trying to blow it out with a hairdryer, using a tissue, etc.  Even when the phone is off if I plug it in it gives me the warning. 
Before I do a factory reset to see if that helps is there anything else I can do?  I can't get to the System App or USB settings app in the Setup menu.  I'm not sure if that's a new thing or related to me having a work profile on the phone?  If the latter is the case I can certainly remove it.  
I can't connect a flash drive to the phone since the USB port seems to be disabled so a reset would result in text message and WhatsApp history being lost.  
Any ideas would be appreciated.

Usually a restart is required to get it up and running again. It doesn't matter if I have full bars, it just won't load anything requiring an internet connection (internet, email, RIF, etc). Any ideas? I did a clean install after purchasing and restored things from Samsung and Google cloud services.
Thanks"	R
s22	My s22 regular becomes little slower. Sometimes youtube videos freez and phone camera doest not work proper	R
WhatsApp notification popup not appearing	"Ever since I set up my new S22, the whatsapp popup notifications don't appear. I'm talking about that bubble that expands near the top of the screen, over whatever other app is in the foreground. It disappears after a few seconds, but in my case, it doesn't appear at all. I don't think its an OS issue as my previous A52 5G was on Android 12 and it worked on there.
I'd like to get it back, as I miss notifs when I'm actively using the phone (ie playing a games)."	R
S22 streaming video lag	Bought a s22 5g and I'm getting video lag with my paid streaming services, it's unwatchable. My old phone doesn't have this issue. Has anyone else has this issue and is there a fix for this? On a side note the phone gets quite warm often as well.	R
Missing text messages after data transfer	"I used Smart Switch and transferred everything to include all text messages. The old device shows messages being transferred and the new device shows messages being received. After the transfer, no text messages are present.
I have noticed that the old device.(S21 Ultra) has a blue text message icon with three dots on it. The new device has a blue text message icon with three lines on it. Even when I open the messages app on the new device, it's always prompting what app to use.
Looking to have all my texts from the old phone transferred to the new phone. Samsung hasn't been able to help on this so far and the carrier (AT &amp;T) suggested I use their transfer app.
Well, they didn't give me a sim card so the AT&amp;T transfer app currently won't work on the new phone."	R
Camera issue	For the first few weeks of using my regular S22 I was really amazed by the picture quality. I took some photos of nature, buildings etc. and I was really satisfied with the results. But today I have tried to take photos of people and I'm very dissapointed. The background is sharp with a lot of details but faces are very blurry. It just ruins almost every picture. I also have every face filters disabled. The only thing that helps a little bit ia using the 50mp mode but then one photo takes like 17mb which is a lot and I'm limited to the main lens. I hope samsung can fix it with a software update(it is almost 3 months after release).Do you think it is a post proccesing issue? Is there any way to fix this by changing some settings? What is your experience with those kind of photos?	R
Multiple issues since New update	"Since I installed the new update last week to my S22U I have been having several random issues. The two biggest revolve around Bixby routines not reverting back after the routine was satisfied and the other being I click one app and a completely different one opens, for example I click messages and reddit opens.
Is anyone else having these issues or know how to fix them?"	R
issue with the gesture navigation bar.	I have the S22U and I have the gesture navigation bar with the 3 swipe options on the bottom of the display. With the setup from left to right being multitasking-&gt;home-&gt;back. Now every so often (not super frequently but enough to be obnoxious) when I swipe up on the back bar, it brings up multitasking. Any idea what's going on?	R
wifi signal is horrible.. I have 1.2 gigabit internet and the fastest download speeds I can get aren't even over 40 mb/s. Cable technician said there is nothing wrong on their end. Could I have a bad wifi antenna? it's so bad I don't even use wifi anymore.		R
Warning: Camera Failed.	"So like many others my recently bought s22 stopped working after a week.

Bluetooth keeps disconnecting from galaxy 22 ultra	It takes a few tries to connect my Bluetooth ear piece. Once I make a call, it disconnects before the phone even rings.

S22 Ultra S Pen connection bug	I had an issue where I'd receive a push notification that my S Pen was disconnected. If I choose to connect while the Pen was stowed in the device, it wouldn't connect.I selected "connect" on the push notification while the Pen was out of the device. It instructed me to insert the Pen and then connected to it quickly. This resolved the recurring push notification. Hope this helps y'all!	R

Galaxy s22 Calendar Saving All Day Event - Calendar goes back one day after saving	Hey There. I just upgraded to a Galaxy S22 Ultra and I am using the Samsung Calendar app. I am having an issue saving an All Day Event. Whenever I save an All Day Event, my calendar will go back to viewing the previous day. For instance, if I save a All Day on a Saturday, my calendar immediately shows me the Friday calendar day. However, my event is saved on Saturday. Anyone have an thoughts for a solution to this?	R
Separate app sounds not working??	HiI have a S22 ultra and I am trying to get the sound of my spotify to play through my phone while any notifications ie bixby voice, messages, messenger, whats app come through my bluetooth Galaxy earbuds pro. I have tried to set this up using the' separate app sounds' under the sound settings but the music still comes through the earbuds even though spotify is not listed as an app that I asked to go through the earbuds. Is this a bug or is it not working yet correctly as Im sure it should not have done thatMy ultimate aim is to have a Bixby driving routine so that my aux lead ( which works and connects through a splitter into the charger hole) plays my spotify through my car stereo while all phone calls, messages, whats app, messenger, bixby voice and map directions come through my headset while driving. I have tried different combinations and set ups to get this to work and it doesn't. On further investigation and using this I believe that the separate app sounds is not working as when it is programmed to let certain apps bixby, messages, messenger etc to go through into the earbuds it doesnt and when trying it another way the spotify still plays through the earbuds even though the app settings tell it not to at that time. Anyone else had issues with this or know the set up to get what I want it to do. Is it that for handsfree in a car you should not use the earbuds as these are designed for music and purchase a separate bluetooth headset for one ear which is designed more for hands free in cars. Any help would be appreciatedThanks	R

Edited S22 Ultra Videos lose audio after sharing on Whatsapp	Hello Samsung support:Sharing videos on Whatsapp has no issue as long as they're not edited, trimmed or screen recorder regardless of the app used to do so. Somehow the sound gets removed from the video when sent to Whatsapp members.I noticed the problem in March on my S21 Ultra. I thought my phone was going wacky but after trading in for this s22 ultra I'm finding the issue exists here too. This was never a problem before. Is it a Samsung problem or a WhatsApp problem? Can someone help with a resolution? My iPhone doesn't have this issue. I buy Android because they're open source and won't try to block your screen recording.Please help.	R

S22 ultra touch screen sensitivity wonky	Within the past week I noticed a few hiccups. Started small. I'd be typing on messenger and it closes. Lately it's gotten worse where apps close, open, It hits the same key a bunch of time. Today I've fought with it. It kept closing fb when I was trying to make a post.It's not continuous. Like at this moment I can swipe text and have no issues. 10 minutes ago it closed out of a video 3 times.Am I missing a setting somewhere?	R
POOR Testimonials	Went to Verizon to shop for new phones. It appears as if your battery life is worse, your service is worse, and the speakers are worse. Multiple complaints from long time fans that talk about the above and then go on to discuss your service, and Samsung help, advice/support and how it is useless. Like many other customers they switch to a different make and model.My questions -Are you under new (incompetent)leadership?We cant dispute dozens of complaints. Facts are facts. So, what is the next 18-month plan to improve performance? Recalls? Free upgrades? Nothing? Be honest.Last, what strategy is offered to keep me as a customer? If you have none- I walk.No BS answers.

My Brand New S22 Ultra Died after 2 Months	I pre-ordered and got my phone on February 22nd, 2022. Like many other people, I was also facing problem with dead battery at 5% charge. It happened twice. But rest of the time, it was good and I also had very good battery life, like 7-9 Hours SOT with 24-30 Hours standby time.The day before yesterday, I went to sleep with low battery at around 6-7%. When I woke up my phone was off. I tried to turn on but it flashed the charge empty screen. It never came back. I tried to charge different ways, different cable, charger, wireless charger etc. Nothing helped. I took it to Samsung customer care. They said the phone is dead, motherboard is faulty. So, this needs to be replaced. It is under warranty but dying like this is like in the movie Matrix, Epoch pulled plug and Switch died.Yes, there could be problem with electronic devices, but with S22 Ultra, everything is going wrong.Be sure to click" ✓ Accept as Solution"when you find an answer that works for you and drop some ♡	R

last 5 percent of my battery dies in literally less than 2 minutes	I had the same problem with my s21 ultra, this time I use original charger , bought this a month ago and it had the same issue aswell when last 5 percent hits the power saving mode turns on and it can hardly last for like 2 minutes , is this an issue with all samsung phones ?

issue with indisplay fingerprint scanner	"I just switched  from oneplus 5t to s22 ultra. Ultrasonic fingerprint scanner is s22 ultra is causing me a real headache in identifying  a proper tempered glass that works with the finger print sensor.
Two years old oneplus 8t of my wife unlocks in a flash even with thick tempered glass. Aren't features supposed  to be User friendly ??
I don't want to ruin my 1200$ device without a screen protector .
My mom's cheap 200$ smasung phone (samsung f12) has the finger print scanner in the power button and I really find it convenient .
Why can't s22 have similar  finger print sensor."	R
Camera Viewfinder Issues	"Has anyone else noticed that when you take a night mode shot and immediately view the picture from the camera roll within the camera app it still shows the unprocessed photo. The delay after taking the photo has significantly increased.

Anyone else having their S Pen constantly disconnect using the Samsung notes app? checked the diagnostics thru Samsung Members and it said it's working fine. It does this everytime I use my S Pen. Have had the phone since Feb 23rd, started doing this about a month ago.		R
Anyone feel regrets or considering holding their old phones?	"I don't know, had to sacrifice my S10+ for the Ultra, and now I feel weird. Battery life seems weak, said 4 hours from 85% to 35%, no headphone jack, was this the wrong call? Is it smarter for us, the consumer, to hold our phones for 3+ years?
I feel that the S22 Ultra was not ready for release. It's been 3 months and issues are not fixed. People keep saying Smart Switch causes this but I cleared my cache partition."	R
Camera battery drain	Yall all realise the camera drains soo much battery? 1 minute of it just being on can drain 0.6% of battery, and 8 minutes can take 15%.. How do people even get by a day of going to a scenic place to take photos then?	R
Anyone having problems with the swipe feature on the keyboards? I've used Microsoft and Gboard and this is getting ridiculous.	Maybe I'll put an example paragraph with no fixes to it. The Microsoft one is, so rests so what's all ways all trays, always terrible. But I'm currently using the Gboard one and it gets bad pretty well.	R
Phone doesn't want to take videos	Just like the title says. It will look like ots taking a video but it won't ever start the recording timer. Snapchat also looks like it's taking a video then it's just a picture when you let go. Instagram won't take videos either. My video function just doesn't work. Is there a fix for this?	R

My S22 Ultra just lost a small chunk of glass	A small chunk of the glass broke off (less than 2 millimeters big). Removed the screen protector a few days ago since it was peeling off and got a few scratches on the screen. Was mad about it, but what can be done? Anyways, now, out of nowhere, never placed my phone in my pocket for that reason, a small chunk of the glass just broke off. I felt something on the screen and tried removing it with my fingernail. Saw it wasn't working and upon closer inspection, it was a small hole. This was about 30 minutes ago, it wasn't like that for the whole day and now is. Does anyone know why did this happen? Is Gorilla Glass Victus+ just THAT bad? I'm gonna call Samsung and see if they can do something over their crappy products...	R
Selecting telephoto cameras on auto mode is broken	I'm noticing lately on my Snapdragon S22 Ultra that the phone is choosing not to use the 3x telephoto lens even in bright outdoor daylight until I get up to 8x or so. I realize that phone cameras automatically analyze the available light and choose which lens to use based on what would produce the best image given the lighting conditions, but there are zero reasons not to switch to the 3x lens at 3x zoom when I'm in daylight. Samsung's algorithm for this is broken. Yes, I can switch to Pro mode to manually select the lenses, but the phone should be smart enough in auto mode that I don't have to do that.	R
Google play services update actually WORSE after updating.	"So now Google play services is the TOP battery consumer after the update and my phone stays warm now just sitting there after the update.

S22 plus battery life	I have had the s22 plus for a few weeks now and the first week the battery life was pretty good, I would make it up to 6 hours of screen on time. But the past few days it's been pretty bad. It's currently 6.30 pm, I've been at work so my SoT is only 1 hour 45 minutes but my battery is at 44 percent.. Has anyone else experienced the battery life getting worse?	R
Alarm Volume Not Sounding	As of the last update on 4/29, my S22's alarm no longer sounds, regardless if it is on vibrate or on sound. The setting for vibrate only on the alarms is turned off. I deleted all alarms and still nothing is working.	R
Frosted back glass flaking?	S22U Burgundy. The back seems like it's chipping or flaking in tiny spots all over. It's been in a gas since the moment I took it out of the box. I take it out once a week to wipe it all down with a small cloth. Just kind of concerning this early on with how many little spots there are.I tried to hone in on just one area to highlight them. I tweaked the photo brightness etc a tad to make them more visible and circle. They are more noticeable in person.Anyone else have this?	R
Terrible recording audio quality	I went to a concert and the recording quality was great but the sound was absolute **bleep**. My s10e records better audio. It's just awful. Very muffled and just sounds like **bleep** and that's putting it nicely.. anyone know how to fix it?	R
Notifications sound	Anyone else having this problem? I can't seem to get my notifications to have sound. I have my volume on for all things including device, notifications and all. I get this message below, when I try to select a new notification sound. No sound will come out. I just updated my phone to the newest May security patch update and wonder if that's it.	R
No audio	Updated my phone to May software update. None of my alarms play the audio portion of the alarm. Only the vibration. All my alarm sounds say "unsupported audio file"	R
S22 Ultra Horrible Macro	Did anyone experiencing issues while trying to make macro photos of Flowers etc . Did your photos are blurry , the focus not working ? I had S9 before and the macro shots were much better than the s22 ultra ..... 😞 I'm so disappointed, after looking up the reviews and everything , the camera in real life seems to be really bad ....	R
S22	Not sure what other new S22 users are finding, but I am EXTREMELY disappointed in the battery life of my new S22. I used to be Samsung "loyal", coming from numerous upgrades, most recently an S10. I am "anti-Apple", but, this recent phone upgrade is making me re-think my brand loyalty. My 3 year old S10 had longer battery life and more predictable than this S22. Feature/performance has also been a disappointment, except for camera, you'd think it's the same phone. Not sure what's next, but will look with open mind and not be Samsung loyal.Sad sad experience.Anyone thinking about upgrading,DO YOUR HOMEWORK and be open to change.	R
User Manual	When opening the user manual, why does it say "The user manual is not available in your selected language. I never chose a language.	R

Getting a weird keyboard issue.	When I swipe to text, sometimes it just ends the swipe even though I'm still swiping causing me to not complete words. Anyone else have this issue? It's almost like the phone thinks I'm lifting my finger off the screen mid swipe but I'm not.	R
New update killed my camera	Had notification I had an update yesterday. Installed this morning, now camera doesn't work. I get the camera failed error. Have rebooted 2x. Is there a solution to this, and I don't mean factory reset.	R
Why is RAM management on the S22U so bad?	My S21U was able to hold more apps and games without having to restart but on my S22U it seems it struggles to keep them open without restarting.	R
Snapchat Bad Quality (Posting &amp; Stories viewing)	"I just receieved my S22U Snapdragon a few days ago. 
For me, one of the main reasons for upgrading from S10+ is the new Snapchat optimization on the S22 Series.
However, I did notice that video recording is still as crappy in terms of quality and framerate, as all of the previous generations. And moreover, all the viewed snaps/stories of others' are even worse and in low quality in comparison with my S10+.
i did try to downgrade and match with the same version of the S10+, but still the same issues. 
I am not willing to update my device yet, because majority of people are complaining about the May patch update causing tons of issues to the whole system as well.
Is there anyone who assist me with snapchat's issue because it's simply the only thing I need the most."	R
Charge connected device button won't toggle	"For some reason I can't toggle the charge connected device on my phone about 80% of the time.  It happens when I plug my phone into the powered USB C hub in my car, so my battery quickly runs down with the option enabled.  Does anyone know how to force it to toggle off?

play store not updating apps on s22u?	All it says is it is pending. When I hit cancel it freezes then I get a pop-up saying the play store isn't responding. I tried restarting my phone. Nothing. I have already done a factory reset and was almost not able to even get back into my account. So I don't want to go through that again. If it isn't the horrible battery life or slow loading times now this is happening. I'm almost to the point of just selling it and get something else. I paid $980 for this phone. I know there is gonna be bugs but I've been having problems since day one.	R
Weird issue with cellular data connection type shown in status bar	"I've got an unlocked S22 Plus that I bought direct from Samsung. I use it on US Mobile (on the Verizon network) here in the States.
There's no Verizon 5G where my house is yet (I live in a rural area), but there is in town. I've noticed with this phone that the data connection icon (in the status bar of the phone) does not change from LTE to 5G while I'm in town, unless I turn on my phone's screen. Once the screen lights up, the data connection icon very quickly changes from LTE to 5G.
I only noticed this because I use wireless Android Auto with my phone in my car, and I can see the cellular data connection icon on the screen of my head unit. It now constantly shows the LTE icon, even when I'm in a 5G area, unless I turn on my phone's screen.
Anyone else happen to have this occur on their phone, or know of a way to fix it? It's not causing me any issues (that I'm aware of anyway) but it's slightly irritating to me.
I'm leaning towards this being an issue with this phone (and not US Mobile) since I never saw this happen with either the Pixel 4 XL or the iPhone 13 Pro Max that I was using before I got the S22 Plus (but I could, of course, be wrong with that assumption). 
Thanks!"	R
Good Lock Internal Error	A while back, my phone constantly rebooted itself and I had just got it and I could never figure out what the problem was until it randomly started working again. Turns out it was Good Lock and it was automatically disabled by my S22 Ultra.	R

S view not showing	My s view isn't showing on my s 22 ultra. Just started a few days ago. I noticed it shows up on the opposite side of the screen when I barely lift the cover. Why is this happening. Help!!!!!	R
S22 ultra issues	So first off I've been having issues with the brightness. Super dim is nearly 1/2 as effective now as it was several updates ago or at launch. And another big thing is horrible battery life. At 5% it takes 20 seconds to die and at 15% 5 minutes before its at 5%. Very disappointing when such a beautiful and ridiculously overpriced device doesn't match performance to price especially from a multi-billion dollar company.	R
Bad battery life, poor performance	I have had my s22 ultra for weeks now, and I still haven't seen a full days' worth of battery, adaptive battery is turned on, as well as optimized processing speed. It bothers me that my wife's iPhone 13 pro max gets at least one and a half days worth of battery life, and she uses her cell phone way more than me. Why should I have to go into settings and tweak performance and/or battery settings to get a little bit more juice? Why can't it be optimized out of the box??? Another thing, performance is underwhelming, many times during the day I unlock my phone for use and notification icons and notifications, take a bit to load, I have tried high processing speed and this problem still persists, some apps open slow as well. Why can't my phone be as good as my wife's? 😪	R
S22ULTRA	I have never had a phone with so many problems and virus camera system battery no no not a real problem with the signal and it becomes very slow and I have to turn it off every real time Frustrating	R

S22 Ultra Still Having Connectivity Issues	My S22Ultra even after the update this morning still gives me the "no signal" icon a LOT. The only way I've found to remedy this is to force the phone to 4G LTE. It is so crazy to me that Samsung cannot remedy this. The phone should seamlessly switch between 5G and 4G without going to "No Signal" for minutes at a time, dropping calls, losing internet etc. Am I alone in this or are others still experiencing it?	R
Latest update f#@ked my camera 5/11	Camera failed to openerror after latest security update.I'm beyond aggravated that an official update from Samsung can ruin a perfectly functional phone and they don't have any solution other than a few rudimentary fix attempts before suggesting a factory reset. Yes, Samsung support, I've tried EVERYTHING YOU HAVE SUGGESTED TO OTHERS WITH THE EXACT SAME ISSUE, DOESN'T WORK. I do not want to factory reset this phone.	R
Color saturation 22 Ultra	I find the color saturation washed out on the ultra s22 . I look back all the way to my note 5 and all look better than this . Even on vivid its way to pale the colors .

Galaxy S22+ problems	I can't record videos with the camera as well as in snapchatAlso there is a problem with the sound of videos, ringtones & the alarm !!I regret buying this phone 😤👎	R
Apps self launching	Just got my S22 Ultra yesterday and I'm already having a really annoying issue. This phone keeps launching apps without me touching the screen. I navigate around the home pages and all of a sudden, Chrome or messages will open without me having ever touched those apps. Then when I fully open the quick panel, it swipes all the way to the other end of the panel when I never swiped that way. What the heck, this is annoying.	R
S22 battery life	I'm confused as I see many people saying that they only 3 or 4 hours of screen on time as I just bought the base S22 and right now I'm at 67% with 2hours and 39 minutes of SOT. Which isn't very bad. The first day I got 6.5 hours of sot with 23% back. Also it hasn't gotten hot at all. My only concern is that some youtube videos in the beginning will be blurry for a minute before it fixes itself. I did notice that my s21 also does that sometimes too. Considering sending the s22 back for a replacement but I'm terrified I may end up getting a dud in the battery department as from reading reviews people either get one with great battery life or completely terrible battery life.	R
S22 battery drain and overheating directly out of the box	I've read a couple of reviews, stating that the battery on the S22 needs to "adapt" or whatever, but within minutes of even turning on the phone the battery started to overheat. And it's been on 6 hours now and I have hardly touched it and it went from a full charge to 40%. I can see that if you're on something or doing something, but I have only just barely jumped on it.It shouldn't be like this. And we shouldn't have to wait a few days to a week for the battery to "adapt" if it can't even adapt to nothing being used at all. Plus the phone is warm to the touch and I again, I've hardly used it. I never had to do that with any of my past Samsungs. Not even the nonflagship models do that.This is ridiculous	R
No 5G symbol with new S22U?	Setting up my new unlocked S22U, and I've noticed that the 3G/4G/5G does not appear with the mobile data strength symbol in the notifications at the top of the screen. I swapped the sim in from my Note 20U 5G, and am on Verizon. The 4G/5G symbol did show up on that phone. Text, calls and data are working fine. I looked through the pinned thread about home screens and saw a few in there that were not displaying it either. Is this an S22U thing? Or is it because I'm unlocked? Anyway to get it working? I'm often times way out in the boonies, and knowing what kind of signal I have is important to me.	R

On my S22 Ultra, the round-styled check boxes in Samsung apps just turn invisible when I check them	"In Samsung apps that use their custom round checkboxes, checking them just makes them turn invisible on my S22U.
[Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/TBnpdRz.jpg) (I've checked the ""Get notifications ..."" Item)
It does this everywhere they use this type of checkbox, not just Health (I normally see them used during guided setup when opening the apps for the first time). It doesn't do this on my wife's S22U though, or when using Samsung apps on my old OnePlus phone - the checkboxes fill in correctly with a solid color. I know it wasn't like this on my S22U when I got it though, so I must have done something at some point to break it.
I've tried re-applying the default theme (I never changed it in the first place but figured I'd try just in case) but it didn't help. I've also tried all three resolution settings, changing to light mode, and restarting the phone.
I'm not going to factory reset over invisible checkboxes, but at this point it seems like that'd be the only option if I want to see what I've already checked (or potentially what was checked by default, obscuring that I can even disable it).
Has anyone else seen this or know of a way to fix it?"	R
The Snapchat video 📷 is so shit.	"The Snapchat video 📷  is so shit. Can I do anything about that? Do you believe that Samsung will do something? it's lagging, and it freezes sometimes 😒 is it only me ? It's annoying 😔

Audio ....so low (S22 Ultra)	"Has anyone noticed that their default audio (regardless) of volume setting....is WAY, WAY low?
Yes I've had my hearing checked?
I've compared my phone to wife's iPhone, and others android phones. 
Almost seems I have to use one of those audio boosting apps (not a fan of that) to be able to hear things like YouTube or something with audio.
If affects not sure YouTube, but most any audio...
Oddly enough...even notifications and ringtones.
I've checked all audio settings I can get my hands on.

Music Playing At Same Time	Hi I just recently noticed that if I am listening to music on SoundCloud and decide to switch over to Spotify that the music continues to play from SoundCloud over Spotify rather than switching over. It does the same if I start with Spotify then hit 'play' on a SoundCloud song. Furthermore, if I am listening to music on my headphones and someone calls me, the music continues to play while I'm on a call. This just started happening after I paired up my new Beats Solo3 headphone to my phone this week. Before this everything seemed to work fine and music from one app or the other would stop when I would switch to answer a call or move to another app. I've been trying to troubleshoot and I can't find a way to fix this. Has anyone had a similar experience or any luck with getting this resolved?	R

S22 Ultra Vibration Sounds Tinny	Recently my S22 Ultra's vibration started sounding really bad, like something was loose inside and was rattling around.

Group SMS not working properly	My wife and i upgraded to the S22 and the S22 Ultra. we have been life long Samsung mobile users and this is the first time either of has had issues with text messaging. specifically group text messages. whenever we send a group message we see the message with the sending and three dots. the dots keep moving and it takes a long time to actually send 30 seconds to a minute. whenever we receive a group message we see it come is an individual message from whoever sent it to the group and then a bunch of blue dots spin and spin until we finally receive the message, this will take at least 1 minute, sometimes several minutes.this is so frustrating. we have rebooted our phones, we have checked all the settings, can't seem to find the culprit. i should note this issue didnt' start happening until 2 months after we had the phones. anyone else notice this issue or have any idea how to resolve it?

S22 ultra camera failed	Phone is less than a week old and since day one I've had trouble with the camera. It will load and then start jittering and force close with a camera failed message. I would say the camera does this 60% of the time but have since relised the video recording does it 90 % of the time. Did all of tech supports recommended problem solving that amounts to turning it off and back on to no avail. $1200 phone that all Samsung talked about was this fantastic camera and it's basically useless on my phone. Don't get me started on the battery either	R

Random screen touches. Glitching input at times.	I have the S22 Ultra... I have random touches on my screen mostly at specific times or in specific apps (including native Samsung apps).I turned on Developer Options>Input>Pointer Location and it does show the screen being touched at the times of glitching, in those areas which mostly center towards the bottom of the screen.I really hope this is not a hardware issue... The only reason I'm believing it is software-related is because it only happens in specifics applications, and it started happening after a recent firmware update.	R
Issues with phone dialer while watching videos	I can be watching Netflix, Sling, any video app and watching sideways, randomly, the video minimizes and the phone dialer opens up.

Keyboard delay on s22 ultra	I'm getting so fed up I'm about ready to move on from the s22 ultra. Stupid issue where when my keyboard comes up, often I can't type for a second or 2. It won't read my touches right away! It makes the phone feel laggy when it's otherwise smooth. It's overall making this the worst phone amongst the 4 Samsung phones I've had in a row including the s9+, note 10+, and s21 ultra. None of them did that!I completely removed good lock. Seemed to help. Then it came back. Switched to Samsung keyboard. Not only is it a laggy mess compared to Gboard, but it also had exact same issue so it's a system issue not a particular keyboard issue. Finally went through killed like 30 bloatware apps installed by at&t and phone overall seemed to be running better for over 48 hours then... It came back! I'm at my witts end with it!How can it go away and come back like that?I hope someone has some info I'm pulling the little hair I have left out!	R

I also have an issue where when I'm watching full screen videos in a browser like Chrome, if I try to use the navigation bar on the video, it just skips back to the beginning. Any further taps on the bar just put the video at 0:00 and I have to refresh the page to fix.

Strange volume pop-up behavior after May update	"I installed the May update a couple of days ago (Unlocked S22 Ultra on AT&amp;T), and I've noticed some weird behavior from the small volume panel that pops out of the side of the screen when you turn media volume up or down. 
I tend to keep my media volume at 0 until I start watching or listening to something. Then I'll hold the volume up button until I get to my desired level. It worked perfectly until the May update. 
Now, when I hold down the volume up or down button, nothing happens. I have to turn the volume up or down one click at a time. The little panel doesn't even pop out unless I short click the volume up or down buttons once. 
Is anyone else experiencing this? I've checked through every app (Good Lock and it's corresponding modules, such as Sound Assistant), and I don't see any setting that would control this action. 
I'm wanting to see if anyone else has noticed this so I can figure out if it's a bug that was introduced with the most recent update."	R
galaxy s22 running hot when charging and in pocket	Hi my 4 day old galaxy s22 is running hot when charging. It also gets hot in my pocket with the spigen clear gel case and a cheap case from ebay. Its not burning hot but its annoying in my pocket. Its not always hot in my pocket tho. I find the spigen case a bit thick but its gripier than my case from ebay. Should I be worried about explosion? Still trying to find a thin and grippy case. Even with the slimmer case it gets hot when charging but not as much. Not sure if I want to return this phone. The phone is still doing machine learning for the battery around 65%. I also use a 15 w samsung charger as i dont want my battery to degrade faster by using the 25w charger. Also my charger is fine and the cable is a new samsung cable. Does your galaxy s22 get hot?	R

Removing all Metadata, uploading from different service, etc. It HAS to be a samsung glitch and I will get rid of this phone if it's not fixed.If anyone could help I'd appreciate it.Thanks, Dominic	R
Be wary of attempting to return your device to Verizon	"So today my phone got EXTREMELY  hot(see pic) and it regularly gets up to 98-99 just doing mundane tasks such as browsing the net and posting here, and other light activity. 
It was a pretty day so I got outside(81 degree air temp, 88% humidity) took some photos, and as you can see, the phone got MAJORLY hot.  
At that point since I still have 3 more weeks or so to make an exchange for another device of the same model via store warranty , I decided to go to the point of purchase at my local Verizon store and tried to swap it. 
Instead they shot me the line of ""well you have a third party battery app installed,its going to tell you thst to scare you, therefore we will not exchange your device"". Even though there is VERY clearly the same exact temperature warnining from the system itself, which absolurely should have validated an exchange. 
Bur I digress, they refused, so now I have to use my device in power save mode at all times and not watch much video or do camera recordings. The rep installed a benchmark test and claimed because my phone passed it, there is no grounds to exchange. 
So I am now stuck with a bomb of a phone that is probably going to either blow up or its going to severely degrade my battery because of heating up during simple tasks.  Lovely :/. I guess I'll use it till it inevitably blows on me I suppose.

New, even more annoying bug	"So I posted a while ago when I first received my Pre-Ordered S22 Ultra. Had a few bugs, and thankfully all of them have seemed to be fixed with updates. That is, until the latest update (I assume) seems to have broken the most important part of the phone for me. The camera. The exact reason I upgraded from my S20 Ultra.
Now? It won't take video. Snapchat won't record video (it stops and takes a picture) and the camera app itself won't record (press record, counter shows 0:00 and doesn't save footage). The fix? Restarting it. Then it comes back again, restart it. So on and so on. I'm not a huge fan of having to reboot my device 3+ times a day when the camera decides to act up, making me miss important footage for work.
I've tried:
Clearing cache data on boot menu
Repairing apps on boot menu
Clearing cache on camera app
updating all apps to most recent versions"	R
very different battery drain amount across devices	"Since did not like the green color much on the base s22, I decided to buy a black s22.  When I was setting up the black s22, something was different about it.  It was running hot and the battery was draining like crazy similar to early reviews and some people complained in this subreddit.  
I then used the accubattery to monitor the amount of drain.  Since I had two other s22 for my family, I could compare 4 s22 side by side (one of them was s22+).  To control, I used SmartSwitch to transfer data from my old s10e so that all 4 s22 could have the same setup with a bit of junk from my old phone running in the background.
My initial impression remained the same.  This black s22 was going crazy draining 1500 to even 1700mA when I simply try to login apps like Best Buy and Amazon and such.  The same activity did not trigger that much drain on the other three phones generally hovering 700-900mA at most.  The same activity on s10e did not even go above 700mA and that phone remained cool to touch.  
As you guys probably know, there's this thing called chip binning.  And for Snapdragon 8 gen 1, the tolerance level seems pretty wild.  This means that you can actually get a really crappy phone for the same price.  The black s22 did not show any visible signs of ""defect"" other than it constantly goes hot even for simple web browsing / login activity and then cools down soon after I stopped using it."	R

Game sound quality issues	"Hi,

Can the low-light video quality on the S22 Ultra be improved through software update or would it require a hardware upgrade (ie waiting for the next model)?	"So I think the video quality on the S22 Ultra is really great during daytime or under bright light. But in low-light, the video quality is quite underwhelming imo.
Do you guys think the existing lenses on the S22 Ultra can be utilized to improve the video quality under low-light and rolled out as a software update?

Kindle App Permissions Issue	"Hello folks, I'm having trouble getting the Kindle app to detect my books stored on the device, under a Books directory.  
The Kindle app has a ""Local File Access"" setting and I see my directories in there. But everytime I try to enable my directory, the app just crashes with a ""provide permission to the Books directory"".  I checked my app permissions and I do have ""Media File"" access for it (but not full File access if that makes a difference).  
So the thing is, I did the debloat using the package list on [xda](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/debloat-lists-s22-ultra-series.4413149/) and I might have uninstalled something important that Kindle needed but I can't figure out what.  
From the debloat list, the only one that seemed to relate to file access is ""com.google.android.documentsui"" so I reinstalled, but no dice yet.   
Thoughts?  Thanks"	R

Worst experience with samsung S22	I really don't have any idea what's wrong with this phone. The day I bought this phone, I'm using it with its back cover. I use my phone with extra care, so used to clean it in regular intervals. Now what I see it is getting scratches or the color is getting off. This is the first time I'm experiencing somethinglike this. I have used so many phones inthe past but never faced thisissue even with any cheap phone as well. I paid so much for this phone, because I wanted a powerful compact phone, but with time my experience is getting worst.I'm an occasional gamer, so I faced heavy throttle, heating, performance issue & fast battery drain but never bothered about it because I'm a occasional gamer. But some kind of physical damage without any rough wear & tear really forced me to write thisemail & think about the reason behindthis.It's really heart breaking when you buy a new phone & see physical damages on it without any reason. But you guys will never understand this. I ponder either this unit I received is having some issue with its build or the entire s22 line up is defective.There so many issues pre existing in this phone starting from heating, throttle, worst battery backup, takes too long to reboot, vibration doesn't work, speaker not loud at all, audio drop in bluetooth earphones. Now physical damage without any reason cannot be tolerated.I don't want you guys to fix these issues which I mentioned. You guys just let me know the reason why my phone getting physical damage with back cover on it. It is really disgusting using this phone.I do a have proposition, either you recall this unit as u did for note 7 & give a refund or else replace this unit atleast. I bought this phone in the month of March, 2022. Now I'm regretting buying this phone.If you guys are not able to do so, I would consider this as a bad dream & would decide to stay away from samsung products. Please don't release a product in a hurry that customers have to suffer to such an extent where a person like me who write generally writes a mail within 2 lines have to write a essay because of ultimate frustration.I know you guys would never believe me without any proof, but here there is no option for attachment. I want to attach the snaps of my new phone turning old day by day as the color is peeling of, which is shocking for me as well. Hope some kind of response & resolution ASAP.	R

Issues after update.	After I had done the update on May 13, I started to notice an issue with the camera and videos on my gallery. I would try to take a video but the time on top of the video won't proceed but it shows me that the camera and mic is on. I would press stop but no video was made. I would try it again and no video was made. So I would go to my gallery and play a video but it would not play, and no sound would come out, I press play but the video won't start. I would have to reset my phone a couple times during the day to get it going. Anyone else has this issue?Edit: I have an S22 Ultra.	R
Phone keeps restarting when battery low	As the title states, my S22 randomly restarts itself. 99% of the time it is when the battery is below 15%. I want to know if others are getting the same issue or if I got a defective phone.	R

S22 ultra keyboard	I have so many problems with my s22 ultra 😫. Can someone help me with finding a good keyboard layout? The default keyboard space bar has me typing. Instead of a space. I really don't enjoy the s22 phone helping to find some good support to make it more enjoyable.	R

Android auto not working with Pioneer car stereo.	Black screen on my Pioneer audio system. Android Audio stops, says complete the setup, black screen, Google Maps does not work. My stereo worked fine with my S10. Samsung has know about this for at least 3 months. Where is the fix?	R
My S22 Ultra Ghostly Touch Screen Activity	*****Update:As a few other members in the comments belowed have mentioned, there was a recent update. This appears to have fixed the problems I've noted below. I'm leaving this post here for future reference in case others experience the same issues. But the problem seems to have been resolved!*****TLDR; My S22 Ultra seems to have a ghost.. it will press one of the 3 menu buttons at the bottom of my screen when I'm using certain apps, most commonly the Back button (bottom right), but sometimes the Home (middle) button, and rarely the Recent Activity (bottom left) button. I can literally put my phone down, and it'll still touch the bottom of the screen on its own.It only seems to do this with specific apps, and only when using those specific apps... these include Samsung Notes, Tradingview and Flipboard.The fact that these apps have no correlation with eachother suggests that it's either being caused by my screen protector, or there's a glitch in the software whenever a certain type of app is opened.I've never dropped the phone, software and apps are all up to date, and it's never encountered water or even humidity.I believe I can rule-out my screen protector because it doesn't have this problem with any other app on my phone. It's only with very specific apps. I've reached out to the developers of those apps, but they haven't responded yet. I'm using the ArmorSuit Screen protector. I used the clear screen protector at first, but when the problems started to occur, I thoughts I'd switch, thinking that was the cause of the issue. But after applying a new screen protector (same brand), it's still an issue.The apps and android software is completely up-to-date, and I can post versions if needed, I just don't know which would be relevant in this case.I'll note that I also have Developer Mode activated, so I can edit a bunch of settings that aren't normally accessible to the standard owner. However, I haven't adjusted any of the settings, yet. I'm testing the sensors and sensor Activity to see if this is causing it, but it still seems to be an issue.Any other thoughts or ideas on what else I could be checking or adjusting? Thanks	R

I tried airplane mode. I unpaired my samsung watch and just used 1 bluetooth device at a time, did not solve the issue. Yesterday I even RESET my phone to factory condition :/...did not solve the issue. Please help.	R

Galaxy S22 ULTRA PROBLEMS !!!	I have Samsung cellphones for what...20 years? Every cell has a problem here and there...My S8+ the screen got all read after 2 years, the S22 Ultra had a poor camera, could never focus near on macro and this S22 ULTRA is by far the worst cell I have had. Seems like today they only think in fine tune the camera and forget what the cellphone is about - MAKE RELIABLE PHONE CALLS!!!I have the S22 Ultra with Snapdragon in U.S., recently went to Brazil for 4 weeks and even that I had a International access via Verizon, my cell could not detect any operators, zero, nada! Down there is GSM. Imagine, me with a rental car and NO GPS, NO SERVICE !! Looking deeper, I have the SM-S908U model (for U.S.) and seems like they have another S22 Ultra (international model) so , seems like or my cell has a big problem or the Samsung advertising is very shady because this cell supposed to work with all bands....not true. So, I had to purchase a cheaper cellphone with prepaid service in Brazil in order to have service and hot spot to my S22...L A M E !!!! Also, I live in rural zone in U.S., ALWAYS had service with my old S20 Ultra...not with the S22 Ultra, it drops the service almost every 5 minutes or less...duration can be 30 seconds to one hour. So, I have an old S8+ with Straight talk pre paid card that ALWAYS have service for back upBottom line, I pad a lot for a new S22 Ultra and still need keep up two extra cells in order to have all the service in one I had with my S20 Ultra...simply ridiculous, I have reach out to Samsung and Verizon tech support, nearly 22 hours on the phone, we have tried everything in the book (so don't reply asking me if Roaming was on, or if I reset the network....I even reset the whole cellphone) and no help. Verizon resolution was...the phone is bad. Replacement will be a refurbished, just a little 2 months old and I will need replace for a used and refurbished.......that will have the same problemsIT IS NOT A MATTER OF SOFTWARE UPDATE, IT SEEMS HARDWARE PROBLEM and probably Samsung will not do anything about, like they did nothing with ALL S8+ screens getting red. Sorry for long rant, I am just too stressed about cellphones, thanks Samsung!Unhappy Galaxy S22 ULTRA	R

Crashing: Samsung Health and Smartthings on Galaxy S22	Samsung Health and Smartthings keep crashing on my Galaxy S22. I think it has something to do with creating a map/geo or location services:-Samsung Health: Crashes only when: 1) launching a new workout that uses geo (running, walking cycling), 2) viewing an old workout that generates a map of the workout (again running, walking). Non-geo workouts work fine-Smartthings: Crashes on launch while it's trying to load the "Smartthings Find" mapI have tried a ton of different things to fix this:-Location services are on-permissions are allowed-deleted reinstalled apps-cleared cache for these apps-cleared play services cache and data <-- with this the apps do work temporarily, but then go back to crashing-Factory reset my phone, did not restore dataNothing seems to work. I've been on the phone with Samsung 4 times. They said a developer would call me back to create a log. They haven't called me. I've called again, they told me the same thing, it's been a week.Does anyone else have this problem or know what's causing it?	R
4K Movies NOT supported	So I just purchased 4K movies to watch on my S22 Ultra and I come to find out it's NOT supported the movies are capable but my phone's not.Seems like false advertising to me since Samsung always gloating about 4K and 8k videos to record but before I jump the gun does anyone know if there is something I maybe missing?UPDATE for clarification since I have had a harassing troll in the group. As I do KNOW and have stated " seems like false advertising " is NOT a statement of fact to be it simply is my opinion of such because I had learned after pasting this that the S22 series can only reach 1440P. I consider this half functionality because technically it is since the display cannot produce the same resolution that is capable of being recorded.There are other cellphones with 4K displays within the same price point and slightly cheaper. Although Samsung has a decent user interface the point is to show existing products that can compete with Samsung for content performance. Yes, people can't visually see the difference but the point is Rather paying for half functionality ( 4K recording with no 4K play back) a person could receive that performance from other cellphones for similar price points (Sony).Such a discussion is ok to be had as it opens technological dialogue in the community. Ultimate this is one I find interesting and should be had since we pay for 4K and 8K recording. Again this is a discussion post as well as a discovery post for myself and those who may not know.I do not condone harassment or misrepresentation of anything anyone says here.

Tiny red blinking dot on my s22 ultra screen	I received my s22 ultra yesterday and today noticed that there's a tiny red dot that blinks on the middle right of the screen. If I touch the screen it goes away but again comes back within few seconds.I believe it might be related to 120 htz setting. Any suggestions how to fix this. Very annoying 😒	R
Video recording no longer working	After the latest software update, my S22 Ultra won't take video. Snapchat won't record video (it stops and takes a picture) and the camera app itself won't record (press record, counter shows 0:00 and doesn't save footage). The fix? Restarting it. Then it comes back again, restart it. So on and so on.I've tried:Clearing cache data on boot menuRepairing apps on boot menuClearing cache on camera appupdating all apps to most recent versionsIt helps for a little while, but then back to not being able to record. Taking pictures works perfectly fine in all apps, just can't record.	R
Wifi stability issues	Has anyone experienced any wifi issues with there device? I had just purchased mine with Verizon a month ago and few days after my wifi would keep dropping on my phone. I did network analysis and even tech support on my home wifi to see if that was the issue and they said it was my device as all my other devices never had any issues. The issue among wifi drop was also very slow speeds as in around 1-9mbps when all my other devices showed 300+. I had to get a replacement as Verizon rep at store said I can just swap as it was only a few days since I bought it. Now my new one just 3 weeks old is having exact issues with sluggish wifi and dropping all the time?	R

S22 Ultra is HORRIBLE	"Is anyone else having a ton of issues with their S22 ultra?   I've been a Samsung phone user for years, dating back to before the Note 3.   This has been the most expensive phone and without a doubt the worst phone.  The amount of bugs are ridiculous.  For instance, the assistant pops up on its own ALL the time.  Can be sitting in complete silence and it pops up.  The sensor that shuts the screen off when you bring the phone up to your face (which I have shut off) constantly turns itself on and requires a reboot to fix.  Periodically, the keyboard goes absolutely insane and hovering over it with my hand, about 3 or 4 inches away from the phone and the screen reacts and often closes out the keyboard as if I physically hit the back button.    
One day it will take a few seconds to send a video via RCS, other days it will take 5 to 10 minutes for similar sized video, even when my wife is in the house with me, it will sometimes do this. 
The screen scratching is a joke.  In just days the screen looked like it was a 2 year old phone as my screen protector got delayed and I received the phone first.  Battery has been progressively getting worse.  I have the battery optimized setting set to battery saver in the game launcher menu.  The keyboard is so inaccurate that it takes 3 minutes to sometimes send a basic text and voice to text is a complete joke now.   It's unusable. 
All in all, it's been a horrible phone.  And I had the privilege of spending over $1200 for it.   
Is this all Android 12 rearing it's ugly head (minus garbage screen that scratches)?   Is this phone a lemon?   Or is the S22 Ultra just the most hyped piece of garbage to hit the market?"	R

New 2nd May update issues/improvements	"New 2nd May update which hit today.
No improvement noticable in heating and performance during benchmarks and intensive tasks.
Issues still not fixed in this patch -
1. HDR brightness aggressive flickering in low ambient light is still not fixed.
2. Micro stutters in ui are still there no improvement there.
3. Video playback still drops frames in 120hz mode ( To fix this set the phone to 60hz while watching movies/shows to reduce stutters ). This isn't noticable in 60fps videos due to already high frame rate of video. And as we watch most of the content in 24/30 fps and any drop is more noticable at that low frame rate.
4. Camera shutter lag looks the same no change there."	R

my s22 ultra is shit	"The touch screen works worse than any phone I've ever used 
Taps sometimes register about 5mm away from where I actually touched(even with a macro so im not just clumsy) or register as a double click or not at all this makes it so hard to type sometimes 
While keeping my finger still the screen will register a lot of movement making draging something across the screen or scrolling with the space bar painful 
While typing it sometimes senses a swipe causing me to type random numbers or the wrong number
The swipe to text feature sometimes cuts out mid swipe causing me to type random letters 
Taping to turn the phone off takes to many tries 
When changing from landscape to portrait by swipping out of an app the visuals switch quicker than the actual location of the button causing  me to open apps up to 1cm away from where I clicked 
The auto correct just doesn't do anything half the time
The curved screen makes part of the screen unusable and causes the s pen to slip 
Swipping out of an app can take 20 tries sometimes 
The last 5% lasts less than a minute 
Apps like settings wont save the page you were on even if you leave for only a second 
If you turn down the brightness turn your phone off and back on again(not shutting down ) and turn it back on the brightness will start brighter than you left it and eventually darken instead of saying the same brightness you put it
If you swipe a pip to the outside of the screen it takes up to much space 
I've restarted it many times sometimes it helps sometimes it makes it worse

S22 ultra battery	We all know the battery life is not the best. But when it gets to 5 percent... it drains like one percent every 10 seconds	R
The reason why S22 Ultra battery is draining so fast is....	"High CPU and no matter if there is activity or not at all 8 cores!!!
CPU range:
3x 400-2,52mhz
4x 400-1,82mhz
1x 400-2,80mhz
By CPU-Z:
CPU 0/1/2/3 is running for a few seconds at 400mhz, but in most time between 768-1152mhz!
CPU 4/5/6 in zero activity moment always at 1440mhz!
If Samsung improve firmware for disable 4 cores in locked mode and without active opened apps (like browser, downloading &amp; etc), and the rest 4 cores let running maximally at 400-800mhz, then your battery will be more alive!
Also, I think if you are just viewing internet, you ""don't need"" all 8 cores in such high frequencies. They must improve how must work cores by your activity."	R
S22 unable to activate eSIM on Verizon	After working with a Verizon representative, it seems that I am unable to get the eSim activated on my unlocked S22, purchased here in the US. I provided the IMEI2(eSim) but the rep said the ICCID (beginning. with 89) was not recognized. I attempted to activate the eSim online myself, and got as far as the ICCID - the online instructions stated the ICCID should begin with 89 and be 20 characters in length. The only number that my S22 displays and starts with 89 is the EID and it is much longer than 20 characters. The rep tried all the numbers I provided, both the numbers. found in the "About Phone" section of the S22 and by dialing the *#62# number. Still no luck, I am left to use my S22 on wifi only and my old phone for data and messaging. Really frustrating and disappointing. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks	R

Samsung Pass Unavailable & 2 apps	I just upgraded my S20 to the S22. However on the new phone whenever Samsung Pass pops up and asks if I want to save a password, if I select 'Save', I get a message saying 'Samsung Pass is temporarily unavailable. Try again later'. If I try to open Samsung Pass or go to settings for the app I get a wheel spin before the same 'unavailable' message shows.So I googled and one recommendation was to clear the cache...it was there I noticed that there are 2 Samsung Pass apps in my apps list now...its duplicated somehow! I cleared cache anyway and also updated both the Samsung Account and Samsung Pass apps but the problem still persists...Update: Ive since tried to uninstall updates for Samsung Pass and reinstall them. This got rid of the dupe app in my apps list but the 'unavailable' error still exists...also tried using on mobile data instead of wifi as one post I saw online suggested this. Also tried restarting phone and clearing data for the app as well as the cache. Tried force stopping app. No resolution for me. Noticed its now an issue on my old S20 too. Cant uninstall and reinstall because no uninstall option in app settings.Update #2 - Live chatted w Samsung support who ended up concluding the only option was a factory reset. So did this. But the app still wont launch...Ive been looking at this for hours and am really beginning to regret sticking with Samsung when I upgraded...	R

Samsung knew about the problem and wanted me to leave my phone with a technician in Lexington, SC 2 hours away from my house. They said when the problem occurred again they would attempt to fix it and then send me a new one. They would not provide a loaner so I just said nope. I do too much work on my phone I can't have one that wipes itself whenever it wants. I like Android, I think I'll try the Razer phone. Sorry I am a reddit noob, can't figure out how to post a pic and I can't use this phone with everything reset, lol.	R
Trouble getting crisp photos	I've seen some of the photos taken by the s22 (no +, no ultra), and I'm worried that my camera is broken. My kids face is often blurred, even when he is perfectly still, and the selfie camera can get as crispy shots, if not even crispier. Should I apply for a new device? Anybody else have a similar experience?	R
S22 overheating, defective?	"I've had my S22(snapdragon) for 12 days now and the performance and battery is terrible. I have uninstalled all the apps I do not use, turned off plenty of features that I do not use and have added most of my apps that I do not use frequently to the sleeping apps list and turned off 5g and I am still having overheating issues.
On two occasions I have been using my phone for navigation with Google maps when the phone closes Maps and says that it is overheating and I need to wait for it to cool down to use it again. This has not happened on any other phone I have used and is a massive design flaw. I am unable to use the phone for one of its main purposes. My worry is that it is only going to be getting hotter as summer progresses and that my phone will be completely unusable for Google Maps.
I know these chips run extremely hot but has this happened to others? Is my unit defective? Is there any news on a recall for these devices?"	R

Chrome apps will not send notifications to new 22S Ultra phone	I just purchased the new Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra phone and none of my Chrome apps are able to send me notifications. There is a Google message that is always there to have me "Accept" all of its permissions to view, track, see everything I do on my phone. I have Not given them the "Accept" and I wonder if that's why I am not receiving any notifications from Google/Chrome? Any suggestions?? Thanks.	R
Haptic feedback on Samsung keyboard	I'm not getting any vibration from the keyboard even though I have it set up for it. I don't think the keyboard has got better since the update. I gave it a go, I'm back on Gboard. Swyping still not very accurate. I like the features, but I think it would be a better keyboard if they focused on the basics.	R
Proximity sensor issue S22 ultra	Hi,I recently bought a glalxy S22 ultra, and I noticed a problem with its proximity sensor.It works fine when I use it on a Call i.e. when I am on a call and get the proximity sensor close to anything, the screen goes blank, but when I use any application that uses proximity sensor such as "proximity sensor counter", it does not work properly. That is, when the application is on and I put my hand next to the proximity sensor, my hand is not detected, and the only way that my hand is detected in the proximity sensor counter app is when my hand touches the screen and covers the top part of it.Can anyone help by telling me what the problem can be?	R
S22 Ultra Camera and Video Quality	So I've upgraded from the s21 ultra to the s22 ultra. Video and camera quality doesn't look better than what the s21 ultra had to offer. My pictures and video don't come out sharp, the colors look sluggish. When I take pictures of the moon with the 100x zoom feature, it come south more sluggish than what the s21 ultra can capture. I can compare the 2 since I transfered my gallery from the 21 to the 22. Please samsung fix and improve the camera and video camera qualities. I feel like I downgraded on the camera only. Everything else about the phone I really enjoy.	R

S22 camera noise gets worse on low light setting and slow motion mode	My s22 produces quite a lot of noise when I shoot on low light condition, and it gets worse on slow motion mode. Has anyone experience the same thing? And is there anyway to actually fix this? Up is the screenshot of the video recorded previously	R
Custom ringtones and notification tones keep disappearing	The ringtones and custom message tones I put in my Ringtones folder keep disappearing, this has happened over 5 times now in the few months I've had an S22 Ultra, never had this issue on a previous device.I've tried searching for this issue, and found a couple of threads which seem like have a similar issue, but I'm unable to either see the thread or the replies, that I don't have permission to or whatever.

S22 Ultra Bluetooth Sound is Extremely Low	Hi,It's been less than a month I bought my new S22 Ultra 512 GB, but it was today that I actually wanted to use my Level U earphone via Bluetooth to listen to some music (it was Samsung gift for buying the phone). However, I noticed that the sound, albeit the quality was high, was far too low to feel any enjoyment listening to it.After I surfed the Net I've come to understand that it is a prevalent problem to all S22 users. The only suggestion by users was to activate "Disable Absolute Volume", which, in my case, nothing changing at all; the sound remains as low as it was before, although the sound quality might have improved (& ofc, the volume is at maximum too).So, any suggestions? I mean, come on, for a 1300$ smartphone & Samsung's newest Flagship this is one big of a problem, without any official reply to fix it. 😥🥺I appreciate for any help you can provide.😇Regards,Pejman	R
My NEW S22 Ultra is Needing Constant Reboots for Sounds & Camera to Work Properly	"After some hours of use, my notification sounds will just stop playing. Eventually, my alarm and timer sounds ALSO stop working. It'll just vibrate (yes, I have the vibrate option turned off). When I go to check the volumes, and actual sounds, the volume is okay, but I'll get random errors on the audio files like ""sound file is not supported"" or ""player had a problem playing this file"" - along those lines when I try to preview new sounds to see what the issue is. 
Next, the camera will also stop being able to record video. It'll just sit there without the timer moving and nothing happening. I've seen this become a bug upon other Google searches. 
A reboot fixes all of this, but I'm doing it multiple times a day! I just got this phone and set it up at the end of April 2022. 
I always first clear the cache and storage of the affected apps before I do a reboot. I've also double checked all sound and notification settings. There's no telling when it happens, I just happen to notice things aren't working (such as an alarm to wake up! I just happened to hear my phone vibrating...) when they are supposed to. 
I did a Samsung cloud restore from my S8+ plus when I first received my S22 Ultra, so it's been a big upgrade for me. 
I haven't installed any new apps recently, either. So I'm not sure where to even start with diagnosing this problem."	R
External Mic Issues	"Has anyone had any luck getting an external mic to work on the S22u? I've tried a couple different mics with a couple different USB-C to 3.5mm adapters (including the Samsung branded one) but I'm getting no sound. The phone seems to recognize the Samsung adapter at least, and even tries to change the microphone input to USB, but then it freezes the camera app until I close it. Hey trying to figure this out for a few days and was hoping someone else has already figured this out? 
The goal is to get the Rode Micro lav to work."	R
Protect Battery mode did not work	"Hi everyone,
So every night I put my phone jntk protect battery mode. For some odd reason it didn't work last night and charged all the way. Just wondering why this could be and if anyone else is or has experienced this issue as well?

New phone, new to ATT....numerous issues!	"Just joined here. Picked up my S22 Ultra yesterday from ATT (had Verizon before). Lots of growing pains, but also some major issues. Yesterday I couldn't call at all, in or out. Seems to work today.   
Text messages are also broken. I can receive them, but can't respond or create a new one. Also noticed that there is no phone icon on the text thread, not sure if this is due to ATT's design.  
Also a major issue for me, tried connecting the phone to my pc to upload 20 gigs of music. The process stops every time. Even tried a few files at once, the transfer always freezes at some point, required I pull the cord and start again. I hate the omission of removable storage, and this is one of the reasons!  
Any suggestions for a new user? Had the Note 8 before. This one looks great, but is getting quite frustrating."	R
Instagram not working with s22U?	"Nothing seems to want to load properly. I've tried turning the phone on and off. Clearing the cache. Uninstalling. What gives? How do I fix this? Everything is blank and trying to load like 60% of the time. 
I also noticed on fb messenger when I send audio messages or receive them, the last 15 seconds or so gets cut off. I can't hear that part at all. Very annoying and I can't figure that out either. 
Is this happening to anyone else?"	R

s22+ Freeze and Crash	"My phone was acting fine earlier today. I updated some apps from the Google play store, and used the phone after just fine. Just now, I was scrolling Instagram but I noticed my scrolls were not actually scrolling and the  phone was lagging. I swapped to device care to try and optimize the phone but it just sat on the screen saying 3 out of 4 systems were optimized, but the 4th closing apps (7) in the background was stuck loading for 5-10 minutes. 
I tried pressing my home button to turn the phone off (which also has a double key for the flashlight) and the phone screen turned off and the flash activated and wouldn't turn off until 5 minutes later when the phone shut off completely. I turned the phone on and ran a security scan which took another 10 minutes (it usually takes a minute or less) and no threats/issues were found.
I've never had an issue like this before, and the phone has the most recent OS updates. I do however have a third party app not through Google play/Galaxy Store (Tap Tap, and a couple popular apps from it which ive had installed for almost a month now)
Battery was ~63%, model number is SM-S906U1. Has anyone else had any similar problems?"	R

S22 Ultra freezing up since May Android update	I have experienced several freezing up situations with the UI on my S22 Ultra since I got the most recent security update for May. Sometimes I get an error from UI stating that I can wait for the action to complete or cancel.Other situations completely freeze up and not at a common point in the app.Very random.At times I need to force a reboot if the screen doesn't come back to life. Other instances involve it going totally blank, but the phone is still running - notifications vibrate, the phone rings, but the screen stays dark until I force a reboot.Is anyone else experiencing this or know of a fix??Thanks in advance.

Missing apps in the app drawer	"So, I'm noticing that lately, apps I download from the Play store are not populating in my app drawer as they should. I've checked hidden apps, the and Game Launcher, and the Secure folder and have disabled the latter 2 in attempts to troubleshoot. The weird thing is I can type the name of the apps into the app drawer search and it finds them. I'm using the American Red Cross Blood Donor app as en example in my attachments, but it's not the only app affected. 
Anyone else experiencing anything similar? Only other variable is I'm using Good Lock to force vertical scrolling in the app drawer and home screen looping."	R

S22 ULTRA NOT CONNECTING TO AT&amp;T NETWORK	"Hi guys,
I'm having trouble with my phone not connecting to the network.  It only works over my wifi and wifi calling now.  It worked just fine until I went out of town barely a week ago and then just started cutting out.  It shows 5G and bars are usually full, but still won't let me make calls or send text messages. Talked to AT&amp;T yesterday and they sent a reset signal and I also reset my network settings, but still won't work.  Went to the AT&amp;T store yesterday and put in new SIM card and worked fine away from my house.   I live in the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex, so I'm not out in BFE.   Not sure what to do, but any help would be greatly appreciated."	R
This phone is terrible. How is it so well reviewed?	"Got my new S22 ultra (tmobile 512GB). And so far I'm not impressed. 
Battery life is piss poor. 1hr 15min screen on time and I'm at 40% . My 4yr old Note with same usage in same work day gets me better!!  The finger print reader is inferior to my old phone, I hate it. Wifi will very reliably lose internet connectivity ( apparently a known bug) and this phone drops 5G signal constantly ( despite signal being strong...)and gets worse speed and signal than my old phone. 
I'm really not sure what upgrade I got here? Camera is nicer and screen is smoother and...that's about all I gotta say about it. Thinking of returning. How is this device so well reviewed?"	R
Phone really tested my patience the last couple of days	"Not sure if it's because of the last update but I've had two ""critical"" failures with system apps, which I find a little silly.
One, the camera, when I was trying to video my girlfriend walking down the stage to get her degree, the video didn't record. It would look like it was recording but the timer didn't turn red and progress. Saw similar issues online and wiping cache/rebooting fixed. Still, I missed this very important moment for her because of it.
Next, this morning, my alarm didn't go off, and when I tried to access a ringtone it said the audio file wasn't supported. Had to wipe cache and reboot, and it worked.
I've never had issues like this before, I'm on the May system update with a May 1 security patch, is this just bugginess from the update?
This is on top of my earpiece speaker sounding like it's a little broken, and lots of issues with calls breaking up.
Usually I'm pretty understanding of issues with my tech but when you miss important moments in your life, I can't help but wonder if an iphone would be more stable for those important things, despite me not liking the experience.
P.S. Galaxy S22+ Unlocked"	R

Touch screen delay and unresponsiveness on the sides of the display (S22)	"Hello I've been using my S22 for a couple of months and everything seemed fine except for a slight difficulty in pulling the edge panel or side panels in apps like reddit sync, I could live with it and I was hoping it was a matter to be resolved via software updates. 
However as of today the problem persists and I've also noticed that scrolling from the very left or the very right of the display (I'd say it's about half a cm of horizontal space at most) results in a noticeably delayed reaction to my scrolling... Not so noticeable as to be recognisable during everyday use but noticeable and replicable anywhere nonetheless. This makes me think that the issue is a hardware one rather than a faulty edge touch protection mechanism or some other software issue.
I've already tried the usual easy fixes like safe mode, enabling or disabling touch sensitivity, changing the refresh rate, removing my screen protector and case to no avail.
I'm about to ask support for a replacement but first I'd like to know if there's anyone else with my same issue and what they did to try to fix it, hence my post here; thanks for taking the time to read."	R
phone calls not working	"Hi, 
I'm super angry after returning to a galaxy phone. I'm slowly regret buying one after my pixel.
I can't make or get calls!
Participants can't hear me and I can't hear anybody. I tried to deaktivate VoLTE, deaktivate 5G and even switch to google phone app. Doesn't work. If I turn on WLAN Phone, that works and Whatsapp calls no matter if in WLAN or on cellular...

Any ideas fixes?"	R
Cellular connection much worse after May 2022 update	This happening to anyone else?	R
love my S22 Ultra but..	"I know there are many posts like this. Regarding battery life etc. 
So I made a more comprehensive approach to it: 
Breakdown of usage and see how it compares relative to others usage. 
Setup: S22 Ultra 120hz adaptive @ WQHD+ with notifcaion sounds off, haptic feedback on keyboard only (low medium setting), AOD on from 8 AM to 8 PM. 
I get around 4.5 hours of SOT from a full day's of usage. What is a full day of usage for me ?
Messages (stock samsung Google app)
Snapchat 
Instagram browsing 
Reddit 
YouTube maybe if I wanna watch a quick video or 2. 
Spotify 
Google Maps for commuting traffic check in the morning and a few times before I leave work (don't actually use the navigation , just map the route to see times and traffic).
Quick Facebook browsing 
Bluetooth is on all day and paired with my garmin watch (notifications push are off however so it's not constantly syncing)
Battery saver is off, nfc is off, all notifications off (no vibration either)
I don't think 4.5 hours on a 5000mah cell is justified at all. I should get at least 5.5 hours but preferably 7.5 or higher. 
My Z fold 3 with similar usage used to get me around 6.25 hours per day but that's 80% using outside small screen and 20% using big screen. 
What do I love about rhe S22 ultra thoguh ? Many things: cameras (just wow) best I've ever had on a phone, haptic feedback is amazing, screen is amazing.. people always look at my phone and are starstruck how high the resolution is and how crispy everything looks, social media integration natively with cameras,  samsung good lock, one hand operation and all the hidden goodies inside those , S pen usage, Knox security, samsung pass. Tbh I didn't really realize how integrated I was into the samsung eco system until I tried another phone for a bit.. now I kind of understand how apple users feel when they leave or think of going to Android devices. But yea samsung and android is still awesome. Also samsung really hit the nail in the coffin in terms of competition with their 4 years OS updates and 6 years security updates. Bravo"	R

Galaxy S22 Ultra defective screen	Hello guys,Has anyone else notice their screen on the S22ultra is super soft compared to the previous generations of Gorilla Glass? I have taken the factory screen protector off, as it was bothering me, and within a few day I noticed micro scratches all over the phone, even last week noticing deeper gouging on the screen. Nothing I would do would constitute those scratches being there, and surely not that deep of scratches. I've reach out to Samsung support and their solutions were useless. Either 1. Go to a local repair center, and have them repair it, but all the local repair centers have refused to do the repair because of current issues with Samsung RMA team. And option 2. Was send in the phone, but they are 3-4 weeks behind so be without a phone for a month. Is anyone else having this issue?	R
Is there a way to get internal temp displayed?	Hi guys, I just upgraded to a Galaxy S22. I am actually on my second unit because my first one got too hot while recording video and caused me to lose footage of my nephew's college graduation ceremony. And 2 days later it heated up again. After the store initially refused to exchange devices(I was, and currently still am in the 30 day exchange period), I called customer care and they ran diagnostics. They noted a 25 degree temperature increase just from taking 4 photos and advised me to return the the device and to call them immediately if the store refused to honor the return policy again.Fortunately this second time they honored it maupin seeing the notes left on my account by the customer care rep and me giving further detailsI had accubattery kick off a hot temp alarm in store, so they exchanged.This device seems to be doing some better, but it still feels like it gets a tad warm for the activity it's doing. Is there a way to get into the system to get a temperature readout without having to use a third party app such as Accubattery?Overall I'm quite happy with the way the device has done when it's worked properly and have had no dangerous temp issues with the replacement unit like I did with the initial unit. Screen is crisp and photos are brilliant, network speed is wicked fast on 5g, and the phone is appeasing to the eyes-- rounded rectangle design, and my particular unit is green, my favorite color and about my favorite hue of green as well.It getting warm(albeit bot dangerously so now) has me wondering if there is a way to get a temp readout through the system.It's been a 9/10 experience so far, with the defective unit notwithstanding.

Messages don't send	S22 Ultra on T-Mobile. I use Google messages for texts. I constantly get the message that texts "were unable to send". Then I have to hit the message again to resend it. That might happen a few times before it sends. It doesn't matter if I'm on 5g or wifi. Switched to Samsung messages...same issue. New Sim card when I bought the phone 2 months ago too. It's getting aggravating since I use my phone to talk with clients all day long.	R

Fingerprint not working?	Hi,I got an S22 Ultra. Installed a Whistone Dome 2 weeks ago, re-registered my fingerprint after the installation. Worked perfectly for 2 weeks.Tonight, it stopped working, don't know why. No fingerprint (I have 4 registered) are working. Decided to remove them all and re-registered them.I am totally unable to register any fingerprint, as if the fingerprint sensor just stopped working? Just ask me to press harder or to move my finger?Is there any bug with the may S22 update that kicked in recently?	R
I think I found my battery killer	"It has Eemed like every few minutes I've looked in device care ive seen a 2 hour decrease in expected battery life time. And I see in the background  Verizon Cloud has been goinf almost 10 hours in the background today!!!! That cannot possibly be normal.  
I wouls think with the way my battery has rapidly depreciated today, that is almost certainly responsible. Nothing else had background use more than 10 minutes. 
I knew something had to be amiss because despite turning WiFi off, auto sync off, running dark mode, screen down. To about 30% brightness, Bluetooth off, NFC off, and other various wireless connections such as android Beam being off, my battery absolutely should not have depreciated like this today. In fact with me dialing everything down/off I was expecting improvement. 
Looks like I found the culprit. Hopefully this can be stopped manually."	R
Camera Lag	So I'm not sure if it's just my phone or if anyone else is also facing this issue but I bought the phone 2 weeks ago and the camera lags a lot especially in video, and if I use zoom then it just drops down to -10 fps which is just unbearable, The phone doesn't last too long but Ig that's cuz of the display, but the camera lag is frustrating, Is anyone else having this issue or should I return my device marked as defective?	R
Apps keep signing me out automatically.	"Hey guys!

Update Unsuccessful		R
H.265 on S22 Ultra	"I have DS Cam (Synology surveillance) and the cameras on the NVR are set to H.265. Until 3 days ago, it worked fine. After S22 software upgrade and DS Cam upgrade, the H.265 no longer displays on the phone.
I understand that H.265 is not a supported format, however, before the latest upgrades, it was working.
Any thoughts on solution other than changing all surveillance cameras back to H.264"	R
Signal and internet connection is worse	"I don't know what it is but literally signal and internet connection since updates have gotten worse.

Is this something that could be fixed or?"	R
Samsung Galaxy s22 Ultra Video / music issue	"I've been having two weird issues with my phone recently. The first one is that my phone has been automatically turning down the volume when playing music or videos. I normally have it a full volume (not connected to bluetooth or anything) and it will randomly turn itself down to 75-50% volume.
The second issue I've been having (most recently) is that when I'm watching youtube or playing music on spotify, the music or video will just pause itself. Not entirely sure why it does that and I cant replicate the issue"	R
is the battery still learns my usage? cause battery management feels aggressive	Hello i have factroy reset my s22 ultra for 5 days now and the learning usage pattern is done now but u feel there is aggressive battery management done in the background as there is some function loads after i unlock my phone like bixby routines the set up routin takes some time to load and to stop and also the automation like auto restart and auto optimize not working at all so idk if it's battery management related issue or it's fixable specially all pf those were working fine befor factory resets	R

Google results not precise	"So annoying.  When I search for anything near me it pulls search results from an area I was at earlier.  I cleared cache of Google and maps. Nothing works to give me precise location results.  When I restart its ok but shouldn't have to constantly restart my phone.
No issues when I use Google maps for directions.
Any help??"	R
Has anyone found a fix for the swype typing bug introduced in the April update that's made swype typing almost unusable on the S22Ultra? Is there a way to roll back to March until they fix this?	Going insane not being able to complete a swype without the phone freaking out and interrupting as if I lifted my finger. I assumed this would be an instant fix in the May update but nothing...	R
Unable to stop task killer from closing apps in the background.	"I've been noticing that there seems to be no way to prevent whatever task killer is active in the UI from killing my apps in the background. It's evident for me when using Waze for instance. AccuBattery also reports being interfered by it. I've tried disabling adaptive battery, adding and removing the apps from restricted/suspended apps lists and changing the battery settings on each app to unrestricted. Nothing seems to work.
I thought it was a specific issue with my S22+ but after updating my S21 device to the latest software it began acting the same. 
Anyone having similar issues? Thanks"	R
having issues with Google Assistant	I just switched from the iPhone 12 to the Galaxy S22 Ultra, I'm loving thos phone so far but having one issue with this phone. Whenever I'm listening to music or having a conversation with somebody my phone will randomly pull up Google Assistant acting as if I said "Okay Google" when I didn't. It's pretty annoying when it does this especially when I am listening to music and stops my entire song. It does this quite often. How do I fix this??	R

RCS through Microsoft's Phone Link App not working	Anyone else not able to use RCS texting through the Phone Link app on Windows? I saw multiple articles that the Phone Link app (formally Your Phone) supports RCS for select Galaxy devices, including the S22. However, while RCS works fine if I'm texting from my phone, whenever I text through the Phone Link app, it reverts back to SMS. I find this super annoying and I'm not sure if the issue is with the Phone Link app, the Phone, or my carrier (Cricket - mvno built on ATT). Anyone else use the Phone Link app - are you able to RCS?

S22 ultra not connecting to network that is lower than 5G	Since day one of receiving my S22 ultra I have been having issues with the phone not connecting to a NON 5g network. I have gone through all of the trouble shooting steps with both my carrier and Samsung(network reset/factory reset/switching on and off airplane mode/changing to 4g or lower network). I was then told I could send it in but if they don't find an issue it would be sent back (can take up to 8 weeks).I am just so confused as to why this is a problem when my zfold 3 did not have this issue at all. Hopefully someone can shed some light on the situation.	R

starkey ai edge 2400 hearing aid streaming issue	My S22 updated on the 17th of May, since that date my hearing aids have stopped streaming. I cannot listen to phone calls, play music on Spotify and I can't hear movies on Disney channel. Anyone got any ideas. I am fed up as I need them so I can hear calls as I struggle through normal handsets without thrive app which is the starkey app. I can change memory setting and it gives me voice notification when I do this but I can't anything else when streaming.	R
Bluetooth connect	Neither my Bluetooth headset nor my hearing aids remain connected to the s22 ultra even though the apps and settings say they are paired and connected. My hearing aids will connect and then randomly drop connection. My headset says paired but no audio. At the same time, the phone has no audio either. Never had this problem with my previous Samsung Note 10+ phone but have had it with this one since day one. Unsat.	R

Text and group messaging not working	I bought my Samsung Ultra 22 back in March. Since then, I'm hit or miss with group text. I've been on the phone with T-Mobile for hours over hours and have been in the store multiple times switching out sim cards. I was there today for over 2 and 1/2 hours have the Tmobile girl trouble shoot with tech support, plus google tech support. This is ABSOLUTELY ridiculous. I have been a long time loyal Samsung Galaxy buying since the first one came out. Everyone I know owns an Apple but I've so loyal and I'm starting to regret it. I need to get this rectified immediately. That does not mean, send me a screen shot and move on. I need some at a very high level to jump on my phone or do something and if it can't get fixed, I want a new phone or I'll move on. I own my own business and this is my business phone. I am actually losing money with this.	R
Need help with a problem.	I just got the s22 ultra and I'm finding a few annoying bugs that my older note 9 phone didn't have. One being the Samsung keyboard. I keep a journal in Google docs and it is a larger file. Whenever I type I keep getting the same annoying message pop up that covers up what I'm typing that says "can't detect more grammar errors. Text is too long" I can't figure out how to get rid of it or even move it. Also if someone could tell me resolve another bug that would be awesome. On my old phone my clock/alarm/timer/stopwatch app would push all alarms and timer alerts to my active 3 watch. The new phone will push only alarms alerts. I can't figure that one out either and apparently neither can the Samsung employees who run the text an agent trouble shooting department. Any help would be greatly appreciated!	R
Messaging on apps issue	When your messaging, once you have finnished, and you are proof reading then you see an error, you move the curser to the location that needs correction but the curser ALWAYS reverts back to the end of that message as soon as you try to correct the mistake.

s22 ultra bluetooth audio problems	Hello guys, I recently bought a s22 ultra and I'm having problems with the audio quality coming from the Bluetooth, it sounds fine with my buds pro but when I connect it to my car (2014 Corolla) it sounds distorted, I already tried changing the codec, restart the phone, use a different music app (it affects any Bluetooth output) and nothing works, I previously had a Oneplus 8 and I didn't had this problem, I believe that this is unacceptable for a $1200 smartphone, I'm thinking about return it if I can't fix it, any suggestions?	R
Outlook and Gmail Notifications	"Just got a S22 on Saturday (coming from a Pixel 6).  Outlook and Gmail are both wonky.
Outlook - I get the emails but no notifications. All notifications are allowed in the app, battery saver and do not disturb are off.  Anything else?  It's not delayed because as soon as I open the app all my new emails are there without any delay. 
Gmail - opposite problem. I don't get the emails for like 5 to 10 minutes after I see them received on the desktop, then I do get a notification on my S22. 
Any ideas?"	R
anyone else's s22 ultra slow WAY down during GPS usage.	"I took a road trip that was about 800 miles. I was running Google maps with android auto on. I was going back and fourth between Spotify  and YouTube.  .you s22 ultra slowed down so much it wasn't even usable at times.  Just to open the texting app would take solid 5 solids. Camera app was just as worse. 
My question is do you think this is a heating issue or just simply not having enough RAM to run Maps and other apps in the background?? I have the 8/128 model."	R

Videos and vibration suddenly not working	So suddenly out of nowhere, my vibrations stopped working for notifications, calls and texts. The vibration motor still works when I test it, but otherwise I don't get any vibrations. At the same time, all my videos on snapchat, Instagram, and reddit stopped loading/playing. I cleared the cache for all the apps and reinstalled, and nothing is helping. Any ideas what's going on? This phone is turning into a steaming pile of shit	R
Unable to ignore "do not disburb" (DND) for app in secure folder	This all worked on my S20. Since upgrading to the S22 I cannot get an app installed in the secure folder to ignore DND. When I go to DND in settings and try to add apps, I see the app I want to add with the secure folder symbol in the corner of the icon. When I click on the icon it already has all of the notification categories checked off. I turned them off and turned them on, by the app is not added to the list of apps that should ignore do not disturb. I should mention that I do have the same app installed outside of the secure folder. It works correctly on notifications ignoring do not disturb.	R
Speaker inop after flight!	Now I thought I was going crazy, I have flown four or five times since I've bought the S22 Ultra a few months ago. After every flight my speakers would just crackle for the next day or 2 then work fine. By the time I bring it to a repair facility they are working fine. This is obviously an issue seeing that it happened every time I fly, I need my phone after a flight! Anybody else having the same issue?	R

Do not disturb	My do not disturb setting is stuck on in the default setting. I want to edit the setting, but any time I enter settings, click notifications, then click on do not disturb, it takes me back to the original settings menu.

There's a new software update, but still no fix for posting FB Stories 🤬	I just ran the new update on my S22 Ultra. Still no fix for the FB story posting issue. Something is bad with the hardware and software aspect of the Ultra S22 and FB. Now I can't post any reels. My reels are coming up blank too like the FB stories. Seems like some code tinkering is happening. Glad that Samsung finally acknowledged the issue, but we need a resolution. These phones aren't cheap and we deserve an answer. Please Samsung, your loyal consumers are counting on you!	R

Had this problem before we Samsungs	"All of a sudden on Facebook if I dictate and I have to go back and correct errors, hell breaks loose. I could be backspacing to correct a dictation error and instead of erasing what's up against the cursor it erases something else.  Then when I try to add something, the new letters end up at the end of the paragraph. It makes editing a nightmare. He's only seems to be happening on Facebook by the way. 
The other question I have is when you're using the TalkBack accessibility icon, when I had the LG ask me if I want to be able to read pictures. I don't see that here on the Samsung. And if I'm typing something on Twitter I will type a lot more than 280 characters and make it into a JPEG and posted as a picture. That should be able to be red and I think it was by my LG v40. Is there anything I can do to make that happen on the Samsung S21 Ultra?"	R
Phone call volume level too low	"I'm about a week in with the new phone. The one issue I've noticed repeatedly is the volume level during calls. I have it maxed, and using headphones which are also maxed, and it's just barely loud enough. I have issues with the volume being too low without headphones.   
Is this a known issue, or is there some setting that's off?"	R
Smart text selection not working?	"Anyone else experiencing an issue where S22 Ultra (current firmware, got the May update) isn't doing the ""smart text selection"" feature? I think I previously had the ability, but it's gone. Previously, or on other Samsung phones, I could select an address partially and it would highlight the whole address and suggest sending it to a map app, etc. Currently, it isn't working in the same context: phone number suggesting Messages or Phone app, etc. 
Any ideas on how to bring it back?"	R
Volume buttons and vibration stop working randomly and won't work properly unless phone is resetted. On a S22U. Does this happen to anyone else?	I'm on One UI 4.1. So basically after a few hours of not using my phone if I go use it I notice that my phone doesn't have vibrating feedback while typing and my volume buttons don't increase/decrease the volume. I have to reset the phone to fix this. It's been happening this past week. Does this happen to anyone else or any idea what might be causing this?	R

Issue with wifi and/or mobile Hotspot not even turning on when you toggle the switch in settings? (Verizon)	Hi, for some reason when I go to hit wifi to turn it on, it stays on for a split second and flips back off. I contacted Samsung members and they said I would have to take it in. I'm trying to avoid doing this as I just got the phone new and don't love the idea of them working on it so new.	R
s22 ultra, Bluetooth audio pops when audio starts and stops.	"Since I've had the phone I've noticed this issue.
Any time I'm using Bluetooth headphones the phone constantly makes a pop when audio starts and stops.  For instance, if i pause the music for a few seconds when i hit play i get a pop like an amplifier turning back on.  Really noticable scrolling reddit, every time a video post comes on the screen, even paused i get an audio pop like the headphones are turning on. Scroll through some text and image posts dead quiet, hit a video or receive a notification i get an audio pop. 
Tried Same headphones on my old keyocera or wifes apple and this doesn't happen.
I disabled the background power restrictions on Bluetooth, I don't know what keeps shutting off the audio stream to the headphones."	R
Unable to force quit apps	As the title says my phone isn't letting me force quit any apps. I can tap on the force quit option as many times as I want but it never greys out like it's supposed when the app closes. is there a way to fix this?	R
Bitterly disappointed	I was a Samsung believer, until now. Now my grown kids finally seem right, and I should have been an iPhone Pro user. The biometric sensing on the S22 Ultra is literally AWFUL. Should have anty'd up the bucks and made the switch. Have now "invested" in multiple different screen protectors thinking I just had to find the right one that would work, but still disappointed. I am in for a soul crushing few years now before i will change phones again.	R

Another S22+ Speaker Distortion Thread	Count me as one of the individuals experiencing the speaker distortion on my S22+. I got my phone from AT&T less than two weeks ago. I will be going for a return today, but wanted to share some gathered data.After searching various Internet forums, the problem is not isolated to a few phones. It is fairly widespread. I'm hoping it doesn't affect all S22 phones, but it does seem to be a design flaw. The sealed phone is susceptible to internal pressure changes via temperature or actual pressure (airplane flights, etc), and this causes the distortion on the speaker. This is a hardware problem, and I don't think a software fix will be possible.Ejecting the Sim card works to equalize pressure, and the distortion problem will temporarily be fixed.One thing I noticed today was that I had not removed the protective plastic from the edges of the phone. This plastic covered a spot on the right edge of the phone that resembles a location that an SD slot would have been added. It is an indentation on the side of the phone. My hope is that it's some type of pressure equalizing "valve", and the protective plastic was preventing it from working. This is a complete guess on my part, and not confirmed by Samsung or online sources.You can check your own phone by cooling it off and then playing a song or ringtone. If it is distorted, you'll definitely be able to hear it. Phone calls are also affected.I hope Samsung is actively investigating this and that they release a statement soon. They're losing a lot of trust right now.	R

Apps don't auto update | Delayed Signal Messages	"Is anyone else having issues with what I assume is very aggressive battery management making it so that apps never auto update on their own?

Both apps should be completely unrestricted, and work as expected manually, but the background processes don't seem to be working properly."	R

I'm using Aodnotify and have it set so that aod comes on when I get a new notification, but also when I tap it. It works great, when it works.
Sometimes I can tap and nothing happens. Sometimes when it does that, I can tap repeatedly and the phone will wake up. Sometimes I have to hit the power button to wake it up. After it wakes aod works normally for a while.
I Uninstaller Aodnotify to see if it was the problem and it still does it occasionally.

What I did to do this is use the smart switch to transfer (ultra 22 to ultra 22, warranty replacement)
Add widget
then type T then O and it crashes. 
I have since side loaded the app and able to scroll down to it, however if i tried to search T and then type O it will crash."	R
Battery getting worse after a few weeks with adaptive	"I've had this phone (Snapdragon base S22) for like 3ish weeks now and I've been hearing the battery life is much better after the adaptive setting figures out your own usage and optimizes
I am having the opposite experience
[Battery life mid May: 6.5 hours SOT](https://i.imgur.com/Dkg3LVa.jpg) 85% - 49% discharge gave 2h 19m SOT
[Battery life recently: 3 hours SOT](https://i.imgur.com/PyX4Fu6.jpg) 85% - 30% gave 1h 37m SOT
The 3 hours day was particularly confusing, I was using 5G (WiFi turned off, I have tried 4G only and it's almost no difference), *some* Google maps, 50% brightness, 120hz. I switched to 60hz and powersaving mode and now it's 4 hours max.
Either way I have lost at least 2-3 hours SOT over 2 weeks of adaptive and I have no idea why. The only thing ""new"" is I added a work profile to the phone, but the work profile is off the whole day except for maybe 1 hour. I also increased touch sensitivity because I got a screen protector.
I have most of my apps I never open on ""deep sleep"", including whatever it initially recommended (I since turned the auto-recommend off). I have routines that limit charging overnight, and turn on power saving + 60hz in certain apps and below certain battery %. That's it, no power usage..."	R
5G reception on S22+	"I have a S22+ while my wife has an A71 5G. Am on T-Mobile as is my wife. We live in NW Phoenix in a neighborhood that doesn't have the greatest reception, especially inside the home.  What I've come to notice that quite frequently at home (and also in other locations), the wife's A71 5G is showing a 5G signal (N71 with -110 signal strength) while my phone is showing a 4G signal - typically on B12 - with signal strength -115.  In other locations with marginal signal strength, my phone will typically show a weak 4G signal while my wife's phone shows a 5G signal. This has been the situation for some time. When I am in a strong signal area - the S22+ will show a very strong 5G signal. Have even gotten d/l speeds of over 700 Mbs.
In reading various reviews of the S22, much praise was heaped on it by the technical press.  I guess I had higher expectations than the reality I am seeing."	R
This can't be normal	"Yet another battery post.
We talk alot about SOT time, but what about screen \*off\* time?
Right now my snapdragon s22 is at 19% (charging to 85%). My screen on time is 1h41 minutes while the screen \*off\* time is 13h33. I probably listened to 1 hour of Spotify, 30 minutes of phone calls and 1 hour of YouTube with the screen off. 
I wake up at 6am and usually go to bed at 11pm. I consider myself a ""light"" user so I thought this phone would be able to pull it off (even with the criticisms in regards to its battery). Plus, I got it at an amazing deal for $600 CAD (new).
Is this normal behaviour?
I have dark mode, 120Hz and always on display. I've had the phone for 6 days.
Thanks! :)"	R

Assistant app no longer works in Bixby routine (or anywhere)	"I have a Bixby routine set up where I can long-press the power button and it activates the Google Assistant. This routine was dependent on running that little ""Assistant"" app. Worked great until a few days ago. Now if I hold down the power button or click on the Assistant app, I get the screen I pasted below. I can still swipe up from the corner and get the assistant. 
There is no update to the Google app. There was one recently though (possible culprit). I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the Google App updates. Reinstalling the Assistant app. Tried clearing data on both apps. Rebooted phone. Nope.  
I decided to factory reset. Just kidding. Is anyone experiencing this? Any ideas on how to fix it? Just wait for the next update? Thanks!  "	R

Issue with .heic and lightroom	"got the phone back in March. I took 90% of photos in .heic format. Today I wanted to try and edit some photos in Lightroom (windows). After importing, the colors were terrible blues became cyans, browns became oranges, etc.. I was shocked but I saw some photos which were in .jpg format, and they were color accurate. So I went outside and took two photos one in jpg and the other in heic, they look very different, .heic photos look as if a filter is applied.
This color difference is only seen in Lightroom and not in the windows Photos app.
Tried posting this yesterday but was removed as spam.

Shutter Lag	"There seems to be a bit of delay when taking shots with the S22Ultra.
For comparison, I can continuously press the shoot button on iPhone 13 Pro and it will take photos without any lag.

Does anyone else feel the lag ?	"I am on the s22 ultra base model (8gb ram , 128 GB ). I have been using it for a month now. Switched for iphone for some apple detox. So far I am not happy about it.
Firstly, there is a lot of lag and stuttering animations in simple apps like Google maps and Gmail. Launcher and app switcher animations seems to stutter too. 
Camera app is extremely laggy. The shutter button only responds after a while. I understand 3rd party apps like Instagram might not be as well optimized but surprised the stock camera performs this way.
Things I tried so far 
Scheduled reboots once a week
Used the labs feature in game booster
Device cleaner and optimization every couple of days
Switched to FHD resolution
Any ideas and tips to make this better are appreciated. I really want to like this phone, Why Samsung had to make it so hard."	R

Unlocked S22 Ultra 5g issues.	"Just upgraded to an unlocked Galaxy S22 Ultra directly from Samsung.  My old phone was the Galaxy S20 plus from Verizon. I got the phone 2 days ago, followed the activation steps, installed the sim card from my S20 plus into the S22 Ultra, and everything seems to be working great.  However no matter where I go, I never see the phone switch to 5g.  It's always on 4G LTE.  There is no option to switch to 5g under mobile networks.  There are only 3 options when I select it, data roaming access (which is selected), access point names, and network operators.  I've called VZ tech support and they had me reset the network connections, and still 4g LTE.  Not sure what my next step should be.  I understand that there is a battery issue with 5g, but I would still like the option to switch to it.  Any help is appreciated.  Thanks.
Edit: I live just north of Boston.  I checked the 5g coverage map and it is everywhere where I live, where I work, and all the surrounding towns.  5G worked perfectly fine at my house with my S20 plus and everywhere I went before.  Now same sim card, same plan as before that had 5g, and no 5G anywhere I go."	R
Gmail notifying only when phone turned on	"Sorry if this is a pure Android question, but this worked fine on my phones before getting my S22 recently:
I'm only getting Gmail notifications when I turn on the phone.  I've changed the app's battery setting to ""Unrestricted"", cleared the data and cache.  I don't think I've had a problem like this until now.
I need to get Gmail inbox notifications anytime, on or off.
Edit:  I don't mean actually powering the phone completely off.  I just mean switching the screen off with the button.  I'm not using any lock screen while at home, fwiw.  It may not be just Gmail notifications behaving like this.  I checked my Wi-fi settings for behavior during sleep, but I don't see an option for that."	R

Equalizer / Sound issues with one device	"Hi! I'm a new Samsung convert from Pixel. I just got the S22 Ultra and love it, but I'm having one big issue. I coach martial arts in the evenings, and during my class I control the music on the schools sound system. When I connected to the system yesterday, the music was incredibly loud. Like, I thought I was going to blow the speakers. This was on the absolute lowest volume setting I could get to. 
I tried turning Spotify on Quiet mode, creating a custom EQ with every preset down, and only playing softer music. It was okay, but still far too loud for my taste while trying to coach. Every other coach in the gym has an iphone and they never experience this issue.
Any recommendations how to more finely control the sound? I'm trying Wavelet after seeing some recommendations online, but I want a couple options if possible!"	R

Unable to disable Samsung notifications on S22	"I haven't used a Samsung in ages but came from Pixel life (the Nexus lines, OG Pixel, Pixel 3, Pixel 4a) because of the Google Fi deal and wanting a better camera.
I've taken the time to replace a majority of the Samsung apps with Google equivalents but am for some reason unable to figure out how to disable Samsung notifications. I created/removed Samsung account in order to see if that would reduce notifications. 
I feel like every day or every other day, I get promoted to: set up Samsung account, set up One Drive, link the two, etc.
Anyway to stop Samsung related notifications? When I go to app notifications, the ability to disable notifications for Samsung apps (especially Samsung Cloud which I think is the main culprit) is disabled. Google search tells me it's possible but following instructions online leadse to the same settings that aren't an option. Wondering if this changes with the S22."	R

Galaxy S22 Display Problem	"I apologize for my bad English, but I’m having problems with the S22 Display.
The main problems are 2, one occurs when using the ""Sensor Off"" setting where going to use the update of the display ""adaptive"" at times when it switches from 120hz to 24hz the display takes a green tint, disabling ""Sensor Off"" this problem is solved.  
Photo 120Hz : [https://imgur.com/a/xcl1FgZ](https://imgur.com/a/xcl1FgZ)  
Photo 24Hz : [https://imgur.com/a/c1tKUlS](https://imgur.com/a/c1tKUlS)
The second problem is as if the display had a very bad contrast calibration, the change of colour, especially in greys, tends to create a horrendous effect, the change from one colour to another takes place in a way and not in a homogeneous way.  
Photo : [https://imgur.com/a/u0SI9Xc](https://imgur.com/a/u0SI9Xc)
I’ll have to change the display, won’t I? I don’t think it’s a software problem. It seems right for a month-old device to have a similar problem.
Formatting and reinstalling Fw was for nothing.. the problem remains.

Terrible fingerprint scanner	"So I had upgraded to a s22+ from a s20+ hoping to have a better experience with the fp scanner. Because the scanner on the s20 was just garbage.
Initially I had gotten a s22+ but returned it due to Samsung coming out with a better deal for the trade-in.so I purchased the s22+ again from samsung.
I had firsts22+ for a few days and all was good.
However the second s22+ that I now have had a shitty fp scanner it seems. I get way too many unlock faikires and finger read errors. I had no such issues with the first s22+.
I'm just wondering if the fp scanner I got in this phone is just not the same build quality etc... 
I have erased and added fingers in all kinds of ways. I'm. It new to the fp scanners so I know all the tricks.
I'm just so fed up with having to deal with these issues with Samsung phones.

Photos deleted	So some how I ended up removing my wifes phone from Google family acct and it ended up factory resetting her phone.

Issue after may update	Back to the Members community lol. After the may update my s22 ultra seems to have worse battery life. It randomly loses battery like noticably on standby which it shouldn't.

Had like 4.5 hours of screen on time at beginning of my when the update came out and now it's going down. I saw others seemed to have some issues too with battery. I'm on 5g as well. I wasn't using it too crazily. I browsed the internet and I usually don't leave a bunch of apps running and I close them, tools some photos, texted a bit, used Bluetooth on my way to work to listen to music and back home, used Bluetooth to connect to galaxy watch.

S22U"	R
Software update broke outlook/teams	I recently bought S22 and couple weekends ago ran a software update. Next day Outlook and teams stopped working and I have reinstalled apps, restarted phone a few times with no change. Does anyone have similar issue or knows what's going on.	R
Phone suddenly overheating	"My base S22 started overheating today. I have no idea why. I haven't been doing anything that I think is particularly resource intensive. Some spotify, checking email, and texting. The top half of my phone is super hot. I turned it off and let it cool down. I just turned it on again and literally as soon as it boots up the top of my phone is super hot again.
&amp;#x200B;
Does anyone know a possible cause/fix for this? My phone hasn't done this until today. I'm starting to become really disappointed with this phone between its battery life and now this new overheating issue."	R
Data Issue	I recently I picked up an S10e. It was eBay refurbished in excellent condition and unlocked. It was the Cardinal Red, 128GB model. Anyway, I knew 5G SIMs are backwards compatible with 4G models so I took my secondary SIM (backup #) out of my S22 Ultra and put it into my S10e. Unfortunately even though I could make and receive calls and texts I wasn't able to use my voice-mail or use any of my apps with data. I'm on an AT&amp;T unlimited plan. So I took it out of my S10e and put it back into my S22 Ultra. Now none of my apps work with data in my S22 Ultra whether 5G or 4G except for the phone and messaging app(s). What do you all think? I tried removing my SIM card from it and resetting my S22 Ultra and putting it back in and backing up my settings there, but this issue persists. Unless someone has some advice I plan on going to our local AT&amp;T tomorrow to get this issue resolved. Worse comes to worse I'll need either get a new SIM with my backup # or have to pay a fee and get it canceled. Please thoughts?	R
not sure if it's the phone or car.	So, I've got a 2015 ford focus and I'm having an issue with connecting to the SYNC Bluetooth feature. It's telling me I'm connected for calls but not for audio, and when I turn the audio toggle back on it will turn on for a few seconds and turn itself back off. Anyone else have this issue and been able to fix it? TIA!	R
Phone Issues	I dont even have a month, with my s22 ultra. It has already crashed my apps and also bluetooth not connecting. Example, i had it connected to my car and the audio was coming out of my phone, same thing happened with my galaxy buds, like what in the world Samsung, I left you over 8 years ago and the same things continues to happen. Apps crashing, phone laggy, and so much more, yes you have limiteless customization, however, at the cost of having your phone exposed with viruses malware, which I dont have since I check for that on a regular basis with Samsung, but still gettting all these issues. Never had I ever had an issue with my iPhone, cant wait for the 14 to come out to GLADLY! Trade in this piece of garbage, nothing but issues, its their normal I should've known better, I will not to switch to you again this is my last time as a consumer for you.	R
S22 ultra poor reception	Wish I would have never upgraded from the S20 ultra. This is an almost useless brick. If Samsung doesn't get a fix for it soon I guess I will be switching to IPhone. I've did every trick my customer service says and everyone I've searched on the internet. I have missed many calls and texts due to this. For some reason if I do not have service I never receive texts or voice-mails. I know this isn't a carrier problem because I have 3 other phones on my account and every one of them get 2 to 3 bars when I have none. I've read on here Samsung customer service is useless to complain to. So what are we supposed to do with a phone you rarely even use as a phone. I let my return period end because I figured they might put out a fix.	R
Anyone else having issues with s22 ultra	So I just wanted to post this to ask is anyone still having software stability issues with their s22 ultra. Like it's much smoother than launch back in march of this year but still I see stutters and hiccups as I navigate through UI at times not often but does happen. I have such a high standard as the phone is mad expensive plus the previous flagships being s21 ultra and note 20 ultra were so buttery smooth. I also made a post about the battery life being pretty bad as of may update. As of now it doesn't feel like 1200-1500 flagship. I understand Samsung is working on providing updates every month with fixes and that's awesome and appreciated but I at times found myself wanting my s21 ultra back but sadly they don't sell that anymore. I like this phone a lot except for the software stability and Battery life issues.	R
Messages deleted with new update	All of my recent text messages deleted with the new update. How can I get them back. I tried to restore but the latest back up was done after the update so it did not restore them.	R
Takes forever to update apps from play store	I recently bought S22 ultra and while I put my apps on update they sometimes take 4 5 hours to get updated not sure why is it happening. My firmware is all up to date	R
Alarm sound doesn't work in silent mode . There's no sound it just vibrates	No alarm sound while in silent mode . I cleared cache and turned off vibrate . It still vibrates.	R
Media volume	The media volume keeps turning down automatically we troubleshoot the problem but no help samsung tech support refers me to authorized samsung repair they said the phone is okay the problem is related to software issues and they advised me to wait for new software fixWe need help pleaseThank you	R
Camera Video Stops Working	Has anyone had any issues while starting to take video with the camera? This is on the S22 Ultra. Right after the recent update at times after you start recording the camera struggles and skips until moments later it shows camera failed and shuts off. It doesn't happen every time you use it which may signal this is a software bug going on. Want to see if anyone has experienced this as well?	R
Disappointed	I have been a samsung customer since vcr, flip phone years. And I've never been more disappointment more than I am now with my S22 Ultra. I've had more issues from apps locking onto the screens to not having good connection. I've changed out the Sims card. I have Verizon and I know the network is great. But even when I'm at home. I don't have good connection. Is this happening with anyone else?	R
S22 Always On does not work even when Always On is set.	I have an S22 and have set Always On Display to Show Always. When I lock the screen, the clock displays momentarily then disappears, leaving only the fingerprint reader and charging icon showing. I have tried everything I can think of including tweaking many other settings, and disabling and re-enabling, all to no avail. Anyone have any experience with this?	R
Ultra Issues	Does anyone know why the battery life is so bad, the phone stays warm, and the camera doesn't produce clear pictures? I haven't even had the phone a full two months and it won't last a charge all day and the pictures and videos are very, very blurry compared to my s20+.	R
New S22+ Text Conversation Issue	"***EDIT*** I just found this video explaining what I needed to do and by golly it worked! Here's a link to it; perhaps it will help someone like it did me!      
Hey folks, I just upgraded from an S8 Active to an S22+ today and wow is it fast and pretty ""techy"" compared to my four year old S8! 
Here's my issue: I used Smart Switch to transfer the ""stuff"" from the S8 to the new phone. Surprisingly...everything transferred over okay...or so I thought. When I opened up my texts, I could see the 15 or so conversations I had on my S8 were now on the S22+; so I'm thinking ""sweet!!!"" Unfortunately when I opened a few of those conversations, almost without exception, the only part of the conversation and any pics were what the other party sent me. NONE of ""my side"" of the conversation transferred over. I ran the text messages through Smart Switch again and it made no difference. I then called my local AT&T store and described my issue. The gal there told me to download the AT&T Mobile Transfer app on both phones, select the text messages-only like I did the second time with Smart Switch and see what happens. Welp...the same thing happened again, my side of the conversation is still missing. I had my wife text me and I replied to her. Now my ""new"" text responses to her ARE in the conversation but only her side of the conversation was shown prior to that. 
So am I missing something here or am I just doomed with this issue. Believe me, I'm thankful to have what I do have from all these folks with our conversations but it would be nice to see what I had to say and sent! 
And I did use the wireless wi-fi method to transfer the data. Perhaps Thursday night when I get home from work and have some time, I may try the cable method... 
Thanks in advance!"	R
Bixby routine issues?	Does anyone have issues with their routines? I have one set up to turn on my wifi when I get home and turn it off when I connect bluetooth to my truck but it doesn't turn off while I'm driving. I have to go into routines, enter the edit mode, tap next, and then it saves and turns it off. Kinda like the phone is saying "oh yeah, my bad". Sometimes I have to drive far enough away from work for it to turn off. It's just not consistent.	R

Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra Clear View Case issues.	Hey there peeps. Having display issues with my clear view case. Every single time I take the phone out of the case then put it back in the display doesn't show. I have to reboot the phone to get it working. It's very single time I take it out this happens. It's very frustrating. Any suggestions on a fix would be greatly appreciated.	R
Random freezes of the screen	"Hello everyone.
Does anyone else expirience random screen freezes which force you to reboot the phone to resume normal function? Whats wierd is that it only freezes the home screen and closed apps. I can use the pull down navigation bar and i can use gestures to switch between apps or go to home screen and the back button but as soon as something is opened in full screen, the screen becomes unresponsive? Ive been searching the internet for solutions but I am running into a dead end. 
So is anyone else having this problem aswell or is it just me? I tried factory resetting the phone and the problem persists.
Thank you for your help."	R
Moisture has been detected	"Anyone has this problem? Bought my 22 ultra on 5/5 and about a week later I got the dumb moisture detected in the usb charging port.
&amp;#x200B;
A good week passed and the stupid notification was still showing. I can only charge wirelessly. 
Fact is it was never near liquid or water. 
&amp;#x200B;
&amp;#x200B;
Called my carrier's insurance after a week and they claimed it was some malware. I was instructed to download ATT's shield app and run a scan. Long story short, moisture notification is still up.
&amp;#x200B;
Called my insurance and they told me to go to an ATT store for a fix or replacement. ATT told me after checking that my phone was never near water. Some white strip at the bottom of the charging port was still white-meaning water never touched it. They called Assurion and some back and forth the solution was to take it to a local ""fix it"" shop that was contracted with my insurance.
&amp;#x200B;
Took it to the ""fix it"" shop, they are saying the same thing too and it's still under Samsung warranty. 
An order for a new usb port was sent and I need to wait. 
&amp;#x200B;
My question is-anyone went through the same issues here? Moisture detected and it's not going away? Is there a fix?
&amp;#x200B;
Thanks!"	R
Glide typing problems	I've used glide typing for years, but since getting the S22, it's become ultra frustrating. It acts like I've lifted my finger mid word for what appears to me to be no reason. It seems to behave the same between the stock keyboard and Gboard. Anyone else have this issue? Any advice on settings I may have missed?	R

Help with Google Play System Update notification constantly showing up	Hey all, so around 9:30 every night when I am only connected to a mobile network I get a downloading notification for "Google Play System Update". As far as I have seen it only happens on mobile. It will be downloading, finish downloading, then look as if it immediately restarts and downloads again. I've let this cycle up to 5 times before just cancelling it. Sometimes it will start back up again but after cancelling again it will quit for the night. I tried manually doing the google play system update through the settings but it seems that hasn't changed anything. Any advice?	R
Proximity sensor fails when connected to GW4	Whenever I connect my S22+ to my Galaxy Watch 4 (i.e., almost all day long), the proximity sensor doesn't work (since last update). Any hints or workarounds? Thanks.	R

S22 ultra Wi-Fi not finding networks	Why is it that my wifi does not find the wifi networks around me. I've tried turning the phone off and on, turned the airplane mode on and off, factory reset the wifi on the phone. It still does not find wifi networks. Anyone else having this problem	R
Phone cannot hang up	I just bought an S22 Ultra. The old way of hanging up a call AFTER leaving the dialing keypad by swiping down from the top of the screen no longer works. I have been compelled to go into phone settings and to set the phone app to close with the side key. Otherwise, the phone app does NOT allow me to hang up the phone unless I can retrieve the phone app from RECENTS. Clicking on CLOSE ALL (apps) gets rid of the only other way to end the call UNLESS the side key is enabled to end calls. Talk about toll call charges... 😳	R
Trojan or bad firmware update?	I have noticed strange behavior with my S22 plus. It gets hot randomly. I have noticed this happens when I see "System UI" in the recent notifications menu but no notifications show up. I already tried a factory reset without having Google auto reinstall all applications. I have selectively installed apps after realizing I was having this problem. The last time this happened (about an hour ago), I again checked my notifications menu and it listed the last three programs as "Android systems", "systems UI" and "package installer". I also noticed that my phone will show the blinking light when my phone is on idle saying I have notifications and when I open my case and unlock my phone, I don't see anything. I check most recent notifications and it is always "system UI" and additional programs that I listed sometimes.I have noticed these problems in the last month or so after the latest April and May updates. I cannot pinpoint if this was the cause or just a coincidence in timing. My current security update is on version 5.10.43, OneUI version is 4.1.Is anyone else experiencing these issues? Did you notice this happening after the April or May security update? How can I scan for Trojans? I have Malwarebytes, eset security and Lookout. No detections.	R
Two of the same notifications	Hi guys. Is anyone experiencing having two of the same notifications? If you've solved it, can you please share how you did it?	R
S22 Ultra S Pen Calibration	I'm having an issue with my Galaxy S22 Ultra's S-Pen.To put it simply: My S22 S-Pen is not as precise or calibrated as my Note 9 S-Pen(I'll be referring to the S22 Ultra S-Pen as the "New S-pen" and the Note 9 S-pen as the "Old S-pen" to make it easier to follow along)I'm an digital artist, and I tend to do very precise lineart, so I know when my stylus is misbehaving. But even then, I only do sketch work on my phones and I can still feel this New S-Pen isn't as precise as my Old S-Pen. Sometimes, it's precise as can be, but there are times when it just messes up and gets slightly off from where I'm drawing/ writing.So I tested the Old S-Pen on my S22 Ultra (thankfully, it can be used on a newer phone), and I found that it was better calibratied and more precise than the s pen that came with my S22 Ultra. So I'm thankful that the issue is in the pen, and not the phone.The question I have now is if anyone else with the S22 Ultra S-Pen is experiencing this issue?Should I simply buy myself a new S22 Ultra S-Pen?OrShould I buy an Older Model S-pen that I can house in my new phone?This could be easily fixed if the phone had a Calibration option...but it doesnt.

S 22 Ultra Night mode camera	Hi everyone. I'm getting issues when using night mode camera. Once the picture is processed there are dots/ pixels all over the picture. Please note it only happens when using night :crescent_moon: shot. My phone is updated, tried restarting phone, reseting camera but nothing worked. Also when using Expert Raw there were no dots or anything like that.	R
disappointed with my s22 ultra	Sadly, this post is my goodbye from Samsung phones, it is not a pity complaint nor am i trying to get someone to feel sorry for me, it is a statement. I started to notice these small details when i owned a galaxy s21 ultra, which were poor battery life, and sluggish performance. these issues seem to have carried over to the s22 ultra, the most i have been able to squeeze out of the battery is 5.5 hours of screen time, which can translate to barely a days' worth. i accomplished this by using the steps provided by a user on xda forums, the guide is called: complete Samsung galaxy optimization guide. i had to resort to this guide because before the optimization i was only getting around 4.5 hours of screen time, before i needed a charge. i do not root my phones, nor run them at full throttle. Even after the optimization guide my phone is sluggish at times, either navigating through the ui, opening and closing apps, or even making phone calls. i am deeply disappointed, because it is one of the most expensive phones on the market, yes, in my opinion it has the best camera setup in a smartphone, and it has the best oled panel, but, it is not worth the price tag due to sluggish performance and short battery duration, even though it has a massive 5000 mAh. in my opinion Samsung is taking its loyal customers for granted, i include myself because i have owned a Samsung since the galaxy s3. No, I'm not switching to iPhone, a brand that is overhyped and overpriced. I'm just gonna look to an android alternative, whichever it may be. I hope someone from Samsung that can make a difference reads this, hopefully in the near future, Samsung will value its customers like it once did years ago, and release a better product, in going to include the galaxy watch 4 classic on here as well, barely 2 days' worth of battery life, and still the same lame selection of watch faces, by now, samsung's watch face library should be huge, but it isn't, you have to download from another app, before anyone supports the mediocre battery life for the smart watch, do some research and look for battery life on old galaxy watches, they used to last at least a week on a single charge, yes the technology is changing and everything consumes more power, but Samsung didn't care to upgrade the battery size or the technology to give customers its best product.	R
Battery performance and software updates	I've noticed my s21 has a better battery performance than my newly owned s22 ultra. I just got my s22 and only one update, May update. I observed that the s22 has two updates, any help?	R
My storage keeps filling up	So i got the new S22 and almost instantly noticed that my storage is slowly but consistenly filling. I tried deleting apps. Checked the android folder. No matter what i tried the "Other Storage" is filling. For a few days it went up by 0.5 GB. With that rate I'm gonna need a new phone very soon. Not even month and it's 2 GB up. I have maybe 5 apps I use and I have deleted everything that i don't need. No weater app, no samsung gear. Only facebook, messenger, instagram, clash of clans and a few banking app.   	R
Samsung S22 ultra battery issue	I am grossly disappointed in my Samsung S22 ultra. I had an S20 with a pretty decent battery life up until about a month ago. Therefore, I went ahead and spent the money on a new phone. The battery is absolutely horrible. I did batter optimization, closed apps, deleted apps, etc. with no improvement. I chatted with Samsung customer service who suggested I return it and order a new one - which I did - but still have the same problem. This is a lot of money to be spent to not have a decent battery life. I even chatted with four to five customer service representatives when I asked if I could have my Samsung S20 returned back to me. No one can tell me anything. I keep getting passed around and numbers to call. As much as I despise apple and Iphone, my husband's Iphone 13 battery lasts forever. Samsung, you have to do better and you should also reimburse your customers in some manner and/or fix this battery problem with the Samsung S 22. I have used Samsung phones for years.. Now I am debating if I ever will go back. Deeply disappointed.	R

what's app proximity sensor not working	"When I wanna hear a voice message the display doesn't turn off and due to the touch of my ear or cheek I navigate through the phone. I tested the proximity sensor while phoning and via the Samsung members app test function - both works. So it's only WhatsApp with this problem.
Anyone else faces this issue and know a solution?
Thanks"	R
Voice to text issue.. Adding words	"When I use voice to text more often then not the word ""is"" will be added to whatever I am dictating. I often experience this issue on other samsung devices as well, again all with the word ""is"" being added.

S22U S Pen Issue	When I remove the S Pen its housing while the screen is off the pen does not register on the screen even though the phone shows it is connected and the air gestures work fine. If the screen is already on and I remove the pen everything works as it should. Any ideas of how to fix this? I've tried rebooting the phone and resetting the pen and no luck.	R
Stuttering during video streaming	I have the base S22 and notice random stuttering during video streams when 120hz is enabled. When I disable it, the stuttering completely disappears. Is anyone else having the same issue? Is there a fix for this yet? Thanks.	R

anyone lose text messages?	"I am on verizon with a s22 ultra. I was having problems sending group mms text.   Everything else is fine,  I called up Verizon,  they had me troubleshooting they had me shut off phone and  take out the Sim card and then insert it again. After I did that and restarted the phone half of my text messages are gone.  I had many threads but some of them showed the last I had a conversation was weeks ago.   I asked tech support and he said he never heard of that and does not know a way to get them back.  It not the end of the world but definitely annoying.  Has anyone seen this what would cause it?
EDIT: well good news, i was able to restore my text messages by using a much older samsung s8, I charged it up, was already factory reset, then logged in with my gmail account, and luckily my google account was backing up my SMS, and last backed it up 10 AM today. So now I Have all my old text messages on my s8. I just need to find a way to bring it over back to my s22. I think i might be able to do that with smart switch not sure."	R
Why S22 Ultra speakers sounds cheap compare to iPhones?	Bought s22 ultra at 1L+ INR pricesI feel two major downgrades1) Battery life2) Speaker sound qualityBattery drains faster and not longer than last year's s21+ which is strange!Speaker output also feels like cheap phones, if you are charging premium atleast give premium sound experience.

S22 after many weeks. Heating, battery, performance.	"I've had the phone for many weeks now. The battery got better, but the heating and thus the performance was awful. 
For anyone having these problems: factory reset the phone and DON'T use any apps like smart switch, just install by hand, it doesn't take much time and it's worth it.
This time I didn't put any apps to sleep, still using 120hz, and didn't try anything else to make the battery better (when I got the phone I heard it's not the best so I tried instantly everything to make it better)
Now instead the 4.5-5 hour SOT with 9gag, reddit and mainly games (Diablo Immortal, Ulala, etc.)
I get 6+ SOT.
Also since the reset the phones temperature is much better. Its not overheating from simple tasks like camera, and smaller games."	R

S22+ charging issues	" Hi all,
I own an S22 Plus and recently noted the following:
* When charging the mobile using a Fast Adaptive Charger (18w) and using a USB A to USB-C cable, charging starts, stops after a couple of seconds, then starts charging again after about 2 minutes.
* When using a 25W USB-C charger Super Fast Charging commences without any issues.
I noticed this recently.  What could be the issue and how can I solve this?
Thanks"	R

camera help	So I just upgraded to the s22 ultra and when I use different apps that use the camera for video chatting it seems to only use a camera that doesn't focus and is stuck with a far focus but if I use the camera normally that issue isn't there the auto focus works perfectly. I was wondering if there's a setting I missed or something that can fix this or am I just SOL	R
Audio issues with WhatsApp	Hi guys. My S22 cuts off audio when I call on WhatsApp, so I have to restart the phone to get my sounds back. I use USB c adapter for my headphones. Could this be the issue? I did not experience such problems with my first S22.	R
Camera app weird behaving	Everytime I open or close the camera app I can hear a strange click sound(It might be the vibration motor but I'm not sure. Navigation haptics are disabled). It also happens while switching the camera modes(portrait, video, night etc.). Another thing is the "noise" sound while using camera. I have put the phone next to my ear and I could hear a continous noise sound. Is that normal or there is something wrong with my exact model? All these things are only appearing in the camera app. I also tried muting all the sounds, system, ringtone, media and nothing changed.	R
Screen won't stay off during call	If I am holding the phone so that it's between my ear and shoulder, I'm having to press the side key several times to keep the screen off. Sometimes even when holding the phone normally, the screen won't stay off. Calls get placed on hold or buttons get pressed; very irritating.	R
USB-C port is already dodgy	I bought an S22 Ultra two months ago and already I have to wiggle a charging cable or aux adapter to get it to register. It's extra ridiculous because I almost never use the port - almost always I charge wirelessly. Rest of the phone is great but Samsung's build quality has disappointed me again.	R
Alarm issue. NO SOUND	NO SOUND DURING ALARM. Just vibrates. Tried clearing all the cache and turning off the vibration for ringtones and alarm. Still the same.And, NO my phone is not on Silent mode. New S22 ultra dissapoints. Missed my meeting at work this morning. That's how i figured out.Other buletooth and connectivity issues, but that's for another post. Need help for the alarm, as I have a hetic week ahead.	R
Camera Shutter / moving subjects	So I thought that after the second may update everyone said the camera shutter lag was gone. Went with my S22U instead of the iPhone and I'm still getting blurry images. Is there no way to avoid this issue?	R
Phone galaxy s 22 ultra	I have the new samsung galaxy s 22 ultra but I have this problem it does not charge in my car and everything is original the cable the head I also bought a 45 w charger and everything is the same samsung they do not give me a concrete answer pure evasion I would like to know if someone else has this issue	R

Swiftkey is horrible in new S22+	So coming from the Galaxy 6 ... had been using the Swipe (or whatever it was called on that phone) for 6 years. This version of SwiftKey on the S22+ is horrible. I used to be able to swipe with minimal incorrect entries. However NOW, I get so many missed entries that it makes swiping almost useless.Is there a better more useful Swiping option?	R
S22 UltraVirbation	My S22 Ultra does not vibrate for text messages and messenger. The intensity has been set to high.. I have called T mobile, they have reset my phone 2x and nothing changed. I was informed to contact Samsung for help	R
Portrait mode doesn't work on s22 ultra	When I go into camera portrait mode, apply an effect like blur or black and white etc. I take the pic and it doesn't apply the effect I chose to the photo. I've reset the camera app and cleared the cache and data. How do I fix this issue on my s22 ultra ? I've enclosed pics to better illustrate what I'm talking about.	R
Bluetooth automatically switches to phone from car with audio books when car off	Listen to audio books playing on phone in car Bluetooth connection. When I turn off car, book starts playing from phone automatically. Don't want that	R
s22 ultra isn't recognized on any computers	Today I went to plug my s22+ ultra into my PC for large file transfer, and after 2 hours of fidgeting, I could not figure out the issue. Do you have any suggestions before i do a final hard reset?What I've done so far: Made sure cord is not the problem, and PC is not the problem as my wife's S22+ ultra connects via the same cord to my PC and functions properly.I have gone as far as to enable developer settings in order to default the USB connection to file transfer, but to no avail. No matter which cord or port or computer I connect my S22+ ultra to, it is treated like a charging cable and the computer doesn't even acknowledge the connections.	R
S22 not recognize USB drive	It is not showing up usb drive I noticed now	R
Samsung S22 ultra	After reading comments in this thread I wanted to share that I too, since having my S22 ULTRA am not able to post music to my fb stories without the screen going black. It does not happen on my other device and only with this app. I am also noticing that the stories do not stream. Going between facebook and instagram is no longer seamless on this device. There is definitely a glitch that is on Samsungs side and it is frustrating to say the least.	R
WIFI Connectivity Issues	Guys,I need help, many times, I bought S22+ and notice that it has a terrible wifi performance. Lots of time, the wifi doesn't switch automatically to available wifi, i notice it has very short range to pick up signal and compared with my realme x2 pro, it often gets disconnected to wifi too. I did already reset everything even to factory default but still the same. I'm so really disappointed. I'm not getting response from Samsung about this issue.	R
I'm having trouble getting my OTP's all of a sudden for some reason...	+	R
Choppy/No video playback	When I am scrolling thru videos on apps like TikTok or Instagram, I am continually running into issues like choppy video/audio, only audio, very delayed playback or it just won't load. This is not an issue with other devices on my WiFi network, they even play the same videos with no issues.Is this a settings issue or something else?Thank you.	R

No Notification Sound	I have a new S22 Ultra. Notification sounds have just disappeared. I originally set up notifications with both sound and vibrate. Now there is no sound and I cannot figure out why. When I am on the Notification sound page, tapping on any of the sound choices the phone only vibrates and doesn't play the sound.All volumes are on, do not disturb is off. I've done everything short of a factory reset. It is very frustrating!I was on the phone with Samsung for over 2 hours and they couldn't fix it. Their resolution was to mail back my phone to get a refund and purchase a new one! You've got to be kidding me!I'm stuck ... any other suggestions or ideas on what to check?	R
No names only numbers in group texts	HELP! When receiving group texts from co workers, even though I have all of them saved in my contacts, the group texts only show phone numbers. I have no idea who is sending the text messages.	R
Crackling Speakers?	Hello everyone, I'm new on the boards and wanted some help, because I'm not understanding this.So I upgraded my phone to the newest Galaxy S22 (standard) from my Galaxy S20 fe, I've been with Samsung for almost ten years as a customer, and I'm experiencing crackling audio? It happens randomly, a restart doesn't fix it either. I'm being told that this is a widespread hardware issue? I don't want to leave the brand, but this is has me stuck. Any ideas? Is this a software or hardware issue?	R
Sideways picture texts	When I send portrait pictures as a text, they are sent and received sideways. I have turned off the auto rotation screen and that did not fix it.	R
Tagging on Facebook App / Web Browser	Since the S21, what has been up with being able to tag people using the Facebook App? I use the S22 Ultra and the issue still exist. It shows blue and the user will be tagged in a post that you write , but once you post it, the name is regular text and user never gets notified.I am not referring to tagging a person in a picture. I am writing a post and want to @SAMSUNG and it displays blue and then nothing. This happens on the web browser (Chrome / Firefox) and when I view as desktop on my device.I log into my account on an iPhone 12 and no issues with tagging a friend or user on a post.	R
Night mode	I just noticed that when doing night mode shot. For it to fully take effect, after taking a shot, you need to zoom in first on the picture for you to see the night mode effect. Otherwise itll be just a low light ordinary shot	R
Photo changes after taking it s22 ultra	Hello, I'm having a very strange issue with my photos on the s22 ultra. Sometimes, when I take a photo, it will look normal, even show the same photo in the gallery icon but then soon change to something that happened soon after the photo was taken. For example I took a picture of a kitten, and shortly after the photo the kitten meowed. I showed the photo to my girlfriend, gallery icon looked normal, and then my girlfriend asked me to send her the photo, when I went to send it, the photo changed to a picture of the kitten meowing! Again, I took the photo before the kitten meowed and even showed this photo to my girlfriend, then it changed!I tried finding a setting but couldn't find anything. I tried googling but could only find this thread that I think may actually be related https://us.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-S22/Photos-turn-blurry-immediately-after-taking-them/td-p.... I followed the steps in that including resetting and clearing cache and I was able to eventually recreate the problem, so what is going on here?	R
S22 ultra dropping calls after turning off wifi calling	Hey All,So I just recently upgraded from an S9 to a S22 Ultra and have noticed over the last couple of days that if I use wifi calling and then turn it off to use mobile network, even with full bars, my phone will drop calls before they even have a chance to connect.I thought it might be an update issue but after making sure my phone is up to date it still does this. Does anyone have any information on this and any possible solutions?Thanks	R
Better camera apps? White balance way off in auto	"Just wondering if there are better camera apps than the stock samsung one.  I never noticed before until i took some pictures of some 3d prints i did.  The first pic is auto.  the 2nd pic is with playing around with some settings in Pro.  mainly the white balance.  The green is much truer in pro with adjusting the white balance.  The green to the naked eye is really bright green 
I would rather just take the camera out and use auto and get true color representation.    "	R
Notification Reminder With Different Sound Missing On S22?	I recently upgraded to S22+ from S20. I used Notification Reminder for many years where I could set Notification Reminder with different sound other than the Default notification sound. That was how I could distinguish a Reminder sound from a new Notification sound. I loved such feature. However, I could not set it on my S22+. I wonder such feature no longer avail or am I missing something? Any help would be greatly appreciated.	R
Visual Voicemail	Is anyone have issues with their visual voicemail not working on the s22 ultra ? Every time I get a voicemail it goes to the regular at&t voicemail . I tried going into the app to set it up ,but I keep getting error messages. I'm posting two pictures to show the messages. I googlesd and apparently it's a known issue on the s 22, but I haven't ran across a solution yet.	R
SD S22U Jittery refresh rate and inconsistent performance	"So I've been using my S22U for 2 months now, coming from a galaxy A30. Never owned a flagship before and so i was super hyped for the 22U with camera &amp; display being the most important to me, which i definitely knew samsung would deliver. The phone has generally been great but the inconsistencies make it not so great at times. 
As the title says the refresh rate feels not so smooth even at 120Hz and at 60Hz it feels terrible, worse than the 60Hz on my A30 lol. The 120 definitely is very noticeably smoother than 60 duh but anytime i scroll, the screen moves pretty quickly and doesn't feel like its as smooth as it should be. For comparison, i put it against my moms S21 FE at both 120Hz &amp; 60Hz and it felt smoother especially if i moved my finger slowly. Scrolling also resulted in the screen moving a bit slowly and looked smoother. Even the 60Hz felt less laggy. 
But turning on refresh rate shows its 120Hz. So is the cpu/gpu causing the lag then? 
As for performance, its inconsistent. I don't game but at times the phone feels slower than how you'd expect a flagship to perform. It also heats up pretty quickly and while it is around +30⁰ where i live other phones don't heat up this quickly and usually happens when im using the camera. Ik ppl don't like benchmarks (i was worried i had a bad unit maybe) but I've been trying out 3D mark here n there over these months to keep check on how my phone performs and my results on wildlife have varied from 5000-9800. At times the temp is around 30⁰ but the fps still drops like nuts so i dont get if its simply a heating issue or smth wrong with the gpu/cpu. 
Tl;dr - S22U 60Hz super choppy 120Hz not as smooth as S21FE 120Hz. Heats up fast and feels a bit slow here n there"	R

Auto Brightness Issue	"The Auto Brightness is totally broken on my S22 Ultra. In not much bright indoor conditions the Brightness always gets too much (around 80%) just like it gets in very bright outdoors. The Auto Brightness works fine in dark conditions/night though.
Anyone else facing this?"	R
For those of you with broken camera lenses: iPhone 13 lenses fit the S22 Ultra.	"Please don't take this as a definite fix, but for those of you with unfortunate broken lens mirrors on your S22 Ultras, I recently met someone who broke theirs, and the repair shop where he took his phone did not offer S22 Ultra replacement lenses. They did however, offer the possibility of using an iphone 13 replace lense mirror and see if it fit. 
It ended up fitting just fine, albeit less protruding than the original lenses, but it clicked into place and he has been using his phone and camera with absolutely no issues for more than a month since the replacement. 
Just putting this out there for people who can't send their phones in for repairs to Samsung. iPhone replacement lenses should be easier to find and they should do the trick."	R
Getting this on restart....ideas?		R
Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra not registered on network error.	My S22 ultra was purchased directly from Samsung and i have been using it as my daily with an ATT sim. I recently took it in for an insurance claim repair (cracked screen) through Asurion and got the phone back the same day. After getting home, When i inserted the sim card back in the phone at the top right there was a 🚫 where the signal usually is. I cannot make calls and or use any mobile data. I have tried everything on i could find online and on here and nothing seems to work. And the phone has the most up to date software. I will be going to a ATT store to see if the sim card is the issue however my current sim works perfect on my iPhone and was previously in use inside the S22 Ultra. Any suggestions? Could it be the device itself?	R
Anybody having issues with android auto?	I love the s22 ultra, haven't had any of the issues people complain about. I'll spare everyone the moon picture haha. I've got a 2021 charger that android auto suddenly stopped working on. Same with my wife's 2020 forester. Is the fix to downgrade the app and turn off auto updates? Any other suggestions? I've tried uninstalling, repairing with the car, new cable etc. Seems odd it worked fine for months when it was brand new but a recent update to android auto seems to have broke it. Thanks!	R
[HOW TO] Stop any system app from bypassing doze, and restrict their battery	"Have you ever dreamed of putting this damn \[Insert system app name here\] that drains your battery to sleep mode? Well it is possible
**Please note that I haven't extensively tested this, I am not responsible for anything that it causes to your phone, remove apps from the doze whitelist at your own risk**
* Connect your phone to your PC using ADB
* Type **adb shell dumpsys deviceidle** and scroll up
* You will see a list of applications, you are looking for the ones under **Whitelist system apps**, note the apps that you want to remove the bypass, for example, **com.facebook.services**
* Type the command **adb shell dumpsys deviceidle sys-whitelist -com.facebook.services** to remove the app from the whitelist
* Now, type **adb shell dumpsys deviceidle** and scroll up again, the application should now be under **Removed from whitelist system apps**
* Head to your phone and go into **Apps**, look for the application and click on it, click on **Battery** and you will notice that all options are now ungrayed, enjoy
Other notes:
* To cancel your changes, replace the minus sign with a plus, example: **adb shell dumpsys deviceidle sys-whitelist +com.facebook.services**
* The apps that are not listed under **System** in **Apps** should also show up in **Background usage limits &gt; Sleeping apps / Deep sleeping apps**
* I am pretty sure sleeping some apps that weren't meant to be put into sleep might cause more drain that it might save, so please make sure that the apps you put into sleep don't cause any issues"	R

3 hours with s22	So I purchased s22 around 2 weeks ago and I'm getting like 3 hours on screen time. That's all to it.	R
Oversharpening	On S22+ front camera, the photos taken using normal Photo and Portrait mode really looks oversharpened. Is it maybe just the screen, because of the display that I can clearly see every detail of the photo, or the camera post processing really oversharpens after the shot? Or is it only me, lol.	R
Strange lock screen bug.	Has anyone encountered an issue where when they wake the phone from sleep the lock screen clock still displays some old time before the current time quickly flashes on?	R
S22 Plus Owners who swipe to text, how often does it fail?	"Something I noticed whether or not I turn on touch sensitivity... Texting always frustrates me on this phone when swiping. At least ten times a day or more, it won't work as intended. For instance I'll swipe the word fabulous, and halfway through the word it gets broken up into fab lots. Or I'll swipe the word YouTube, but it breaks up into the words you tube.
It's frustrating to me. Tried Google Gboard, tried Samsung. Tried Touch Sensitivity turned on. I use the Ailun glass screen protector off Amazon. My hands are clean, screen is clean. Just waiting this, it happened when trying to type sensitivity. (Also waiting instead of working, er worrying, geesus! Its writing! lol. Just writing this annoys the piss out of me. You get what I'm saying?)
Is this normal? It's like the swipe is broken, or touch sensitivity is too damn high or could be too low. Almost like the same issue I had with the S20 FE."	R
Insta Lag	"Guys I am aware that I am not supposed to post it here, bt I really don't hv anywhere else to ask this question

Sound quality	Hey everyone, I've been a lifelong iPhone user and I just switched to the s22 ultra. The sound quality sounds staticy when I'm connected to any other speaker like my car and my jbl speaker but not my galaxy buds. Is there a way I can fix this because on my old iPhone it sounded so clear when I played anything in my car and speaker.	R
Problems i notice with the s22 series	●Screen burn in has been worse or has gotten worse with have 120hz refresh rate on compated to the standard 60hz●Phone seems to lag more often than usually●Some pixels dont turn on fast enough when screen is turned on.Thats all the problems i had with my s22+ so far.	R
Bugs	Why is that there's so bugs on my phone some of my apps are not working like edge lighting . And too much for this phone .	R
Crackling speakers	The issue with crackling speakers after pressure and temperature changes is now quite well known. I too have had this issue since Day 1 of getting the phone and it seems it is clearly a flaw in the design. It's very annoying and embarrassing to be using a flagship phone that has this kind of a problemSamsung - what are you doing to fix this flaw in the phone or are you claiming it is a feature? You need to either release a fix or replace the phones affected with a new version that does not have this problem!	R
Missing Messages in Google Messaging App (but showing in Samsung Messaging)	"I recently got a new S22+ and used the built-in data transfer to get all my stuff from my previous S8 Active. 
With the S22+ having Google Messaging as the default app, I was browsing through it to make sure that all of my data carried over. After a bit of digging (it wasn't immediately apparent), I noticed some messages with another person that only showed their sent messages but none of my replies. I opened up the Samsung Messaging app and I can see all of my sent messages. 
I'd like to use the Google Messaging app for various reasons, but don't want to use it if it's missing messages. Has anyone run into this and/or have a suggestion on how to get the messages to show in both apps?"	R

problems with freezing?	Has anyone has any trouble with the ultra freezing up and restarting? Mine has been doing it more so when I plug it up to my car/ Android auto. It's done it's probably 8- 9x over the last week or two I've had it. I've already cleared cache partition, and this was the first restart since that. I can wait if it's just a software thing they can patch but it just is annoying to have to gamble whether it'll freeze everytime I want to drive somewhere.	R
Does "Accidental touch protection" work?	"In my phone ""Accidental touch protection"" is on. But, my phone always wakes up in my pocket. It registers fingerprint on the sensor area in my pocket. Sometimes when i forgot to lock the phone, it accidentally sends pictures on the messenger or do some other things. 
Also, when any call came in my pocket, it accidentally sends messeges to that number rejecting that call. I mean when call came it lights up in the pocket which should not be like that. 
My previous phone was oneplus 9 pro, in that phone  when any call came inside the pocket the phone just rang with screen lights off. 
How to solve the issue?"	R
Anyway to back up data with android recovery mode?	My s22 ultra is rebooting constantly with only 1-30 seconds of use before it freezes and reboots again. I essentially have no way of backing up my data. Just wondering if there's any way I can do that without the actual use of my phone since sending it in to samsung for repair requires factory reset.

Home Screen nonresponsive on S22 Ultra	"Out of the blue today, my touchscreen has started to become non-responsive. Sliding down the notification tray and interacting with notifications works, as does using the side-menu, which even allows me to open apps that I've docked there. But any presses on the screen itself (outside of those menus) isn't registered. My swipe gestures (for home, recent apps, and back) also seem to work just fine. Further, I can use my pattern-password to unlock the phone as well, the touches just stop working when I hit the home screen.
Restarting the phone fixed the issue for a few hours, but it's already back (I guess this indicates a software issue). Is anyone else experiencing something like this?
Thanks for any help/clarification!"	R
Car Bluetooth	"Hello, I was wondering if anyone was having the following issue when connecting to a car's Bluetooth system: The artist and song title don't show up and only displays track and has the pause/play button.

I have a galaxy S8 that worked and after checking it again it shows both the title and the song unlike the S22. Any suggestions are appreciated."	R

Also I don't get any notifications shown. They come through but nothing shows in the bar. I've tried clearing cache and force stopping One UI but didn't help.

S22 Ultra eSIM problem	The last day, my s22 ultra is constantly switching between the primary line and eSIM every few seconds, and it's very frustrating my phone is not operating normal, and it's overheating because of it	R
S22 Ultra network drop	First s22 ultra i received kept dropping network constantly. Reached out to Samsung and they sent me a replacement phone. The replacement phone is now doing the same. It is not the carrier since I spent 2 hours on the phone with the carrier to resolve this.I commute same route daily and none of my other samsung phones never dropped network connection. with this phone, both of them now, is dropping connection after 5 mins. this phone will NOT auto connect to network as i move around and I find myself constantly resetting the network from 5g to 4g to get data.Samsung, your network mode do not auto connect. They simply stay locked to your zone and once you move out of the area, it disconnects from the network. Please fix this or this phone is coming back to you as well.Your support team? is a joke. please teach them what e-sims are and how to manage them properly. They want me to factory reset, which will remove the e-sim and has to load from the carrier again. Why did I go to e-sim? because network was dropping like crazy and they all asked me to reinsert the sim. (both t-mobil and samsung)I am more than frustrated when my data won't connect and sometimes my conversations drops as well. This is so frustrating.... S21, z flip 3 are the most recent phones I used and never had this issue!	R
Google phone app / Call Background	The call background option doesn't seem to be working in the Google phone app. I've tried setting it using my own photos and also using the stock photos, but I don't see the background I've set it using any photos.

SOT on wifi vs. mobile data	Just to be clear, I get around 7-8 hours SOT when I run on wifi from 100 to 20%, and just 2-3 hours on purely mobile data from 100 to 20%. I'm assuming this is also the case for all owners that post wide variations of SOT data. But every time I see posts of SOT, I'm kind of questioning my device if the battery is faulty or not. Is the result same as yours or am I wrong and my battery is faulty?	R
[Help] Issue with the front-facing camera	"This might be the wrong place to ask. If so, feel free to inform me.
Last night I had my phone sitting on a table next to me which my cat promptly pushed off onto our wooden floor. My phone landed face down on the screen protector but is visually flawless, aside from a couple of micro-scratches on the protector. I thought all was fine until I noticed that every other time I turn my screen on there was a quiet buzzing/vibration coming from the upper portion of the screen, and the noise would cease after my phone was unlocked. I use facial recognition and, after some critical thinking, opened my camera app and switched it to selfie mode. Almost immediately the buzzing started and I noticed it was struggling to focus on my face for a few seconds, but once it focused the buzzing stopped.
Other than this strange phenomenon with the camera, my phone functions perfectly fine (aside from pretty regular lag and stuttering that I'm told is normal and should be fixed in future updates). I'm curious if this is something others experience and, if so, is it worth opening a warranty claim? I always buy Samsung's flagships and want them to look and function like one.

Reduce CPU performance without power saving	Having the phone in power saving mode I find the CPU to be more than capable. But when in power saving mode the display returns to 60hz. Is there a way to limit the CPU power without putting it power saving mode ? I find that it's the CPU that's uses more power and heats up the device in normal usage.	R

Hotspot issues	I use my s22 ultra as a hotspot when gaming. The problem is the games crash momentarily. Very often. I have tried my phone is safe mode and changed every setting and factory reset my phone. Nothing has worked. I put the sim card into my s21 ultra and it works perfectly. This is clearly a software issue and my phone is up to date on patches. When is Samsung going to patch this issue?	R
S22 Network Voice Calling Issues when connected to Wifi	When I'm connected to the Wifi and receive a phone call, I can hear from the incoming line, but they can't hear me. I've attempted to disconnect wifi calling, still no luck. I have to turn off wifi, then make a call or have the ability to receive a call. I've called Tmobile and they don't have any answers.	R
S22 Ultra S-Pen Air Command Menu and button issues	I don't like having balloon icons over other apps so I disabled the "Show air command icon" setting but left enabled the "Open Air command with Pen button" setting so I can bring up the menu when I hover the S-Pen tip over the screen and press the Pen button.However, when I press and hold the Pen button to use a feature such as select text or eraser, the Air command menu pops up after I release the button. It's actually somewhat erratic behaviour. In some apps, like the Note app, this doesn't happen if I hold the button to use the eraser function. However, in other apps using the eraser function will cause the menu to pop up once the button is released.Also, the menu will pop up even without releasing the button if the pen is moved more than about 1 cm from the screen. If the button is released while the pen is still touching the screen it doesn't happen. If I raise the tip above the screen, but still close, and wait a few seconds before releasing the button, the menu also doesn't pop up. But in most cases when using the button normally, the menu will tend to pop up then I need to hover and press the button again to close the menu. It's really annoying.Also, this only happens when "Air view" setting is disabled. If I enable Air view setting, I usually don't get the menu popping up unexpectedly. I prefer Air view being disabled because it can't be enabled at the same time as the accessibility Magnifier feature, which is really helpful when I don't have my glasses on. Of course, I try to use the S-Pen magnifier app as an alternative. Even with Air view on, holding the pen and dragging on the screen will cause the menu to pop up if you're also using the pen's magnifier app.If I disable the "Open Air command with Pen button" setting, of course this doesn't occur. But then I can't get the menu at all (unless I enable the floating button).I had a previous S22 Ultra that I exchanged and don't recall this problem, so I'm wondering if I just didn't notice it or if there's actually a hardware issue with my phone or pen.Can anyone confirm they experience the same behaviour?Thanks!

Such a disappointing camera	"Mainly ranting, but based on evidence in case you are interested.
I don't mean to just throw destructive comments out or flame. Whenever I get a new phone, I do in depth camera tests, side by side. At the moment I have in my power the Huawei P30, the S22 and the Pixel 6. With a huge difference the Pixel 6's camera is the best among these.
I already knew, because I compared them previously, that the S22 couldn't came close to the Pixel 6's camera, but the Pixel 6 is too big for me, so I decided to get the S22 as my new phone, since my P30 is starting to struggle significantly in a few aspects. However, when comparing the cameras of the P30 and the S22, sadly, the differences are barely noticeable, and sometimes the P30 even comes up ahead. The S22 wins only in processing power, especially for video, where it allows higher frame rates and resolutions. But for photography itself, comparing the photos on the same computer screen side by side, I expected much more from a premium device released 3 years after the P30.
It's really disappointing because I love how the S22 feels in my hand and got it for a good price, but it is most likely going to be returned and I'll wait for autumn to see what the iPhone 14 and the Pixel 7 have to offer camera-wise.
I really wanted to like the S22's camera, and I guess secretly I am hoping you tell me there's this magic button I'm missing that will unlock its full potential, but deep down I know it is what it is."	R
Photos Have Wrong Location - Continuing Problem with Upgraded Phone	All of the photos taken at my house incorrectly show the location taken about 6 houses away. (Google Maps shows my phone and I are at the correct location.) This was happening consistently on my Note 8 and now on my new S22 Ultra.But my wife's S9 photos had the correct location address, and her new S22 also adds the correct location to photos.So, apparently the incorrect location data on my photos is tied to one of my accounts.Any ideas to fix would be appreciated.

Galaxy S22 Ultra camera does not work	I pre-ordered this phone in early March... recieved it late March early April. Guess what... the camera doesn't work. I've contacted support via text and phone. Had to factory reset my phone 4x!. Then I was redirected to UBREAKIFIX, over 1.5hrs away! The rep told me that since it's a new phone, they do not have the parts for it and that no other location has it.They told me that Samsung would replace my phone however when I contacted another rep from Samsung, Jenny, who refused to give me her employee ID kept on on recommending me to try another UBIF location. I need my phone FOR my career, it's not just a J.O.B. & it's imperative that I am able to take pictures and videos.So how have I been dealing with this mishap...depending on co-workers!

S22+ connection problems. Battery issues and overheating.	I've had 2 S22+ model phones since the.end of April..

The speakers are cutting out occasionally as if they were in the back and top of the phone. Also have had extremely loud static blare for no reason. If you can get past that, the S22+ has some pretty cool features. I hope they can fix the bugs soon, because I really like this model.	R

S22 ultra	First off I'm loving the phone! However the battery life is horrible, with not even 2 hours of screen on time I'm already down to 50% after starting the day at 77% (didn't charge overnight) is it true that it does in fact get better if you wait a week?

Battery Issue	"I have noticed that the phone would shut off anytime the battery is in 1-5% range (whilst I am using it). This was never the case with my S10+.

I am maxed on the settings AND with adaptive brightness set to on AND 5G disabled.
User for \~14 days now.
Also, I see that factory reset is recommended here for battery related issue. If I were to do that, how do I get  my old data over to new phone ? I used the samsung cloud restore (using my S10+ and S22u side-by-side on same wifi network)

Extremely slow charging on S22 ultra in spite of phone displaying fast charging.	"Hi all, 
So I just bought an S22 ultra. I have turned on fast charging and super fast charging from the settings. I am using my 65W macbook pro 2016 charger. Now I have 2 things that I need some clarity on. 
1) When I connect the charger the phone displays fast charging but but the phone takes an awfully long time to charge. I tested the charging and it took almost 2.5 hours to go from 0 to 100.  I don't understand if there is something wrong with the phone or if there is something that I'm getting wrong.
2) The charger I'm using is a 65W PD charger and S22 ultra requires 45W PD charger to superfast charge, then why does the phone display fast charging and not superfast charging?
Would really appreciate some insight on this.Thanks a lot in advance. 😁"	R
Can't palm swipe screenshot	Just ditched my Fold3.

It wasn't doing this when I first set up my phone but I'm sure gboard has updated a few times since then. Anyone else's Gboard being finicky? I tried redownloading it but it's doing the same thing. (the google play store didn't even want to load the gboard page at first)"	R

Has anyone had issues with bluetooth dropping out in the past couple of weeks? My S22U keeps losing connection to Galaxy Buds Pro &amp; Galaxy Watch4. Tried clearing cache in the bluetooth system app but didn't seem to help.	Just looking for suggestions if anyone figured out how to maintain the bluetooth connection recently: seems be a problem since the last system update-- my watch or earbuds will just randomly lose connection even when the phone is within inches of the device. It drops then reconnects itself after a few minutes. Saw suggestions on samsung help about clearing cache in the bluetooth app, removing &amp; reconnecting devices, setting Wearables app not to timeout, etc. but it's still intermittently dropping a couple of times per day. I've never had that problem with prior Galaxy phones &amp; devices.	R

Samsung S22 screen flickering	I use my phone to read ebooks. I primarily read before bed when my room is pitch black dark and there is absolutely no other source of light. The phone is set to dark mode, The screen brightness is set to the lowest and I also engage the extra dim feature. While in this setup, the screen flickers, it's kinda faint but never the less super annoying to read anything. Has anyone experienced this issue ? It's very noticeable especially when switching pages, opening tabs and going through the phones settings menu. It's worse when the display is at 60HZ. I tried to record a video of it with another phone but it's too dark to capture. I tried doing this with my wife's pixel 6 my old pixel 3 and my old Samsung Galaxy 8 and there was zero flickering under the same brightness settings and while viewing the same pages and conducting the same tasks so it seems exclusive for the s22. However I do not have another s22 or know anybody in person that has an s22 to try it with and see if it's only exclusive to mine or a common issue, if anybody wants to try it and let me know that would be helpful. I contacted Samsung, but they gave me the usual factory reset your phone and it should go away. I did factory reset it and it is still the same. Honestly I feel like this is a software issue. I just wish this issue could be relay to the developers so they could fix it.	R

major issue with Samsung s22+	Seen similar reports on forums no proper fix yet..only getting worse and worse overtime. Every since May security patch there has been issues with microphone,camera and how they work with 3rd party apps and even integrated apps. Example when it occurs you cannot use the phones camera to record any video photage at all the timer will be stuck at 0.00. on Snapchat it will show that it's recording but when you let go of the record button all you are left with is a picture. The microphone issue is same you can't use microphone to record any voice messages. This goes deeper. You can't play any videos on any app including Instagram, specially if volume is enabled. Gallery cannot play any video within the phone it will also be stuck at 0.0. only short term Fix rn is rebooting. But common how many times do I have to do this a day. makes most of the phone unusable. No clue if Samsung is working on fix in June update but no clue when that's coming	R
Bluetooth audio when in video call distorts other audio	"I always on a video call with my damily as i am far away from them. But we just open the video call and do our own things. I used whatsapp picture in picture  feature that lets me play youtube while still in the video call. I mainly use my bluetooth headset when video call. But when i use it, it distorts the audio played in youtube and other music app, not the video call.
Example:
1. Youtube videos n spotify sounds scratchy
2. I need to increase the in call volume to increase the audio from youtube
I bought this s22 from april n kinda regret buying it. My previous phone differentiate the audio from my video call and other music app and still output to the same bluetooth headset. But s22 feels like it merge the sound into an in call sound. It really bothers me.
Im sorry if this post is not clear. English is not my first language, sorry for that. Do i need to change some settings to differentiate the sound from call and song?"	R

Even when i use my front facing camera for video call, the back camera heats so much. Does anyone had the same problem? Or anyone had solution for this?	R
For a phone that's over $1,000 this is just unacceptable.	"Coming from an S10+ this is still a major upgrade for me but there are just significant issues that makes this honestly a worse experience than the S10+ because they are interfer in a major way in terms of basic usage.
1. The notification motor is very very weak compared to the S10+. If you don't use audio your phone is essentially silent. I don't use audio at work...
2. The finger print scanner is worse, my S10+ could be wet and still let me sign in 
3. My biggest complaint is the battery. I'm on the latest update and it's still not fixed. I'm running through multiple cycles that will leave this phone's battery unusable in probably less than 2 years. When my phone gets to 10% it goes to 5% then 1% in 10 minutes or less, and that's if I'm lucky. Usually it will just turn off at 5%. On my 10+ I could be on 1% for 10+ min. You can claim it's the resolution or refresh rate but the iphone can have these things without needinh to be charged everyday. I'm also not doing anything crazy with this phone is just Reddit, Whatsapp, TikTok and Instagram. 
I seriously would NOT recommend this phone over the iPhone just considering this phone now just costs so much. Big screw up by Samsung here, and with LG gone, it's really up to Google to provide a high quality Android experience.
Edit: I see comments swearing it's a base issue. I am using a Ultra and have 6-7hrs of SOT. When brand new the 10+ I charged every other day, this one is daily out the box"	R
Notification Sound issue, Plays 2 seconds then cuts off with delay and finishes after	"Anyone have or know a fix for this?

Then 3 seconds later it plays the remaining duration of the sound.
I'm not sure how to fix this...but it's driving me crazy. Never had any of my Note phones do this or my Fold."	R
Problem when charging S22	Hi everyone. I just bought my S22 for about a month ago. i notice that when i use my phone during charging, i got a problem using the keyboard. It always press more than one letter or it press the letter double or even triple. Can anyone help with this problem or get did problem?	R
My brand new S22 charges extremely slowly (or not at all) through my car	"My S10 had zero problems and charged quickly, and I was able to use Android Auto and also be plugged in to a car and play Pokemon Go. Charging would maybe slow down a little bit and phone could get a little warmer faster, but was still completely fine.
Well, even if I am doing absolutely nothing with the phone other than plugging it in and Android Auto pops up on my car screen, not even using Maps at the time, I am lucky to get 2-3% charge in 20+ minutes. If I do have Go running, it get scorching hot very fast and will charge even slower, if at all, and sometimes loses charge. The same happens when I use an external battery pack while out playing Go. 
I had ONE day during Go Fest (8+ hours of play time) where my battery/charging experience while playing go was pretty normal, but I have no idea why it was only that one day. It was really bad at first, and then I didn't change any settings or anything (the night before I had wiped the cache partition in safe boot) but it just suddenly improved. The next day, awful again and even worse since. 
So does this mean I am now screwed and will not be able to charge my phone from my car, or play Go and charge it with a battery pack like every single other phone? 
I am going to swap it for another one next weekend if it has not improved, but I do not think it will matter as everything I've seen online says the battery and overheating are terrible. I just haven't been able to find an answer or really much of anything about car charging (I found one forum that suggested a certain Belkin Boost Plus cord, didn't work) or battery packs or Pokemon Go. 
Any tips would be great. I am so pissed I upgraded my phone to this now because it is entirely useless for one of the things I used to use on my phone a lot and now I basically can't."	R
Ghost images?	"My notifications, battery percentage and even the time on the clock have left a ghost image. How?? It wasn't there yesterday and it is today, and it's very specific. The time and my notifications change all the time, but a few seem to have gotten stuck.
And I've had the phone for just under 2 months of usage."	R
Ringtone on S22 Ultra regularly turns down to lowest unmuted volume	This happens every single day and it's driving me nuts. This is a business phone so I'm regularly missing important calls from customers and employees. Has anyone else experienced this? One thing I should mention is that it's bluetooth connected regularly to my galaxy buds and the system in my Jeep.	R
Lose WIFI calling when activating dual SIM	I converted my Tmo SIM to an esim and when used alone, WIFI calling works fine. However when I activate a second line (physical SIM with US Mobile), I suddenly can't make any calls/texts via WIFI using my Tmo line even though it remains switched on. The WIFI calling works perfectly with US Mobile however. I have Tmo SIM as my primary SIM in settings. I initially thought this was an issue with T-mobile but I am now beginning to think this is a S22 problem. Any thoughts?	R
Moving on to the S22 but not happy about it	"I got my snapdragon S21 ultra in February of '21. I previously had a LG V30 and before that a Droid Turbo. Both of those phones I loved and kept for 3 years each until software and batteries started to deteriorate. I never loved huge phones. My criteria was software support, large battery/battery life, wireless charging, the best camera possible, and ability to be used internationally. LG and Motorola had effectively exited the flagship space, and I don't like the apple ecosystem, so that leaves me with Samsung, google, and potentially a sony xperia. Sony was missing key bands and wasn't supported on verizon, so that was out. The pixel 5 was extremely underwhelming to me. So when the S21 ultra was released, I pulled the trigger.
When it arrived, the camera was easily the highlight. Best camera I've had on a phone, and the 3x and 10x lenses were great. Certainly still had some things I'd like to see improved, but for a point and shoot, pretty good. The battery I've been less than impressed with, it died on an epic hike (half dome in Yosemite) I was doing when it was in my pocket 95% of the time with wifi and bluetooth off, less than 12 hours (and it was 100% at the start) and I feel has been worse than either of my two previous phones. Wifi will continuously disconnect despite no other device in my house doing so. I've also never had a device overheat before, this happened multiple times with my S21 ultra. Usually when it was plugged into my car using android auto and taking a phone call, I don't find this acceptable. 
Saturday, randomly, I got a black screen of death. No damage, nothing caused it, just decided to stop working. This is a known issue with S21's. I contacted Samsung and they created a ticket for me at a cell phone repair facility. I mistakenly thought this would mean they would cover it under warranty. Nope, they just made an appointment, and it would cost me $300. When I got to the facility, they said they didn't have the part needed, and directed me to another location. I was unable to call due to my phone situation to confirm. I get to the new location and they say they have the part, but their testing software is broken, so they can't do the repair. I drive to two more locations, and no one can help. The only option left would be to send my phone into Samsung and have them repair it (all at my expense), but that would take two weeks, and I need my phone for work. So I looked around to see what offers were available on new phones. Apparently Samsung has a promotion on the S22 Ultra that I can send in my broken S21 ultra and get the new version for $175....less than it would cost me to repair my current phone.
Now after this experience, I honestly don't want the S22 which I hear has some of the same (and some new!) issues as the S21, but this is the best of a lot of bad options, and when new phones are released this year, will put me in a better position to get one of those if they appeal to me. Also, my new phone will be here tomorrow, faster than I could have gotten it fixed anywhere else. So if you are in the same boat, and want a change, or your screen is broken, look into this option for yourself."	R
Help - issues with Galaxy S22+ reconnecting to the network	I've had a nagging issue with my phone (Galazy S22+) being unable to reconnect to the network (Verizon) after coming out of a place with no service. Occasionally (not every time bit enough to notice) I will emerge from an elevator, parking garage, or some other place without cell service and find that my Galaxy S22+ will not reconnect. It will show no service or wifi, no connection at all. I usually have to either do a reboot of my phone or toggle airplane mode for it to reconnect. Any one else have this issue and have a fix? I tried googling and scanning through this sub and didn't see much that fit the bill.	R
Cat S22 Flip Call Forwarding Not Working	My work just switched to T Mobile and gave us this basic Cat S22 Flip phone for our on call phone. We usually just forward this phone to our i phones when we're on call. We have been dealing with our rep, tech support and even t mobile engineering to figure out why we can't get call forwarding to work. We tried **21 and **61 and trying to enable call forwarding through android on the phone and it doesn't work. My theory is because mobile data is not enabled on this phone. Can anyone here help? Thanks.	R
Wifi calling not working	Need help. Wifi calling is enabled but is not working. I've tried turning on airplane mode then wifi to force and I cannot call out. I had an unlocked s22 unlocked on Verizon (wifi calling didn't work), bought iphone 13 pro max ( wifi calling worked), hated iphone so I went back to a Verizon and bought s22 ultra (wifi calling not working). I don't understand why wifi calling doesn't work on the Samsungs unlocked and locked but it does on my family's iphones. Wifi calling and everything is enabled on my account. Does anyone have any tips before I call customer service tomorrow? I feel like I've tried everything. Reset phone and reset network settings, turned wifi calling on and off, reset router, bought different phone, disabled and re enabled wifi calling in Verizon account. Very frustrating. Previous phone s21 ultra unlocked worked just fine on wifi calling.	R

Coming from s21u this has aways worked. I've noticed on my s22u that after about a day it's like Bixby doesn't hear me. The pop-up window appears as if Bixby is listening, but there is no microphone icon in said window. Data cache clear does not fix this, but restart does fix this issue, whether I've cleared the data or not.

Nothing I've tried has worked, I tried immediately pressing delete when it starts but it just deleted my saved messages. Also I tried looking in visual voicemail but it's not synced even though it says it is. I would just love a solution to this because the notifications are stuck up there.

Camera lag even after June update	"I don't think it's the shutter lag since even in daylight, the camera app is laggy. Taking a picture then immediately moving around the viewfinder is very choppy and it takes another 2 seconds to be able to take another picture properly (until the previous photo has completed processing I believe).
I've already factory reset my phone and wiped cache to no avail. This is not an issue using alternative camera apps such as Expert RAW.

S22+ June update slowed down the phone	"I guess I was one of the few lucky ones that barely had any performance issues, and okayish battery life...until now.
I recently installed the June update (there were 2) on my S22+ (SD) and performance seems to have taken a bad hit. These are the problems I've observed:
1. Camera is especially slow to open, and the viewfinder is rather choppy - which wasn't a problem before.
2. Apps seem to be in some sort of deep sleep mode, even the pull down menu is laggy when the phone is woken up at times.
3. Changing the battery mode to ""high performance"" hasn't helped. 
Anyone else have similar issues?"	R
S22 Ultra - worth sending in for repair?	"My three month old S22 Ultra just developed a bunch of dead pixels on the top right of my screen - about 5mm wide cluster. Now there's no physical damage and it's covered under warranty, but is it worth sending the phone for repair?
I've had a bad experience where the screen was replaced on my Note 8 and the new screen developed a new crack every week (non Samsung repair and no drops).
The dead pixels don't bother me much, but is it worth having your phone unsealed for a new screen? And would the screen be as good as a new screen and not crack without reason?"	R

extereme screen dimming issue post June update	"My s22ultra (256 gb, snapdragon) has been having brightness issues post the June 1700mb update (been 24 hours since the update).

Apps do not stay in memory?	"I noticed that I had about 3-4 apps running in total. The first app that I used was launched about 1 min ago. When I went back and opened all of the apps from the recents menu, they all relaunched from the splash screen. 
Super confusing considering this is a 12GB RAM flagship smartphone. It can't even keep 4 apps open that were closed recently.

Amazon Music app randomly closing while not being used	"I am losing my mind here... When not used for whatever random amount of time (can range from a few minutes to a whole day) the Amazon Music app will close, and wherever I was on a playlist is simply... LOST. What a stupid design to lack some kind of caching to resume.
I had this issue with my Galaxy S9+ and then somebody recommended I try installing Gook Luck -&gt; MultiStar and then enabling the Long Live App. Well, THAT worked! And I wouldn't have to start my 500+ song playlists over again which made getting through it impossible.
Well, here I am with an S22 now... And... The Long Live App doesn't seem to exist. Once again, I am hating my phone. I've tried Tidal to see if it would remain open, but seems not and also seems to forget where it was. Playlist position is lost and forced to start over. I am beyond frustrated that the phone appears to be closing these apps despite setting them to unrestricted and to not sleep them, nevermind whoever at these app teams can't come up with a no brainer should exist without even having to think about it ability to resume where you left off option.
Anyone have a solution for this phone?  
EDIT NOTE:  
This also occurs with Tidal and Apple Music. However this \[dumb\] phone (either Samsung or the OS) handles memory seems to be responsible. After a random amount of time in the background not actively playing music, the app dies (the player is wiped from the notification window) and when you open it again it's as if you were never listening to anything and have to start over.

Glitches when watching a video	"Anyone notice occasional glitches (like, horizontal lines like TV static across the display) when watching a video? 
After some research, I've realize this happens when the video is 24 or less FPS so the display adapts from 120 to 24 and at that instant, it glitches for that millisecond switch. I've noticed it mostly on Samsung Internet when watching a video on Video Player. Also sometimes when tapping the fingerprint icon when only the icon is visible and the rest of the screen is black.
Current fix so far is to set the motion smoothness to Standard (60 Hz)

Most disappointing Samsung device I've ever owned.	"S22U, Tmo, no screen protector, day 1 preorder owner.
I am so over this phone.
The 'hiccups' I rarely experienced on my N20U are now daily frustrations on this phone.  I am to the point that after I try a factory reset, I'm giving this back to TMobile and leaving Samsung entirely.  10 years I've been a Samsung user and I'm done with this overpriced bug machine.  I don't go more than 10 mins without becoming frustrated when I use this phone.
Delayed inputs across the device including but not limited to typing, tapping, swiping.  Skipping on inputs, ghosting my tap to a different spot, what amounts to 'lag' where my inputs rubberband or queue up and then all input at once.
I have never experienced such MISERABLE Bluetooth connectivity.  Every time I connect a device it will have audio turned off even if it's literally a speaker.  Sometimes I can tap the audio slider and it turns on.  Most of the time it immediately greys out and switches off or turns on and a second later turns off.  I have to turn the audio on/back on every time I go out of range or connect a device.  It's 30s-2 mins of extra time every single connection.
I am experiencing the Android 11 controller bug despite being Android 12 and nothing is fixing it.
I have visual lag, visual stuttering, slowness that began mere weeks into owning the phone that one doesn't experience until months down the line with a full storage and app drawer.  I only have 4 apps on this phone that I didn't have on my N20U and overall trimmed my app list down extensively after I upgraded.
I reboot my phone, on top of the scheduled restarts, at least once a day.  When I do so, the Tmo sign flashes, stutters, lags, hangs, and double plays when turning on and off.
I have atrocious signal and WiFi on known, solid networks and in known solid areas.  Standing side by side my husband with his G20 on the same plan and network he will usually have signal where I do not.
The performance and connection in apps, again that me and my husband or me and my daughter (who has my N20U) both share (Like playing DI, Hearthstone, or PoGo, or even just GasBuddy or FB Messenger), is vastly worse on my phone.
It appears the overlay function on this phone is entirely bugged and Messenger is a chore to use.  If I click on a picture or video, it will overlay on top of everything and freeze, making my phone unresponsive and leaving the icons (like the time bar or whatnot) on screen.  Even if I regain control, it will flicker over my screen until I force close FB Messenger.
The same thing happens randomly in other apps or just while sitting on the home screen.
The entire phone becomes unresponsive numerous times a day where the entire screen does not respond to taps and the volume buttons no longer work.  If I have Spotify playing in the background, it will continue to play and can be controlled via the connected device.  It can last for 30 seconds up to 5 mins which is the longest I've waited before rebooting the phone.
Typing delay in all apps with any keyboard is infuriating.  The 1-10 second lack of input where you type and nothing appears after tapping a text field happens almost every single time.
My camera is becoming unresponsive as well.  I used to miss a pic once a while and now I have to hit the shutter button, see the sort of jitter that indicates a pic has been taken, and then watch the lower left gallery preview of the last pic to see if it took.  I have to take a pic, or tap the shutter button, upwards of 10 times before a pic is taken.  Videos, pfft, I miss everything that comes my way.  It's to the point I literally don't even take pics.  I grab for my husband's/daughter's phone and just share it back to myself.
Most of my apps that I'd want to use the SPen with do not support it.  I understand that's not a problem with the phone but the app makers but that was my main draw to this phone.  The flagship, always the best, built in stylus, stayed square and big.  It was very helpful for my visual and motor needs.  But now I have to always carry a standard stylus with me and rarely reach for the SPen other than as a shutter.  I used to use the SPen multiple times a day.  I use full gesture commands, no bottom bar, and the SPen doesn't like that.  I have to tap things multiple times because it doesn't like the angle I hold it at, it wants straight perpendicular to the phone not at an angle.  And again not the phones fault, but I can't write with it anymore because I have to hold it in a way that makes me tremor.  So without the SPen there's no reason to have an S22U.  Slightly unrelated but the placement on the left makes it seem less accessible to me as well.
So...yeah.  I refuse to get a refurb used device and still have to pay full price for it which is what Asurion/Tmo will do if I call them with these issues.  I'm factory resetting and if these issues persist, I'm out of the Galaxy family.  And it hurts bad man.  I've been a fan for so long, staunchly supporting Samsung.  Got their beans, their watch..which if I'm honest have had a myriad of issues as well...but...
I've seen what appear to be isolated hardware issues from other people but is this whole kaboodle something others are experiencing?"	R
apps opening randomly	"I have an S22 base model. For some reason, apps will randomly open without me pressing on anything.
For example, while I was riding with my phone in the phone holder on my scooter and I had maps open navigating a route, my security cameras app opened, which forced me to pull over and close it, and switch back to maps.

Base S22 SD Battery Life after June update	"I've been on the June update for 3 days now and I've observed that my battery life is shorter now compared to the last update. The last May update, my phone can last for 4-5hrs SOT with a total usage of 8-9hrs. Now, I've been having 3 and a half hours of SOT with a total usage of 6hrs. Same use, social media, youtube, 30mins gaming, texting/calling, playing music.
I have cleared the cache after installing the update. I'm curious if the phone would analyse the usage pattern after an update? or did it just made the battery life bad again?
I've seen some issues with camera but I do not have this problem with mine, instead of that, my issue is with battery (again).

S- pen menu won't go away	Anyone else having this issue since the latest update? Upon pulling the S-pen out of its slot on my S22 Ultra, if I already have notes and/or internet and/or multiple other apps running, the s-pen menu won't go away. I've programmed the phone to open the menu when releasing the spen and when pressing the s-pen button when hovering but even if I choose an app from the s-pen menu, the menu itself won't disappear. Whatever app i chose is opened, but i can't get to it because it's behind the spen menu. The only way to resolve it is to hold down the physical buttons on the side of my phone for 30-40 seconds and until it restarts.Also, is it just me, or has the s-pen tip degraded in quality since the last Note version? I've never had to replace a tip before, but this tip is nearly a nub now. And not anywhere near as fine a point as when I first received the phone 4 months ago. And it seems the tips themselves are no longer replaceable. I now need to shell out $50(!!) for an entire new pen?

There is a very obvious sound difference and I know some people has said the speaker on the phone is quiet but I think it's a software problem because it plays horrible over Bluetooth devices as well. It's so quiet and when you turn the volume up all the way the distortion is way worse than my note 9 ever was. Please help! because I haven't found no other issues as of yet and I am loving the rest of the phone. In car using Android auto is the most noticable. If it cant be fixed I would have to tune my cars sound system just to make the sound decent.	R
Camera and Video call freeze and crash frequently	My S22 Ultra phone's camera freezes , hangs frequently while I am on Video call, using camera or face unlock. This has become an annoying issue whenever it occurs. It's disappointing to see such a disgusting failure on a costly phone like S22 Ultra.Samsung support is of no use , I shipped the phone to them for repair but of no use, they just sent me back saying no issue found. They asked me to try not loading backup and just use the phone afresh. I did the same but still the same issue showed up back in two days.Any recommendations to find the root cause of the issue from community will help me. I attached one example of the failure in the below image.	R

Main Camera Error help pls	"I wipe my phone cache because i read here that would help to improve my battery and was good to the phone after an update in general

I've already wipe cache again and selected repair apps, nothing worked, I'm kind of lost her, if anyone has a suggestion or a way to check if is a hardware problem that i wasnt aware of, would be helpful

Lower touch sensitivity when screen is off	Please [give an option to] lower the screen's touch sensitivity on locked device when screen is completely off, as I explain.My S22 Ultra is constantly being touch activated in my pocket. This is causing all sorts of annoyances. Playing music being started/stopped/jumped.. I have hundreds of screen shots of the emergency dialer and passcode attempts. And this is from just one week of having this device. When connected to bluetooth earphones, I can literally hear the key press tones with every step. When this gets going, i.e. the screen has been activated, every time the phone touches my leg (with the pocket fabric in between them) I hear a key press and/or a music change.I currently have to flip my phone so that the screen is facing outwards, when doing my runs, so that the music doesn't get messed up.AOD: offAlways on fingerprint reader: offIncreased sensitivity: offAccidental touch protection: onScreen is completely black and needs a double-tap (or key press) to activate. I set it this way in hopes to solve this matter (and to conserve battery). Didn't help.	R

Bluetooth connections with S22	Ive had my S22 for about a month now and I'm so disappointed in the Bluetooth operation!It will not connection to various bluetooth items. 😞Nothing automatically connects after the pairing 😒Its taken 5-6 tries to connect and then that's not a guarantee 😔I have great skull candies cans- won't pair.I have great Blackwell buds - won't stay connected.Between that and the short battery life?

S22+ starred messages no longer protected?	Just upgraded to S22+ last month and have always used starred messages in texts to save pics or important info like address, contact info, etc. that I received in a text. Previously, you could star a message, and delete the entire text thread, and only the starred messages would remain. I see that someone else posted about this about 3 months ago, just checking to see if anyone had an update? Is there any way to protects single texts in a thread so they don't delete? Or do you literally need to delete every single text one by one except the ones you want to protect? Tia...	R

S22 connecting to wifi that has no internet	I was wondering if people had experience with this issue. I am trying to connect to a device that has no internet to set it up. The device is a dash cam and it requires me to connect to its Wi-Fi but every time I do it will say there's no internet and then it will try to connect to my home Wi-Fi instead and it will keep doing that and it won't stay on the Wi-Fi that does not have any internet.

Very poor (orange-yellowish) indoor photos	Was at an indoor dinner last week and took many pics with my S22 Ultra indoors, in a brightly lit room. Every picture shows people as having orange/yellowish tint, and the backgrounds washed out. I didn't change from any of the default settings. The same pics taken with a relative's iPhone 13 were spectacular, and true to life. Is my phone defective, or is there a setting I missed? They're really awful. Thank you.	R

s22 ultra gets screen doesn't light up when unlocked	"I've reported the issue to Samsung members app. After the june update my screen just doesn't light up at times when the phones goes into sleep or when unlocking.

Galaxy Store issues	"I reset my Galaxy Tab S8+ yesterday and after setting it up again, every time I open the Galaxy Store, I get [this](https://i.imgur.com/cfc9CPE.jpg).
I thought maybe something went wonky during the tablet reset, so I tried opening it on my Galaxy S22 Ultra and got the same exact thing.

Humidity in Charging Port on S22 Ultra	"Hey guys
Since the latest update which I installed last week, I freqeuently get the warning that there is humidity in the charging port on my S22 Ultra. I've let it dry for some time now and also put it in front of a ventilator.  But it won't stop and I can't charge it with a cable anymore...
Does somebody have this issue aswell?
Thanks!"	R
Has Anyone Figured Out Why Charging Has Slowed Down?	I've noticed for a while that my phone isn't charging as fast as it used to. I thought I was mistaken and didn't really pay attention until recently. Now I'm noticing that my S22 tells me it'll take an hour to charge up, but it really takes two; which didn't used to be the case. I searched the sub and Google, and I noticed several reports of this change. Does anyone have any insight into this? Like maybe one of the updates screwed up the charging.	R
S22 ultra notifications and Bluetooth speaker problem	"When I'm connected to a Bluetooth speaker I would like to get notification sounds through the phones speaker, but I can't seem to find any solutions for this??

S22 Ultra randomly shuts its self off	Hey all, figured I'd reach out here to see if this is a common issue before having to send my phone in to Samsung and go without it for a few days. It seems that anytime I try to do more than one task at a time on the phone, the whole thing crashes and it forces itself off. I use android auto and sometimes using the phone while it's connected will cause it to crash, It also crashed during a music festival a couple weekends back due to the heat, and it also crashes when I use GPS apps to track my mileage or when I'm trying to do doordash to make some side money. So far the only common denominator is that it's when im running multiple things at once. My guess is the phone is just defective and Samsung will have to send me a new one. My storage is only half full and the phone is in perfect condition physically, BestBuy also did a diagnostics scan and nothing came up. Thanks in advance for any help/advice anyone is able to offer!	R
[S22+] Call dropping issue	"Has anyone experienced that after a few minutes of conversation through a regular phone call one party stops hearing the other, bit call seems to continues until someone end's it. After that, it is not possible to make another call or use mobile data for the next few minutes until the device ""recovers"".
The issue recurs even after factory reset, the usual restart, turning on-off airplane mode, and restarting network settings, all in an area of excellent signal coverage (city). The same thing happens with other SIM cards on the same device, from different providers. The device did not suffer any mechanical damage. I regularly check for software updates as well as app updates through GooglePlay and GalaxyStore."	R
S22+ Charging Problems	"Hey guys,
I am currently using Samsung's Super fast charging brick with the default cable that came with my S22+. However, if I disable Super Fast Charging in the settings, and only enable fast charging, my phone does not fast charge but cable charges.
When also using a powerbank and switching to a 2.0A port from a 4.0A port, the phone does not charge (says connect charger).
I never had such problems with my previous S9, it was working perfectly.
Under Samsung diagnostics my phone is able to charge normally.

New S22 everything works but 90% of my podcasts.	"I have tried multiple podcast apps (google, pocketcast, stitcher, and others) and most of the will not stream or download to the phone. I have deleted all cache, the apps and reinstalled them all, removed every data restriction I can find and still unable to stream, or download them. 
I have tried on my WiFi and 4G network and it is the same result. I tried the same podcasts on my old phone and everything still works fine on my Galaxy S10. If I go to the podcast website in my browser, I can stream them just fine as well.
All other apps like Youtube and Netflix etc can download content just fine to the phone but podcasts, only about 1/10 of them work. I cannot find any consistency between the ones that do and seems completely random.
Never had a problem like this, any help is appreciated."	R

Should I return my S22?	Bought an S22 and have been using it for a week now. I get a total of 1.5-2 hours SOT during the day before the battery dies (From 100&gt;5%: 07:00 - 22:00 SOT 2hrs). Coming from an S10+ that easily gets me through the day with messaging, checking mails and some reading (occassional photo here and there) the battery of the S22 feels absolutely terrible. I do have NFC and Bluetooth on all the time and am using Dark Mode as a default. No apps that are really draining my battery. I really don't want to be using the energy saving mode or any other tricks during the day to make it work. The 2 hours really feels like I have a defective device and I am strongly considering returning it. Should I simply return it, or will SOT get better after a second week? Really disappointed. I love the form factor.	R
very dissipated with my s22 ultra performance with media and games	"I'm having several annoying issues with phone(snapdragon version) , but the most frustrating one is when i play a movie for example it doesn't run smoothly , there some kind of lag or droping frames , i test this with deferent player like MX player VLC and the gallery.

connection to cellular.	"Is anyone else having problems with their 22s connecting the cellular and dropping at random times?
I'm back on my Note 9 because my 22+ would connect up to 5G then down to 4G then I would have no signal at all. Or I would go for a drive and lose data connection. I would have to restart my phone just to get any type of data signal back. I have US Cellular and never had that problem on my Note 9."	R
got the s22 ultra and a week later the device powers off on it's own about every 10 min	"It started two days ago and I was browsing my Google feed when the phone just powered off. I turned it back on and right away it did it again. The phone wasn't over heating but the charge was about 15% so I let it charge for the night. The next day it was fine for about 8 hours when it started doing it again. The first time I was opening an email, the second time I was making a phone call. Then about every 30 min, no matter what I was doing the phone would just shut down. Now today,I tried doing a factory reset and systems reset, changed the performance mode, and did a systems check which everything was fine was it's only a week old anyways. But now it turns off about every 5-10 min and is pretty much unusable.
Called Samsung and since I'm within 15 days (I can't believe you get 15 days) the only option I have is buy another phone while sending this one back to eventually get a refund. They said they had no option to exchange and I ended up paying $20 more than I did originally. I asked what would have happened if I was past 15 days? Basically the only other option. And I would have had to send it in to be fixed and wait for them to repair it and send it back."	R

Audio Playback Issue	For some reason all my Bluetooth devices are making an odd sound in the right earbud, as if someone is blowing in the mic of the right earbud. Normally, I would think the earbud is broken, but the distortion is happening across all my Bluetooth earbuds. So, I know it's my phone that's malfunctioning. I tried restarting my phone, and it did not fix the issue. I also tried unpairing the devices, which also did not work. I tried play music on different music apps, only to find the same issue on all of them. The sound usually comes when there is heavy bass.

S22+ USB C Port Loose	I have had some charging issues with my S22+. The cable is pretty loose, so I cleaned it out with a plastic toothpick where I did see some compacted lint/debris. The cable charges better now, however every cable I have is still pretty loose, and has some give up and down.	R
S22 Keyboard issue still not fully fixed.	"The problem is regarding the early termination of swiping on the keyboard. Since owning this phone, swiping a word can be interrupted if you go to certain spots. This includes swiping too high that you hit the number row, or swiping from the right end to the left end to the right again. This effect happened regardless of whether you have a case or not. And for me, I use the phone one handed (happens even when holding with both hands). 
Today I did the manual update using *#2663# on the dial pad (TSP FW Update). Not sure if it's the same as the June update. Certain words are fixed but these words consistently are early terminated (with the left hand):
* Happens
* Handed
* Okay
This does not happen with my S8. Notably this has happens less if I purposefully hi slowly and have none of my fingernail touch the screen. But this was never an issue for the S8, so why is it an issue now? I hope others have some solution to this because having swipe bug out when typing is pretty terrible. Can't get a sentence out without repeatedly backspacing."	R

Bad performance while playing world of tanks blitz	"I have a 256gb snapdragon.
I'm getting worse than expected performance in the game. I have all graphics settings maxed in game with my phone in 1440p and 120hz.

Unbelievably frustrated	I've been posted been I'm trying to figure out how to get this bored hacker out of my devices: 58"Samsung 4HK 1080p TV, Vizio V51 5.1 Sound system, my laptop, my S3 gear watch and recently limited the volume on my s22 ultra using the volume linit control option. I know...i tried and he locked it with his own personal pin before i could myself. Now my surround and buds+ as well as phone are weak cause I'm hard of hearing(rough work environment). I've been digging, researching and learninh as much as possible and found he protects his links to my phone i believe in the my files app which he has locked in the secure folder app and yes he personally pin locked it as well. I've tried to make things as difficult as i could but dude loves watching me curse and throw things i believe. Oh yeah i find random screenshots, pics and videos alike in my galleries too. I love tech and what it does in my daily life. Dude is is killin my mojo. Anyone got any ideas. I've had techs scratching their heads at the things he's done to my stuff. I REALLY could use some useful help. I've tried everything i can think of guys. Thanks foe your time!	R

Roaming clock not working	Earlier today the roaming clock on the lock screen was working. But after a couple hours it stopped.

S22 Ultra Glitchy	I've had my S22 Ultra since March, it was working great then all of a sudden it started to glitch. It does it at random when I'm typing and makes the whole screen jump. Doesn't matter what app I'm in. I've noticed that if I have Facebooks chat heads on my screen they are transparent for the first couple seconds before I open the chat. Once the chat is open, the photo of the person I'm chatting with glitches and then proceeds to glitch as I type before it decides to stop. When updating apps it takes forever to update them if I tell it to update all. I end up doing them all individually. It also keeps disconnecting me from wifi even when I'm home. I've done all the software updates, app updates. I've cleared the cache more than once, reset my phone and it still happens. I did have one instance when restarting the phone, the entire screen went mint green, was asking about installing some update and would not let me turn my phone off. Anyone else having similar issues? What else can I try or should I just take it in to my phone provider?	R
won't play mp3 from home screen	"S22 Ultra with latest updates 
I have an mp3 audio file that used to play from my home screen.  it stopped working and just hangs with a black bar at the top of the screen and a white one at bottom.  i may have hit something incorrectly when  the popup  ""use every time"" displayed but can't be sure.

Surprisingly bad indoor photos of documents vs. the 3yo Huawei P30 Pro	"I kept hearing about the S22 Ultra's ""Nightography"" capabilities, so I was really surprised to see how much noise it captured in the shadow area of this receipt I had lying around.

Thermal Throttling When Playing Pokemon Go	"My S22 is dimming the screen from being too hot to the point I can hardly see it while outside. I have been trying everything I can think of for a month now and I can't fix this issue.   
Yes, I am outside while using it, but I am within the temperature parameters Samsung recommends (95F is the hottest standard operating temp, it was only 89F when testing this today). I was outside for 5 minutes after factory resetting my device and was still experiencing a very dim screen.   
I have tried turning off adaptive brightness, game launcher, auto manage temperature and brightness. I have tried clearing the cache partition. I have tried factory resetting. I have tried turning on battery saving in the app. I have tried limiting CPU usage, increasing memory, decreasing memory. Nothing.   
I reached out to Samsung support to discuss the issue, but they were not much help either. The only thing I can think of left to do is to trade it in."	R
Screwy keyboard?	"Anyone having issues with their keyboard? Adding extra duplicate letters, adding completely wrong letters, inserting spaces...?

Speaker crackling for notifications	"Hey all, I am facing a weird issue with my S22. The speaker tends to crackle for notifications. Like the speaker membrane broke. But when i play music and watch youtube, it is fine. It only happens for notifications. I read in google that its a hardware issue, but I don't think so in my case since there are no issues for youtube, music, but only for notifications. 
Returns are likely out of the question as i dont stay in the US but they do honor warranties. Anyone else facing the same issue?"	R
S22+ Fingerprint Scanner Not Responding	"Literally just got this phone yesterday. It's just a Samsung S22+ 128gb. It worked perfectly fine at first, no problems. The battery seemed a bit slow to charge and fast to run out... but then the fingerprint scanner stopped working.
I came here because I've run out of ideas to try. I tried rebooting, deleting my fingerprints (of which now I can't even add anymore because the sensor just... doesn't respond at all), tried turning it on and off again, wiped the cache partition... and zilch. Nothing else has worked. I even tried turning on touch sensitivity. It's not an issue with a screen protector since I didn't have one on when the problem started."	R
Base s22 restarting randomly	Anyone else experienced this? My base s22 vzw running unlocked firmware has been restarting on it's own lately? It has done it once a day for the past three days.

Screen becomes unresponsive during game play	I play call of duty mobile regularly on my s22 ultra and while playing matches the screen will become unresponsive and my game play will stall for a few seconds. There is no lag where things will skip to another point. Everything in game is still active meaning that gameplay around my point of view is happening with no frame drops.Does anybody else have these issues with gameplay on this device? I have tried so many tweaks to cure this problem but it is reoccurring regardless of priority modes and phone setting changes. This is a powerful phone and hope for a fix on this soon enough.	R

Heating	Has anyone had any heating issues at all with s22 series. Some apps I use the top of my phone will get hot. If I restart my device it gets very hot for a few minutes. No warnings have popped up on my phone yet for it. So I don't know if it's normal for it to heat like this or not. The phone has so many apps that use up my ram that I can't get rid of so I'm not sure if that could be why but deffintly wanna know if this happens to anyone else	R
Samsung Galaxy s22 ultra cant find my car's bluetooth signal but my old s10 can.	Hi I received my Samsung Galaxy s22 ultra a few days ago. On the first day it was able to connect to my Toyota Prius's Bluetooth connection. But now on the second day, my s22 ultra cant pick it up. My old Samsung s10 can pick up the Bluetooth connection. I talked to Samsung support and have did a system reboot cleared the cache, restarted my car, restarted my s22 to no avail. I just recently switched my sim card and bought a new sim card but not sure if that has anything to do with it.I am due to drop it off at Best Buy tomorrow but not sure if that will fix it.	R
S22 emoji reactions	I've had a S22 for 2 weeks now. When I first got the phone I had the option of emoji reactions in messages. After a couple days I can no longer emoji react to any messages, the option isn't there any more. I have all the chat features set so I don't understand what happened. Any ideas on how to get the emoji reaction option back?Also, my caller ID doesn't work at all, hasn't since day one. The scam shield and caller ID option are on but when I get calls it does not pop up with the caller info. Anyone know how to fix that? T-Mobile rep at the store couldn't help me.	R
S22 Ultra camera issues	I don't think there's a fix for this outside of a firmware update, but I'll explain what's up anyway.I drive a semi truck. One thing I have to do after every delivery is scan my documents using the camera. On my Note 20 Ultra the process was very smooth and efficient. I'd line up the shot and take it, then move onto the next and everything was great. But on my S22 Ultra when I take the shot (telling it I'm scanning a document) things go a bit south.When I take these photos (often at night) I have some lights on in my truck. These lights generate some shadows. On the old Note 20 the flash would be nice and bright, and flood out those shadows easily. On my new S22 the flash isn't very bright at all and those shadows are very prominent. Also, when I'm taking photos with the S22 there is extreme lag and stutter when I'm lining up my shot, and there's several seconds delay between me taking the photo and the camera finishing saving the image while on the Note 20 it was nearly instant in saving.The real kicker is there's almost no reason for this. Most of the camera hardware is previous generation and Samsung should have the drivers optimized by now since they've had a couple years working with the hardware now.I'm really hoping this gets fixed in an update soon. If not then I may be forced to get another phone as I use it a lot for work.	R

Smart View not working with Samsung tv	I recently got a s22 plus and I'm not able to mirror it to my Samsung 55" TU7000. This worked seamlessly with my note10. When I click smartview, the TV shows up but it just hangs there on "connecting". I've tried going into the smart view app to clear data/cache and have rebooted both devices. Ive also granted smartview all pernissions. Nothing has worked thus far. Any ideas?	R
Something is seriously wrong with the s22 Ultras Night Mode.	The camera in low light does not work properly anymore after April and May Update, and 2nd May update and now the June Update😔(2022). I noticed that when opening the camera app, the camera brings in light for a second, then dims back down. This problem used to be a night mode issue but has expanded to all modes. Night mode shots used to be amazing, but now it is very bad; it brings in virtually no light. After taking a picture from night mode, it does not even do anything; it's like you are using the regular camera without night mode. This issue did NOT occur prior to th April/May 2022 Update. I will screen recording this issue. I also included a comparison between my s10 plus and s22 ultra. The photo that is brighter is the s10 plus, and the darker one is the s22 ultra. Both phones were in the exact same conditions and environment while taking the photos. Something is seriously wrong with the s22 ultras night mode.	R

Unable to make a call	Hey guys wondering if anybody has any idea what's going on here I have a Galaxy s22 ultra on AT&t. For some reason since mid May if I am connected to Wi-Fi and have wifi enabled. Then I go off of the Wi-Fi network onto cellular I cannot make a phone call until I put my phone in airplane mode and then take it out.TThis is a huge problem for me because I have limited reception in my house so I have to be on Wi-Fi calling but then the second I leave my house I can't make Phone calls anymore.ATT&t has replaced the SIM and today even replaced the phone. Immediately after getting the new phone I have the exact same issue. I want to say that this started after the May update but I can't be 100% sure on that.AT&t has suggested I switch networks but that option is greyed out something is clearly happening with the handoff between the phone being on Wi-Fi and then going back to 5G or LTE but what's interesting is that if I'm on an active call it transfers from Wi-Fi to cellular fine. But then again the next time I try to make a call it will immediately disconnect.Anyone have any ideas?	R
Wifi Calling with dual sim	So I have a Galaxy S22 5G with two SIMs (T-Mobile physical, and Telstra eSim).I'm in the US, and want to be able to use Wifi Calling on my Telstra phone (mainly to receive calls and SMS), also while having my T-Mobile SIM active for dataI've found that I can get Wifi Calling / SMS working correctly (both send/receive) on the Telstra SIMonly when I turn off the T-Mobile SIM. Whenever the T-Mobile SIM is enabled, the Wifi Calling/SMS on the Telstra SIM ceases to function (even if I am connected to Wifi). To get it working, I have to disable the T-Mobile SIM and restart.Has anyone encountered similar issues with getting Wifi Calling/SMS working when using dual SIM?	R

Camera Shooting Shaky Video After June Update	"Seemingly since the June update to my snapdragon s22, recording video results in shaky footage from the slightest movement of the phone [shown here](https://linksharing.samsungcloud.com/5fjGz5WHFB5n). 
Does anybody else have this issue? The phone is in perfect condition, no drops or anything. Tested with and without the case on, shooting UHD 60 fps without super steady on.
Watching my older videos, this never happened back then, yet I was using all the same settings.
EDIT: Just tested it on my wifes s22+, same bug."	R
Anyone having this issue with Samsung band selection after newest software update?		R
Here we are again. Pretty sure my 22U SD is just defective	"Update: I reached out to Verizon support, they escalated me to tier 2 support and they're going to replace my device. I'm WAY outside of my 15/30 day standard warranty with Verizon and I don't have device insurance. The support rep's words were ""Upon researching I see that others are experiencing the same issues with this device""
So I've gone round and round, changing settings, disabling apps, factory resetting. Things will be fine for a day and then my battery will tank again. 
I have a Bixby routine that disables essentially everything after dark and puts my phone into power saving mode. 
As a test, I went to sleep at 23% and woke up at 1% 6 hours later. I can't find any reason in the world why my device would drain 22% in 6 hours while it isn't in use. I even had accubattery gathering telemetry for about 3 days and it reports my device SHOULD last for 23 hours, yet I get about 15 in total. Screen on is about 4 hours.
I'm currently on with Verizon support (chat) hoping they will replace my device, but I feel like this one is gonna be on Samsung. I miss my Note 10+ with my 2 day battery life."	R

S22+ stops charging between 30-40%?	"Hello,
In the past 1-2 weeks my S22+ has stopped itself charging between 30-40% and I don't know why. I've used 2 different charging bricks and 2 different charging cables, 1 fast and 1 super fast but they both stop around 30-40%. However when I unplug and put it back on charge it will charge to full.

Moisture detected while charging	"Moisture detected while charging error after installing to June update. Is anyone else having this issue ? My phone now almost 9/10 times says there is something in the port. I have to turn it off to charge most times.
PS I have done factory reset as I had used smart switch. The reset fixed the issue I was having with the battery draining quickly after it got to 10%. It would move up 5% and then turn off. I can now use my phone until the battery indicates it's down to 1%.

Help needed/anecdotes for s22 ultra 4g signal	"Hi everyone. 
Long and short of it is I watch a lot of programs on my phone at work. Previously had the s10+ and upgraded to s22 ultra. But I get a fair bit of buffering now. 
Same sim card, same network and number in the exact same place I'm watching my shows. 
But on the s10+ I had 0 issues..
Case wise. S10+ had a standard rugged case and the s22u has a plastic/silicon case 
It's only been in use for 2 or 3 days, I've checked my carrier and no issues in my area apparently.
Should I send it back? Could an update fix it? Has anyone had a similar comparison they can use? 
Thanks"	R

Hotspot connection lost when the online game starts on desktop computer	I have a new S22 ultra and I have an issue when using hotspot connection with my Desktop.Almost every time I start new online game on my computer, the connection loses and I have to connect again. I mean when the game client is up and I start new game. This ruins my gaming experience. I'm really thinking to change Samsung to some other phone if there is no solution for this. So is there some way to fix this? I never had this kind of problem with other phones.My current solution is to change Sim back to my old Huawei prone and use that for gaming.. I played yesterday several hours without issues with Huawei, so help isneeded.Connection is not metered.	R

Media Output doesn't show all devices	Media Output on the Pixel 6 shows all paired devices, even if they're disconnected. I found this to be very usesful as I frequently use a Bluetooth speaker that I often disconnect from because I'd leave its range. On my S22 Ultra if I try to use Media Output from the locksceen to reconnect, it doesn't even show up as an option. I always have to unlock my phone and use the Bluetooth option in the notification shade instead, which I think is an unnecessary layer that's just inconvenient. Media Output does show other unconnected devices, but never the one I actually want to use and the list doesn't scroll. 	R
Camera issues with dark elements	The other day I noticed that my camera shows weird lines when taking a photo of contrasting colors and light.I was taking photos of some documents while sitting in my car when I noticed the lines appear on the dark places of the photo.

Perhaps a know fix?PS: The documents in the pictures are blurred by me	R
Can't Turn off "Do Not Disturb" and other System UI Persistent notifications	I'm new to Samsung phones, my previous few phones were Google Pixels. On ALL my previous phones I was able to remove persistent notifications like Do Not Disturb.

Video Stabilization is Broken (June Update)	I received the June update a week ago on my snapdragon s22 Ultra. Now since patching, when recording video@ UHD 60FPS with video stabilization on, the footage results in a stuttering and shaky mess. Especially when panning up and down in landscape.I have reset the camera app, cleared the data and cache as well. Opening settings and turning video stabilization off results in footage without the shaking and stuttering. I recreated this bug exactly the same on my wife's s22+, it is bugged exactly the same.Viewing my older videos (that were shot with the same settings) from previous patches shows a perfect video.	R
S22 Ultra unlocked - June update issues	After the June security update that dropped for unlocked s22 ultras today. I can no longer update my app throughs the galaxy store. When I go there and click menu in the lower right. I then see that I have 3 updates. But when I click on dates to see which apps and to actually update, nothing happens.I already cleared cache and data. Force closed the app. Restarted my device. Nothing works. No issue before update.UPDATE:June updated bricked my eSIM. Physical sim works and eSIM does not.Every time I went to make a call it said imei missing. Couldn't update any apps through galaxy store. Signed out of Samsung account and it said imei missing.Ran to ATT store and swapped for physical SIM and everything working again	R
Unlocked S22U won't send sms from esim but will send MMS		R
Mms issues?	"I just got this phone a few days ago and hadn't had too many issues until today. I'm in a group text and the phone won't send or receive MMS messages. Every 5 minutes I have to restart for it to receive and send to catch up in the conversation. I have full service, can use internet. switching back and forth between wifi helps like 25% of the time.
This is ridiculous, anyone else getting issues with this? I think I'm going to send this POS back if there isn't an immediate fix."	R
Wifi calling setting missing after June update (Snapdragon unlocked US)	"Is anyone else utterly unable to find any WiFi calling settings anymore following the June update? I'm on a Verizon MVNO (US Mobile) and had perfectly functional wifi calling before the June update. Loved having my phone in airplane mode to save battery while still getting WiFi calls. Now WiFi calling is gone entirely from my settings.
I've tried clearing the cache and repairing apps, but nothing's changed. Is the setting just gone from all menus now?
Update: according to u/Rider797 it's a problem that US Mobile is working with Verizon to solve."	R
bad reception and phone heating	Just now going on. Cellular is dog shit and my phone is on fire. Anyone else getting the same thing? Just got the June update yesterday. Verizon unlocked s22u	R
when at max volume, the volume lowers.. 😠	So I have had in the past the original Galaxy Continuum phone, Galaxy S 3, Galaxy S5, Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S8, but I took a break after a few years financial reasons I had some LG phones which don't matter to this post exactly. This year I got the Galaxy s22 when it came out. Now when I'm playing my music on max volume after a few minutes it lowers 3 or 4 notches. Kind of like what happens when you're listening to music on max volume with your headphones, so for safety features it lowers to protect your ears. That's what it reminds me of and I can't seem how to fix this because it's just on my phone speaker. When I'm trying to clean or do things that don't require my headphones my volume lowers and it's frustrating. I have never had a problem with other phones. Is anyone else having this issue is there a way to fix it? I like it loud!	R
Anyone else's Google Maps kinda laggy on their Ultra?	"I had this issue with my Galaxy S10 and just switched over to the Ultra, but it's the same issue. It's not laggy enough to interfere with directions and all that. But the interference isn't smooth compared to Iphone, like when I select Directions to a place, it doesn't it laggy. Or when I'm trying to see the next steps in the directions, it's laggy. Even zooming in.
Is anyone else having this issue? I really thought moving to the S22 would fix this issue."	R
Have recent updates helped with battery issues?	"I just got my S22 Ultra yesterday and before ordering it I hadn't read up much on potential issues, I was just excited to get a Note style phone, especially after coming from a 5.8 inch iPhone 11 Pro.
I'm just wondering if the recent updates have helped with overall battery life? I have the 256 GB SD variant and so for I've had my phone off the charger for 4 hours, approx 1 hour of screen on time and a few updates that didn't finish last night and I'm sitting at 85% battery.
This seems pretty great honestly and it's only my first full day having the phone, I know after a time it will optimize to my usage and improve battery life even more.
Anyone who previously had terrible battery issues, has it been better since the recent updates? Or is it more a case of the problem not actually being as wide spread as it seems and it only looks that way because people don't post about things when they don't experience issues."	R
Choppy Video Quality via MMS	Hi everyone, I just recently switched from iOS to Android (iPhone 11 to Galaxy S22+) and realized when sending videos via MMS on either Google messages or Samsung messages the quality of video is absolutely horrendous. Does anyone know a work around that doesn't include sending videos using a third party app? I would prefer to not have to entice all of my friends and family to download a yet another app specifically for the only person with an Andrioid. iMessages had me spoiled and I didn't even think about how 2007 MMS is compared to iOS's iMessage. Thanks in advance.	R
s22 Ultra Snapdragon battery usage	Why does google play services take up more battery than twitter, shopping apps, spotify etc? Is there a way to stop google servies and google apps from draining AS MUCH battery? And is there a way to get gmail real time notifications without the battery drain in the background the same way the reddit app does?	R
[S22] Anyone else get a brightness bug after the latest update?	Since the latest update, after unlocking my phone the brightness is very dim until I manulaly adjust it again. The brightness slider doesnt move, the screen just wakes at nearly the dimmest setting. I do not use adaptive brightness and never have. Anyone else have the same issue?	R
New S22 Ultra, lose mobile data daily	Hi, received my S22 Ultra a few days ago and ran into a seemingly major issue. From ~6pm - 8pm yesterday, and ~5pm - 6pm today, I completely lost mobile data. Each time, I tried multiple restarts, turning mobile data off them on, turning airplane mode on the off, and reset mobile network settings, and nothing resolved it. Each time, it just randomly started working again. During these times I can send and receive calls and SMS texts, and wifi data works. I am on T-Mobile in the US.Any thoughts or similar experiences?Thanks.	R

S22 Ultra Selfie Camera on Snapchat AWFUL	So I logged into snapchat on my old Note 10 to see if it did the same thing, and it doesn't so it's just on my new S22 Ultra. When I take a selfie, the preview looks great, but then when I actually take the photo, it's like super grainy and detailed. Is there a way to change this? I've uninstalled and re-installed snapchat, cleared the cache on both snapchat and the camera app... not sure what else to try?	R
Samsung Account Processing Failed	After June Security Update I am getting Samsung Account Processing Failed Error for Galaxy S22 Ultra.Current Version :- S908U1UEU2AVF1/ S908U1OYM2AVF1/ S908U1UEU2AVF1Security Patch level :- June1, 2022	R

Connecting to Wifi	Im looking for litterally any advice at this point. I just changed over today from an Ipjone to the S22 + as a whole i like it so far. But no matter what i try i can not connect to the wifi. Im trying to connect to my home wifi (XFINITY) for the first time and no matter what troubleshooting i do i end up with connection attempt failed. This is absolutely insane. Any advice what so ever?	R
Wireless Charging Not Working Properly	As stated in the title, I've noticed that wireless charging is not working properly since the June update. I got the update on Tuesday and since then, even with fast wireless charging on, it feels like my phone is trickle charging. Even tried it without a case even though it's never been an issue. I killed off the battery last night to see if maybe some kind of calibration was needed. Ended up falling asleep and over the course of FIVE hours it was only at 54%. I've tried two different chargers as well, one being an OEM Samsung charger. Both are using OEM cables and power bricks as well. Cable charging this morning worked fine and diagnostics says wireless charging is working. It even gives estimated times that look right and normal to what they're used to be, but it's just not accurate. I thought that maybe a rogue app was eating up battery running in the background, but nothing. Done about everything short of a factory reset being that I haven't had the time. Anyone else experiencing something similar?	R
play store app update taking long after June patch	"So since updating to the June latch few days ago, my apps don't seem to update in play store or the update process takes like 20 min to update 3 apps.
The app update stays stuck at PENDING.
I've cleared phone cache and also play store cache but hasn't fixed it so far."	R
Samsung Account Log in Bug	"Bought an unlocked S22 base model direct from Samsung, activated yesterday using eSIM on Tmobile. Used the Samsung Smart Switch app to transfer messages and accounts over from my previous S9 to the S22. Ran a software update. Started getting the pop up to log into my Samsung account. Put in the wrong password 3 times so it locked the account. I reset it using my computer, went to log in on the S22, it then gave the choice to opt into 3 explicitly optional services which I did not check, submitted and then it took me back to the same log in screen. Now when logging in, it doesn't even go to those options anymore. It just shows the brief clockwise animation, no error. Verified could log into the Samsung account on Chrome on the S22, on my laptop. I can log into my Samsung account directly on the S9 which I have not send back yet because I have to remove my microSD and factory reset it before I send it to Samsung for trade in.
I spent 4 hours, with 5-6 Samsung reps. TBH they are pretty worthless. I'm not sure what the magic word is to get transferred to actual tech support. Some of them did not understand when I told them that I chose not to use the nanoSIM from the S9 and instead activated the eSIM in the S22. At one point one of them had spoken to someone else while I was on hold, then told me they informed him this was a known bug they'd addressed in May with the latest software update and that I may have managed to not get that fix so he was transferring me to them to work with me. But, as with every other transfer, the person on the phone was just another low level tech, with no info from the previous rep, running me through the same exact steps with their screen share app. At this point the only thing I'm getting from them is do a factory reset. 
Anyone have experience with this issue?
Also this phone was activated last night and was powered off most of today. Is it bad for the battery to have the phone running a call and this screen share app for basically 4 hours straight on day 2?"	R
opening random apps	Anyone else get this error where I'll press to open my browser but it will open something random like Instagram or Twitter, I'm using s22+ snadragon	R
S22 Ultra Unlocked US - June update broke phone call function DONT UPDATE	"Yesterday i noticed that i stopped getting any incoming calls when my colleague told me he tried to reach me and it went straight to my voicemail. The only recent change on my phone was that i received the June update on Sunday June 26th night. My S22 Ultra is a US unlocked version which was worked fine with calls and 5g data.
Phone would show the signal up to 4 bars but when trying calling from my wife's phone call goes directly to voice mail and the outgoing call would take uoto 15-20 seconds to connect, the locations i am facing this issue at home\\office or outside where it used to work fine before. I also tested the sim in another phone and no issues at all. So i have been trying out different things the internet says since yesterday,
* Restart
* Restart in safe mode
* Network reset
* Airplane mode on\\off
* Do not disturb on/off
* Network mode change from 5G/LTE to LTE/3g
None of them fix the incoming call issue for me, finally before resetting the phone i set the network mode to 3G/2G immediately it fixed the issue with the incoming and outgoing calls.
Definitely June update broke my phone and i think it is something to do with VolLTE or 5G thing or wifi calling, it is pathetic to have a $1200 can't make calls and now i have to live with 3G. I am going to wait for July update to see if it fixes this issue if not i will proceed with reset then warranty claim option if nothing fixes this issue.
I am posting this for anyone who has not performed the June update yet on their unlocked S22 Ultra, Please don't or wait for July update."	R
S22 Ultra Easily breaks!	I've had many phones in the past and i have never had a broken screen until now with the S22 Ultra. Had it a couple of months and out of no where it's cracked in two corners.

Screen flicker on s22 ultra.	My S22 ultra has recently developed a screen flicker on 3/4 of the screen in vertical mode. It does it in horizontal as well. Is this something that can be fixed in settings or is this a warranty issue that may require it to be sent to Samsung for repair?	R
Side Key Double Click doesn't work for Samsung Pay	I see the option to do so on other phones, but not mine.	R
Galaxy S22 Ultra crashing frequently	It's anyone else having multiple phone crashes resulting in a restart in their S22 Ultra? It happens at any time if the day. Doing any activity. Sitting on home screen? Crash. In an app? Crash. In a call? Crash. After a factory reset, it's only occurred 3 times. Prior though, it was happening multiple times daily.I have found nothing online regarding this. Am very close to doing a warranty replacement.	R
Display brightness	S22 Ultra at times the display brightness will dim lower than is set.For instance if display brightness is set at 50% when phone is turned on the brightness would be about 20%.Auto brightness is not turned on either.	R

S22	I have the new s22. I'm seeing issues. The whole having more room for Pictures is a crock. I transferred my stuff from my s8 and my 22 says I don't have anymore room for Pictures,**bleep**. Also the 22 is having trouble deciding what it's going to do when u choose something. Alot of dragging. So where r the benefits and increased technology?????	R
S22U freeze and restart	"I have an S22U (unlocked and TMO sim). Last week, prior to receiving the June update, my phone became unresponsive, then rebooted. Yesterday evening, after receiving the update on Monday, the phone did it again. These are the only two instances I've encountered. Curious as to how widespread this phenomena is. Otherwise, the phone has been magnificent.  
Yes, I've sent error reports to Samsung. No, I do not do any gaming. The only speculation I have is that the phone became hot...not because of usage, but rather because I live and work in north Texas. Yes, I work outside and in a warm truck cab. Fun fact: today we will break the record for number of days above 90 degrees in a year. (and it's not yet July)."	R

What's Up W Battery Life??	So I recently ran battery tests after the June update. Turning on 5G, Wqhd+, 120hz, Bluetooth and sync (location off) I'm looking at around 9-10 h SOT. However turning off sync, cutting back to FHD+ and 60 hz only adds about 2 h/SOT. What the hell?	R

Unlock screen sluggish and always misses a number	"This has been driving me absolutely insane and I can't figure out how to fix it. When I go to my unlock screen to enter my code, it does not seem to be able to always ""keep up"" or recognize my button presses. 
EG. If my code is 1234 it will 70% of the time input 124 and miss the 3. (In my case it's a 5).
If I go slowly, it does it just fine. About 30% of the time it does it just fine.
But 70% of the time me having to re-enter my unlock code is driving me absolutely insane. Anyone have this issue? Any solution?
No screen protector. I've recalibrated touchscreen and turned adaptive display off. Same issue."	R
s22 ultra wifi keeps turning off	"I bought the s22 last week, received it on Monday and I've started having intermittent issues where the phone will turn the wifi off. I turn it back on and it immediately goes off again. I've rebooted, I've tried multiple networks, I reset all network settings and the issue persists. If I run the samsung diagnostic when I can get the wifi to stay on it shows that it's working fine and then immediately turns off again.
Samsung chat was not very helpful. Anyone else experiencing this issue?"	R
Does factory reset help with high heat &amp; frame drops?	Currently using a s22+ for a few months and find it heats up a lot when i watch YouTube in picture-in-picture mode while browsing social media and frame rate dropping on UI. When i set up the phone i used smart switch due to the amount of photos and apps i had. Wondering if factory reset and setting up manually will help with heat/ frame drop issues for those who did factory reset from using smart switch, thanks!	R
Samsung Headphone Adapter launches Assistant when plugged in	Just got a Samsung USB-C to 3.5mm adapter for use in my car and every time I plug it in a get a prompt asking which app I want to use (Bixby, Assistant, etc.) like something is triggering the launcher for voice prompts.

Got the regular s22 a few days ago and it already froze on me	I've been android from the get go but I've fr been considering getting an iphone lately. Then thisbitch freezes opening Google chrome. Ah. I'm pretty sure I can return it but Verizon will charge me extra fees. Maybe next phone....	R
Battery not charging anymore (wired)	"I was wondering if anybody else has been having this problem recently. Whenever I've plugged my S22 Ultra in over the past week (updated it last week), it hasn't been charging. It recognizes the charger and then doesn't, leading it to start and stop charging over and over, not gaining any battery in the process. I know it's not my charging cord, as I've tried multiple other non-Samsung cords, as well as my friend's Samsung cord which charged theirs successfully. 
Haven't tried wireless charging as I've been out of the country without my wireless charging pad, so this is solely with wired charging."	R

Thought I was safe from s22 battery issues	I was so happy when I received my s22 and my battery life was so much better than the reviews. I was easily getting 8 to 9 hours of sot. A few days ago though I noticed the battery was going down every 1 to 3 minutes out of the blue. There was an update so I thought it might fix it and did it. Youtube and streaming I was getting good sot but surfing the web I was getting that insane draining. I decided to do a factory reset and same thing everything BUT browsing the web isfine. It wasn't like that before. I'm so frustrated especially after my s21 that I also have went from great battery life to abysmal after a recent update. The standby drain is 40% overnight. I didn't care so much because my s22 was solid In the battery life department. I also do delete my cache. I would love to know how come a 2 month old phone went from having good battery life to taking a turn for the worst? If samsung doesn't fix these issues I'm going to sell my s21 and s22 and go with another phone company.Is anyone else experiencing anything like this?	R

S22 only works in 3G/2G mode.	"On July 1st my S22 received an update. 10-15 minutes after every restart the S22 works fine. After that I lose signal completely (circle with line instead of bars). 
I put my Tello SIM into a note 8, no issues for the hours I left it there. I can use LTE just fine.
But returning the SIM to my S22, rebooting, and waiting 10 minutes; no signal again. I played with my Network Mode settings as the note 8 isn't 5G and was curious if that might be involved. Randomly my signal (and ability to text/call) returns if I set Network Mode to either 3G/2G (auto connect) OR 3G only OR 2G only. 
This is some advanced shenanigans. In all my years with Samsung and Android, I've never had an update prevent normal operation of a phone. Hope this can help someone else, if they have the same issue."	R

Camera lag issues?	I started taking more pictures with my S22U SD recently and I am starting to notice that there is an immense amount of camera lag, almost to the point that it is unusable. After pressing the shutter button, there is always a longer-than-normal delay before the shot is actually taken, making it difficult to capture moving things. Even if I don't take any pictures, there is frequent stuttering in the camera app when I am just moving the phone around. There is also a problem of overheating when using the camera for more than a few minutes. My friend also has an S22U, but is not experiencing any of these issues. I know that there were many complaints about the camera in the S22 when it first launched, but I had heard that it was patched in later updates. My phone is fully updated, but still experiencing major issues. Is anyone else experiencing this? Do you have any suggestions that could help?	R
Problem with Navigation Bar	I am currently using swipe gestures navigation bar. It was working fine in One ui launcher. Then I decided to use the Nova Launcher.

Same problem. I am currently using one hand operation plus and programmed upward arrows from left or right to see recent apps. But its kind of annoying. Cause I keep trying the old method. And when it doesnt work. I get frustrated and use the upward arrow to see the background running apps. Anyone else having this issue? Is there a way to fix it?	R

Charging	"I could really use some help.
So the issue I'm having is my phone won't do any of the fast charging, my setting are on as well so I know that's not the issue. I dealt with moisture in my port issue for 2 days (no water was in my phone) phone didn't charge for a while, finally got it to work with my wireless charger, and the fast wireless charging works. But fast charging doesn't work with my 45w samsung charger nor any of my 25w chargers. No idea what to do anymore and really don't want to waste my warranty on something if I can fix it. Let me know if anyone has had this issue/fix for the issue. Thank you."	R
Charging and volume issues	"All of a sudden, I am facing 2 issues 
1) For the last 2 and a half wees, charging time increased approximately 50%. I have been using since day one the 2 official Samsung chargers ep t4510 and ep ta845 along with their respective cables. 
Before, charging time from 15% to 100% took approximately 1 hour. Well l, since 2 and a half weeks ago, charging takes 1 and a half hours. 
Please note that the estimated time when I plug the cable always says 58 mins for 100% but I have been using a timer and it actually takes almost half an hour.
This want happening before. The phone charged in one hour.
Both fast charging options have been enabled since day one and the device has all the recent updates. 
2) when I set the volume on max, after some time ( 5 to 10 mins) the volume lowers a bit so I have to press the volume up button to set to max again. This happens constantly. I have to set max volume 10 to 15 times a day.
Any help would be greatly appreciated."	R
S22+ GPS utterly abysmal at tracking my runs	"Hi all, wondering if anyone might have found a solution please.
I use the Nike Running app to track my runs, and whereas my trusty old S8 never had any issues, my new S22+ shows me cutting corners, running over water and through walls. It's a pain because it's losing 200m+ per kilometer so is absolutely useless for tracking pace and distance.
I've disabled every app-specific and system-wide battery saving feature, enabled high precision location, calibrated the compass and used the GPS Status &amp; Toolbox app to reset GPS. I've even tried wiping the cache partition in case that helped.
Has anyone found a fix or an app that works? I'm on the verge of sending the thing back...
Thanks"	R
Galaxy s22 24fps and 30fps issue	"I shot some footage at 30 and 24 fps (in both FHD or UHD with Auto FPS off. The footage plays OK on my phone. However, when copied to a PC and played with Media Player or VLC, it freezes on first frame and sound keeps playing. If loaded tp Premiere Pro or DaVinci, there is no vision at all, but the sound file can be loaded to the timeline and will play (with black screen). Footage shot at 60 fps has no problem.
I set phone to 60 fps and set Auto FPS to on. I shot one clip indoors in moderate light moving into a very low light area. The clip was showed at 36.72 fps. A second clip shot outdoors in daylight showed at 59.90 fps. Both clips worked fine and coud be loaded to the timeline
I tried again at 30 fps with fps on, but no go.
So how do I get the 30 fps footage which works on the phone tp work on the computer???"	R
I may have some serious issue	So.....I have nothing opened in the background and my available ram caps at 3gb.....while my snapdragon 750g redmi has 5gbs free.....optimization issue? Software? Anyone else?(I used AIDA 64 )(Ive checked my ram status because it laggy when i multi task while zoom is live)(S22+ snapdragon variant)(and yes my ram plus aka virtual ram is bumped up to the max 8gb)(Ive already ranned a deep virus scan...nothing popped up)	R
explanation needed for lag	"Been using s22+ since the launch and for some reason my device lags and slows down when I got spigen clear case on and the moment I remove the case its like 10x faster and response time decreases a lot.
The phone doesn't heat up with case so it's not a overheat issue.
Little weird for me, been using Samsung sicne almost 5-6 years with cases on and off, but never felt this happening with any phone.."	R

Contacts' birthdays not showing up in calendar	"I've recently upgraded from an S8 to an S22, importing everything from my old phone.

AoD and possible burn in	"I just turned off the AoD after noticing in the dark on low brightness on a grey background a darker grey circle and darker small area beneath said circle that match up to the AoD fingerprint picture and battery info beneath the fingerprint picture.  Did that really cause a burn in after 2 weeks? 
Also can someone clarify for me how much the AoD clock and fingerprint/battery info moves about the screen?  After I noticed the darker area I realized I never saw the clock in any place other than center.  On an older android phone a couple years ago I remember the AoD clock moving all over the place so I assume on my s22+ that the clock was not moving.  Does it noticably move about or only by a few pixels so I could be mistaken.  Either way it doesn't change the darker areas that match the fingerprint and battery info from the AoD :/"	R
Screen burn in caused by aod!?	"Damnit I thought this wasn't supposed to happen because Samsung aods moved the pixels a little bit once in a while.
I know it was caused by the aod because there's clearly a time and date and notification circles. 
Just for extra precautions to ensure I wouldn't get burn in, I set the aod brightness to the very lowest, although I did have it set to always on.
Is there anyway to fix this other than getting my screen replaced?"	R

s22 ULTRA not charging at 'super fast charging'	"Hey guys, as the title says my phone isn't charging like
it should be. The problem started 2 days ago. I have a

came with the phone. My phone will not charge at 'super
fast charging' it is only limited to cable charging which
takes 2hrs 40min to charge to full from dead. l cleaned
my charging port and made sure that it is not wet or
filled with lint. My tab s7+ charges perfectly fine with
the same charger. l tried soft resseting my phone and

Notifications not working when ringer off	On my S20, I had no problem getting notification sounds when my phone *ringer* was set to mute or vibrate modes. However, this S22 seems to live and die by the phone *ringer*.Is there a way to turn your ringer off but still get notification sounds?

They do not override the way Samsung has the notifications tied to the ringer's status.	R

blown highlights	Hi,Is anyone else experiencing issues with blown highlights in S22? I did a shootout today between S20 and S22. Everything else seems fine or better in S22 except in bright sunlight the images are washed out in S22 while the S20 handles the same sunlight situation with ease. Everything is in the auto mode. S20 has the Auto HDR on while as everyone knows by now S22 does not have the HDR control anymore.

Samsung Internet touch scroll loses position	Scrolling web pages on the Samsung Internet browser loses its position frequently causing the touch position on the page to change vertically without the finger lifting from the screen.This causes frequent mis taps on links since the position of the finger has changed without the user lifting it.To reproduce using one finger touch a wepage that is zoomed larger than the size of the browser viewport.Scroll the page left and right and scroll up and down without lifting the finger.Frequently the scroll position will "jump" usually to a higher position on the page, than the original position.This is a serious usability bug for Samsung Internet.

Galaxy 22 Ultra DND Exceptions broken	Sigh. The latest update by Samsung has rendered my new phone a useless piece of junk. I had my DND set up to allow apps to interrupt. I love to listen to audio apps as i fall asleep. The update the other day broke that. I have it all set up correctly (I didn't change a thing). The dumba** update broke the exceptions. It's set up, but not allowing the apps to override. It absolutely infuriates me. I spent a fortune for this phone and it's broken. Doesn't anyone bother to test things before they push out the update? Come on...test the most obvious things. I am never buying another Android, especially a Samsung. Leave my settings alone and test your work. Do the job. Stop patting yourself on the back for your code and think more.	R

Disappointed with S22 Ultra (Camera, battery)	Hello,I've been trying to find some answers in the previous posts, but it has not really helped much.So I got my S22 Ultra phone 2 weeks ago (had Huawei P30 Pro before) and I thought that now it will be a better camera and battery life...Regarding the camera, yeah pixels and zoom in quality is better, but what is wrong with the colors? How do I get them right? Most of the time I am taking photos of my cat (white and beige with bright blue eyes), and in most of the pictures his white fur turns out blue. Sometimes it is as if some blue watercolor spots were painted on. Never had this issue with Huawei camera. Usually I edit the photos with some simple editing apps on my phone, 1minute editing and I get the results I want, but now because I need to get rid of this blue fur, meanwhile keeping his eye color blue, I will probably need to learn how to edit this kind of photos, find and pay for some more advanced apps (because with the apps I am used to I just can't get them right) and I will spend a lot more time editing them. Is there something wrong with the camera settings or what is it? They look blue on other devices as well, so not the display fault.And what is wrong with battery? Seems to be all the same settings as I had on my Huawei phone, same usage, but need to charge more often.Even though there are some cool features on this phone, overall so far I honestly regret buying this phone and just want to continue using my Huawei. Help?	R
Why My Gallery doesn't play supported Videos	I have a small concern in regards to my gallery setting(s). It's understandable that I can look at photos in my gallery, but oddly my gallery can't seem to play supported Videos. For example. I created a snapchat video, but I had save it to my phone. But as I go into my Gallery, Oddly I can't even watch the video that was created in snapchat... So why can't my gallery play supported third party videos..?	R
Incoming calls no longer showing location call is coming from?	After upgrading from a Galaxy S7 to the S22+ , I am noticing that when an incoming call is coming the initial screen (before I pick up) no longer tells me the location the call is coming from. It only shows the phone number calling. I assumed that the location name was associated with the area code that the number is assigned to. Is that function no longer supported with the newer models? If it makes any difference, I am with Verizon My phone version is 13.1.22.67 and the call version is 13.3.00.16 and the "latest version is installed'. Is there a setting I'm not seeing to be able to do this? I really miss this feature. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.	R

No calls after June update	After installing the June update I was unable to receive calls and could only make calls after waiting 20 seconds for them to connect, and then the quality was awful. I called my carrier who said it was an issue with my phone. Went to Samsung Care. They tested the phone and said there was no connection between the phone and the tower. They said to get a new SIM card. Yeah, right.No one seemed interested that this only happened after the update. Everything was fine before. I remember a very brief pop-up during the installation of the update. Something about the SIM. But it only appeared for a second and I was unable to read it.Long story short, I ended up switching carriers after they suggested I needed a new phone and refused to send a new SIM.My Ultra is five months old!!The same issue was present with the new carrier, though after numerous network resets, the problem corrected itself.Anyone experienced this? It makes me apprehensive about future updates. I felt unsupported by Samsung, especially owning their flagship phone. They saw no causation between the update and the issue. Or were unwilling to admit any.	R

Cannot access lock screen settings	I recently upgraded to an S22 from my S8, using SmartSwitch with the cable.I have no clue why, but I cannot access anything in the lock screen settings.Samsung support via twitter recommended that I:- Soft reset;- Wipe the device cache;- Turn on safe mode;After these didn't work, they recommended that I bring it to a local service center.Why they have to mark each message with their signature is beyond me if they are literally copy and pasting from a script, but whatever.Anyway, nothing worked, and I'm not about to go to a service center just to be able to change the clock face on my lock screen.Device info:Galaxy S22 SM-S901UOneUI 4.1Android 12; May 1, 2022 via Google Play; Security patch June 1, 2022Kernel 5.10.81Build SP1A.210812.016T-Mobile, 2.370001Other relevant info:Email security administrator is enabledPhone is NOT rooted (and samsung makes doing so very difficult)Developer mode enabled; USB debugging enabledI have a strong feeling that the S8 had some feature in the lock screen that the S22 doesn't like, so it refuses to load the entire page. I do not want to reset my settings, or reset my phone. And frankly, this upgrade has been very frustrating, so resetting anything will only make it worse 🙂I would not make this post if I only wanted to change the clock face, however. Currently, I'm missing my beloved notification LED, so I want a way to disable everything the AOD has to offer, just so I can have an app emulate an LED around the camera, with nothing else, and it annoys me greatly that I cannot get into these settings to turn off the clock, fingerprint icon and battery percentageIf anyone has any solutions, I'm all ears[video]	R

S22 Ultra SD 8GB 128 Extreme camera lag (app-- not just shutter). Any hope with July update???	So I took the plunge in May and upgraded my S21 Ultra for the S22 Ultra. With the freebies, and 1k trade-in value, it essentially cost me 35 bucks to upgrade. I was worried about the 8GB of ram (coming from 12 on the S21 Ultra) but figured it probably wouldn't be an issue as my S7+ with 6GB handles Android 12 fine. While it was initially laggy in general (especially compared to my S21 U) the recent updates, and turning off animations have solved that issue. What is suuuuupppper annoying is the camera. I love Samsung's hardware, and their cameras (at least in my opinion) almost always take better photos, overall, when compared to an iphone or Pixel. Their zoom capabilities can't be beat (10x is a game changer for me). What is horrendous is the app lag in the camera. I am not talking about the shutter lag which everyone has complained about for years-- I'm talking about a laggy, janky, app experience. The camera will stutter in photo mode and take forever to switch between len s etc. Even though when it does take a pic they still look great, it creates a worry that it won't be ready to perform when I actually need it to. I've tried everything the great folks have suggested in posts-- cleared cache, factory reset, repaired apps, run optimizer in Good Guardians , tried Samsung Expert Raw app etc. to no avail. Since the rest of the phone seems to run fine, and it just occurs in the camera app (both the stock and the Samsung Expert Raw), I thinking Samsung hasn't tweaked something with the 8GB and the camera. I am on the June 1st update and heard that the new update specifically targets the camera app lag in the 8GB models. Any owners of the 8GB model have the update and can confirm? Otherwise I am reaching out to Samsung to look to do a swap to a 12GB model as this doesn't seem to be an issue for those models. Any insight is appreciated!!!!	R

Problem with group messages	I just upgraded to the S22 Ultra, and my husband got the S22. We share our emails on each other's phones, and I think this caused a problem somehow with our new phones. Whenever I reply to a group message with him in it, it texts the message again as if I'm texting myself. If I try to add him into a group message, it drops him out when I go to write the message. It's as if my phone thinks it's him. It also has us in the same gaming account in Rummikub. He has no issues on his phone, and we had no issues with our S10's. Any ideas on how to fix this? We like having shared email accounts as it syncs our contacts and calendar items. Also useful to search in emails for things we need for our business. ETA: I did just notice that in the advanced settings of text messages, his phone number was listed instead of mine. I changed it to mine, and I can now add him to group texts. But I still text myself.	R

USB Plantronics headset not working for calls on S22+ but works fine on S10+.	I bought an S22+ to upgrade my S10+. For the last 3 years, I've used my Plantronics headset (PLNAUD478) plugged into my S10+'s USB-C port via a USB-A to USB-C adapter.It's worked perfectly for phone and media.Then I bought the S22+. The same setup works for media, but when I make phone calls, I get no audio.I've tried safe mode and factory reset the phone. Nothing fixes it. Tried the bypass audio routing setting in developer options too. Nothing works.Again, this works perfectly on 4 year old S10+.If I don't get this resolved, I'm going to have to send the S22+ back.	R

Songs fading in and it's driving me nuts.	"All of a sudden when I play music via Samsung music the songs briefly fades in for a couple of seconds, its almost like hearing protection for songs with abrupt starts.  The songs don't fade out.  
I've gone into settings and made sure cross fade is off and I can't see any other fade settings.  Even though its not happening when I listen to music on spotify I've turned off cross fade there and its still happening.
It's really annoying as it ruins songs with a loud start and I have combed through the phone settings but cannot find a setting for this.  Has anyone else encountered this problem?"	R
Cell reception issues	"The last couple of months I've been having cell reception issues. The phone shows that there is a network, but the data doesn't work. I cannot send or receive texts. The only thing that fixes the issue is a restart or turning airplane mode on and off. This works maybe 60% of the time. 
Has anyone else had issues with cell reception? If so any fixes or could my unit be going bad?
Also, this usually happens after entering low reception areas. It's like the phone ""forgets"" how to do data."	R
Love My S22 Ultra, Except...	"I've been a Samsung user for over 10 years and I'm very familiar with the Note style phones and Samsung phones in general.
What I love- Pretty much everything.
What I Dislike- The phone takes a long time to power on and Android takes a while to start as well. Unfortunately, Samsung phones and tablets have been this way for quite a while. I hope Samsung figures something out to make the power up time quicker...maybe even have Android start while the phone is powering up (not sure if that's possible)
What I hate- The battery. Yeah, the battery is ok, but not even good, let alone great. 
Of course I have other petty dislikes, but overall I really enjoy my phone for everything it does. The way my phone works for me makes my life a little easier everyday."	R
Keyboard not working	I cannot get the keyboard to appear in any application. Samsung keyboard has no on or off setting. Voice inputs are turned on. Gboard is also on. Gboard is set as the default.	R

"No Internet" message after June update	"After I installed the June 1 update,  I keep getting frequent ""No Internet"" popup messages on the bottom of the phone. I'm not sure yet it they're from the OS itself or Outlook which I always leave open in the background. 
Anyone else seeing this behavior? I should mention that I absolutely have signal, 4 bars of 5G, and this is a dual sim (Visible / AT&amp;T) Galaxy S22 Ultra factory unlocked USA model."	R
No service at home anymore	About 2 weeks ago my phone decided it no longer wanted to work at home. I use t-mobile and until 2 weeks ago I had respectable service at home. Maybe a cell tower near my house was taken out of service. Is it possible I accidentally changed a setting?If anyone has any thoughts I'd love to hear themTy	R

MESSENGER BUG - SEND FAILED	"Hi, I'm using messenger for many years but this is the first time I have encountered a SEND FAILED issue only using my S22 ultra.

touch screen issue	"Hi
I just got my s22 ultra since yesterday and already have an issue on touch screen.
When using my phone a few minutes, a small part at the bottom left of the screen doesnt detect my fingers anymore.. It works very well with spen , its only with fingers. I need to lock and unlock the phone to fix it but few minutes after, its same again.
Ive seen nobody talking about this, so thats maybe only my case.
I tried to understand the issue (save mode, overheat etc) but none of these are the trigger. Its really just for no reason.
Anyone else got this issue and fixed it ? :("	R

Extremely slow internet speeds	"Hello, my s22 ultra has a big connectivity issue. Both wifi and cell service averages about 1mbps with full bars. Resetting the phone fixs the problem for a few minutes and then it goes back to being slow. This happens across all apps and both cell and wifi. It's been an issue since I first received the phone 2 weeks ago.
My old s10 worked flawlessly and was 100x faster. Please help. thanks."	R
Wifi issues brand new S22 Ultra	"Just recieved my brand new S22 Ultra and have had it less than 24 hours. I am having horrible wifi issues. The phone is randomly disconnecting and saying ""waiting for network quality to improve"" while showing a link speed of over 800Mbps. My S21 Ultra which I'm now hesitant to send back for my trade in is connected the whole time and works great on wifi like all my other devices. Slightly farther away (but well within range for all my other devices and old S21) my wifi is dropping and reconnecting constantly causing games like Clash of Clans to be unplayable as you need to reboot the game everytime the network switches. 
I'm using a wifi 6E band. I saw a couple other people post about connection and wifi issues after the last update so I'm curious if the most recent update broke something and it will get fixed? Or if I need to get a refund for this phone and send it back. Wifi not working is certainly a deal breaker for me. 
Cross posting from the Members forum. If your having issues also I would encourage you to post or reply there since I think Samsung pays more attention to that than reddit.

Voicemail messages not showing up in visual voicemail app	I've had many issues with my carrier (AT&amp;T) and voicemail. I'm either getting a "please wait while message is downloaded" on certain messages or now the latest issue - I get the notification of a voicemail, but it doesn't show up in visual voicemail. I did briefly have my line forwarded to Youmail, but it's been unforwarded for a few days now. Carrier did take voicemail off and re add it and I've set it back up again.	R
Strange things happened with my S22 Ultra	"For some reason, tmobile keeps identifying some of my data usages on my phone as hotspot data, when I am using some apps. I never use the hotspot feature, but my 5GB hotspot data is gone just a week from my new cycle started. I cannot even use these apps normally because data becomes significantly slow when I run these apps, I can't even load a regular-size picture in 10 sec. Things get even worse when I connect to VPN, now data becomes slow when I have any activity on my phone, same from both Nord and Express VPN. BTW, I have Magenta, using Esim.
Can anyone tell me what is happening and how can I fix it? Pleaseeeeeeeeeeeee.

Galaxy S22 ultra	I am having issues with it randomly restarting. This is the same reason I upgraded.I have did the online thing about why and how to fix it. The only thing I haven't done is a factory reset.

Wifi is terrible on brand new s22	Just bought it last week, but it keep getting "connected without internet", or the connection is just super slow. I cant watch a youtube video without a buffering every couple minutes, facebook/discord message is hard to send sometimes. Even browsing this samsung community take forever.And no, its not my internet problem, everythingelse like my ipad/laptop work fine.After some research I think people have problem like this with s22 series since 4 months ago. Do that mean samsung cant fix it or its a hardware error?I tried some trick like change to phone mac, dns 1.1.1.1. But nothing work, is there anything else I can do?	R
180 degree rotation not working	My screen is not rotating 180 degrees, which is essential for maps while phone is charging in the car.I can't find a way to turn this back on.

S22 Ultra Photo and Screenshot pics deleted automatically	I have used S22 Ultra for about 2 months.

I only shoot 1080/60 and my screen is set to FHD+. I was thinking that if the ""jittery"" playback has something to do with my settings, transferring it to an iphone/pc would play it smoothly but unfortunately not the case as well. Tried looking for YT vids but can't find any leads"	R

July Update Issues	"This post is regarding problems, bugs, issues that users might/could experience after the July 4th update with the June security patch. 
&amp;#x200B;
**tldr for the tldr:** Samsung account ""Processing Failed"" issue after July update (one fix down below). Other issues and bugs are most likely present after the july update. 
&amp;#x200B;
**tldr:** Samsung services not working due to ""Processing Failed"" Found out Samsung account sync was last working 13 minutes before July Update, googled one last time before losing hope, found out people were having issues with eSIM which I use, tried out the fixed and it worked. Samsung services were back. 
&amp;#x200B;
**The long Story:** I have had no problems with this update until today when I noticed that my Samsung Account services were not working. I noticed this when I was trying to download a game through the Galaxy Store and it wasn't letting me, I checked the updates tab in the Galaxy Store but it wasn't opining either. After a while I checked other Samsung services and clicked on the Samsung Account tab in settings. It only showed ""Processing Failed"" and it didn't let me do anything across many Samsung services. I did many things such as erasing cache, forcing stop, permissions, restarting, research and google, etc. But it did not work. I thought that I had been banned from Samsung Services. However I noticed that Samsung Health did not sync any information since July 4th, 1:07pm, and then I realized that it could be the update. I checked the update info and said that I updated the phone at 1:20pm. At this point I was a bit certain that it WAS the update (more like 60% sure) I tried one last time and googled ""processing failed after july 4 update Samsung"" and I found some support, or blog post in Samsung forums and some people reported eSIM issues and one post even mentioned the processing failed issue and some people said that it got fixed after disabling eSIM, WHICH IS WHAT I USED, ""this is it"" I said, ""it makes sense, july update, eSIM issues, I use eSIM, failed processing issues reported by other users after the update, one person said that it was fixed after disabling eSIM"". Anyways, I disabled and enabled eSIM twice and it was fixed. 
So, there are issues with eSIM, Samsung Services, and Samsung accounts ""Processing Failed"" If you have any issues after the july update, you can share them here and any fixes if you found any.
Edit: a second july update with july security patch got released."	R
Anyone else? - Screen diming after TimeOut sunce last update	"Hey folks. Feels a bit rude to just jump into this sub with a problem, but I've done as much searching as I can and sent those requests to Samsung Members that get ignored, and just seeing if anyone else has the same problem, or some clues for remedying it.    
Since the last system update (I think it was the June update but I got it last week) when my phone goes to screen timeout and I unlock it then it comes back on with the screen super dim. No matter how I have the screen brightness set, or whether adaptive brightness is on or not. I have to pull down the notification tray and I can see that brightness is still set correctly but it won't show correctly until I click on the brightness level as if I am setting a new brightness. If Adaptive is on then holding the phone up to a light doesn't help at all, I have to manually set the brightness for it to fix.    
Anyone else having this issue? It never happened prior to the update, and I can't see anyone reporting online that it's happened to them. The sensor isn't being covered and the phone isn't overheating. I'm stumped. Too add to the confusion - it only happens about 75% of the time, with no obvious pattern."	R

Screen not turning off when listening to Whatsapp audio	"Hello there!
I am having some problems with my phone. I noticed that when I am listening to whatsapp audios the screen do not turn off when I put the phone near my ear.
If I am doing a call via the phone or even via Whatsapp the screen will turn off normally.
I've read in some blogs that the problem could be in the proximity sensor. So, I installed the Samsung Menbers app to do some tests. It seems everything is working fine.
Any ideas?

I've never seen these &lt;key&gt;\_Original tags before. As you can see the original colour primaries were BT 2020 which is correct for HDR but now it's BT 709 which is just HD.Same with the matrix coefficients and transfer characteristics.
It's just very odd. I've also noticed that the video looks more like a conversion to HDR.  So my question is - Is the phone actually capable of recording HDR? 
Just a note that image HDR is different from video HDR . It's done in post processing, and just increases the dynamic range.

Burns in my charging port and cable.	"I woke up in the middle of the night with my phone(extremely hot) beeping saying I had to remove the charging cable (at least something along those, I was obviously sleepy). I didn't give it any thought in the morning and went through my day normally.
Then this evening I tried to charge my S22 and it gives these messages about not charging probably. No big deal I thought let me just unplug and plug in again. Well didn't work....
I Take a look at my charging cable and see these like burn marks on the metal and what looks like oxidized copper at the pins of the charging cable. This is an official samsung cable that I bought less than 2 weeks ago.
The inside of the charging port also has these oxidized copper looking things. My S22 only charges with my old cable but extremy bad.
I don't know what to do I contacted samsung but it will probably take some time."	R
Bluetooth headphone play button stops working after 2-5 minutes	"I just got my Galaxy s22 and went on a trip with it. I'm experiencing a problem with my phone and can't believe I'm the only one dealing with it, but I don't know anyone else who owns this phone.
I have Bluetooth earbuds I like to use to listen to YouTube and music on my phone. Some times, because life happens, I pause my media for over 2 minutes. On my iPhone SE I just switched from, if I hit play on these same Bluetooth headphones my media would play- but on my new galaxy s22, pushing the play button after about 2 minutes does nothing.
I contacted customer support and they had no answer for me. Is this something other people are experiencing? Is there any way to make my phone remember my last used media app? Why own a pair of Bluetooth headphones if Samsung users are forced to open my phone every time I pause my music to hit the play button?"	R
S22 Ultra stuck in download mode.	"Woke up this morning to the phone saying there was a software update. Chose to do it later and shortly after it restarted and went into download mode. When I try to cancel by holding down and power it just restarts in the download mode.

Sporadic missed calls and 5g	Okay. Probably worn out topic. 5G on my S22 Ultra is sporadic. It is not the area I'm in. It happens everywhere. Data would be fine one minute and completely gone the next. Until I reboot the phone. Sometimes I will miss calls and recently I missed an emergency because of this.

"Network Mode option is not there - cannot get 5G	I purchased an S22+ from Samsung. I have had three sim cards installed by Xfinity. All have the same results. No 5G. The "Network Mode" option from which to select 5G is simply missing (not greyed out).I checked with another Android phone while at Xfinity today. He was getting 5G and did have the"Network Mode" option tuned to 5G. So it not an Xfinity issue (as techs at Samsung have told me).

Update slow?	I've had Samsung's for years and have never had any trouble with updates. This one started itself yesterday afternoon and would never stop.

Text message pictures bug	I have the S22+, on Verizon.

It's not until I force close the app and go back in that I can click it and have it maximize the correct file.Anyone else having this issue?	R
Galaxy S22 Ultra Selfie Camera Failure	As soon I received the phone I noticed that the selfie camera keep shutting down and show message that Camera Failure, I thought it will be a software issue as Samsung support team told me when i talked to them on the phone I reset the camera app and the phone itself and uninstalled all the app that doesn't come with it, and a month after contacting with Samsung support team they said its a hardware issue and i received a defective device and must be replaced, two weeks later nothing happened and when i called back they kept me on hold and every time someone else picked the call and have to go back and explained everything from the beginning, i called over 25 times and chat over 10 times with support team 4 months later still having same issues and nothing fixed, don't get Samsung device they have the worst support team ever, i spent over $1200 for this defective device and still have it with no same issue from day one, next time will definitely go with apple. I traded my older iPhone 11 pro max to this device and i regret it.	R

Despite deleting the old card and adding the new one back into the wallet, the old card reappears after a short time and declines on use.I have tried to sync, leave the new card out for days before reentering and nothing seems to work. It also replaces the image of the new credit card with the one I upgraded from.Any ideas?	R
Standby battery drain	Probably a week ago, my phone started to drain a lot of battery overnight. Usually I get only 3%, but now it's easily over 20%. I haven't changed any of my phone settings, and I recently started having WiFi 6 but I suppose this should impact my phone's battery so badly. I don't know what's on, anyone ever experienced this issue?	R
Nearby share stuck at "looking for nearby devices" when attempting to transfer files to PC	I have a Galaxy S22 Ultra with the latest software update. I also have a Dell XPS 8940 PC running Windows 11. I have Nearby Share turned on on both devices and my phone is attached to Bluetooth. When I go to Google Files on my phone and try to Nearby Share a file with my computer, the phone can never "find" my PC, even if I set the computer Bluetooth connection to Recieve a file. The phone gets stuck "Looking for nearby devices."I contacted Samsung chat support; they were clueless, suggesting things that didn't even make sense. Have reset the Network, WiFi, and Bluetooth settings on my phone and Bluetooth on my computer.I've done all the troubleshooting I could find on the internet and have consulted with Microsoft and done all the troubleshooting on Win11. Nothing has helped.I can SEND files to my phone using the Send a file from the Win 11 System Tray Bluetooth icon popup. Goes without a hitch.Anyone else with a Galaxy S22 Ultra finding this problem? Can anyone help?	R

Today I was trying to click on something with my finger and wasn't able to, so I tried the pen and same thing.

Youtube Stuttering issues &amp; more	"Greetings, fellow s22 ultra user. I have a few S22 Ultra-related problems, mostly software-related. Did any of you ever experience these problem?
1- YouTube video player that plays live, regular, and ""shorts"" material stutters every 4-6 seconds.
2-Youtube lags; every time I open a video on YouTube, it begins to lag briefly while the audio is still playing before the video resumes with the audio and video out of sync.
3- Social media can't access the gallery; even though the gallery access is always enabled, whenever I try to send a photo or video via chat or even Instagram stories, it just blank.
And while these problems may easily be resolved by resetting my phone, dealing with them while on the go can be irritating because the first and second problems aren't the same. Is there a cause for the problem, and if so, how can it be fixed? I upgraded my July software."	R

Brightness adjustment not max brightness at max for Netflix.	"Shit title but let me explain.
While watching Netflix, I have the brightness maxed out and when I adjust the brightness slider on the left side, it gets brighter lower down on the slider than it does at max.
Not that it is max anyways.
Anybody dealt with this and have a solution?
Edit: When I adjust the brightness as I go from 0 to 100, it will increase in brightness going up and then randomly hit a bright spot at say 60% and then as I increase from 60%, dim a little before brightening up again. It doesn't throughout. To the point where 80% will be brighter than 100%. (Numbers are just examples)
But even if I leave it at the high point which for example may be 80%, once I play the video, it dims a little."	R

S22 ultra automatic hdr brightness	*adaptive brightness is off*extra brightness is on*video brightness is set to brightThe s22 ultra has an extremely bright displayhowever when playing back hdr content it is extremely disappointing and dim. The only way to fix this is to shine a flashlight at the light sensor of the s22 ultra. When I hit the light sensor with my flashlight the hdr content immediately gets brighter. It seems like with any hdr content autobrightness is on and it wont give you much brightness unless you are in a bright enviroment. This isn't the sunlight overdrive mode, the colors and calibration remains unchanged its just the oled pixel brightness increases. There simply zero need for the brightness to be automatically overriden when playing hdr content. My settings are: extra brightness on, adaptive brightness off, video brightness set to bright and phone is not overheating or charging. Works every time in Netflix or prime video app when playing back hdr. This phone has significantly lower worse hdr brightness than a note 8 severe with burn in due to this bug.	R

URGENT: Phone heating up very hot after running an ADB command!	I was trying to see if I could view intents as they were being done (like doing a certain action and such), I connected my phone to my computer and ran "adb logcat" in the command prompt and after not finding anything useful (it was just outputting a bunch of code very very fast) I then disconnected it. I started to notice it was heating up a bit for some reason and decided to turn it off for a bit, when it cooled down I turned it back on and that's when I noticed it got REALLY hot, which is unusual since it has never done that before after powering it on.What I need to know is if this is caused by the ADB command I ran. Was I suppose to disable it with another command or something, and if so please let me know what it is to disable it (I don't know much about ADB commands). If that's not how ADB commands actually work or something then please also let me know because not sure if this is something where disconnecting it doesn't actually stop it from logging.I really wanna avoid having to take my phone in to get checked since I'm gonna be too busy. I'm using the S22 Ultra by the way and like usual it heats up at the top.Update: I have it super power saving till I can figure this all out which seems to help it stay considerably cool.Update2: It starts to heat back up when I take it off super power saving mode (specifically enabling the limit apps and home screen toggle), I've sent an error report while battery saving mode was off so hopefully they can see what was going on since it was heating up as I was typing the message along with it. I'm starting to think I have to just do a factory reset.Update3: Not sure what fixed it, but now my phone's back to normal, I restarted it once more, accepted the fact that it was just gonna heat up everytime I use it, turned off the screen for awhile, and now it's back to not overheating at all. I'm not sure what was going on with the processor to make it do that, but ya it was getting as hot as if taking a 4k video in the heat. Not sure if it had something to do with greenify or some other app, but I guess it's all fixed now.	R

eSim issues	"So last month's update (June) hosed my eSim. Took me a day and a half to realize I wasn't getting calls. Tried to make a call and fails immediately. Texts and data work fine. I go to ATT, and the first store tries like 10 different eSim cards and nothing. Can't get it activated. Now I got 0 service. Go to a corporate store and they get the eSim activated fine. Still no calls in or out.
I've done the typical cycle airplane mode, reboot etc. But I remembered you can turn a sim off. So I cycle the sim, bam it works. So I've been fine a few weeks. Last night I had to reboot my phone, same issue. Cycle the sim, it works again.
Until I updated to the July patch. My normal trick doesn't work. I contact Samsung support and they want me to drive over an hour to a repair place. So I figure let me try turning off the sim, reboot, turn on the sim. That actually worked! I am however going to be trying to get a regular att sim again. Apparently there's still issues with eSim for Samsung. Since I'm carrying two phones again (the dual sim for texting and calling just blows), I don't *need* the eSim anymore 🤷🏻‍♂️
Just wanted to pass this along for anyone else that might come across this bug!"	R

S22 Ultra screen bug related to resolution?	"So today I got the screen bug with the pink pixels for the first time. I thought that this only happened at the beginning of the phones lifetime with early software but I had my phone since the release and this never happened before.
So the only reason I can thing of that this problem happened only now is that I have turned bixby routine on so that it turns down my resolution while I am outside. 
So my question is: Could this screen problem be related to the resolution?"	R

S22 Ultra Issues	"I am really getting frustated with this phone. I don't know if following issues are happening with only me or anyone else too. I have the 1TB variant. Approx 350Gb is being used , rest empty. 
1. This phone  lags a lot!! My old s10+  felt snappier than this phone. When using it outside in the sun, temperature between 20-27° C, even my settings app lags, forget about the rest of the apps.
2. Video recording lags for 2-3 seconds in the starting and rest it's fine. This happens on all other apps except it's own camera app. 
3. The brightness dude!! It has 1700 nits but f*ck that dude it doesn't work. At the day time, Doesn't matter if its on 30% brightness or 100%, its the same. Gets low below 30% but above that its always the same. I've even turned extra brightness on. But it doesn't always work. Even my old s10+ and my frnd's iphone 11 were more bright in the sun. Now they're making fun of me saying - bro you told us that it has the best brightness ever, my iphone 11 is more brighter than your samsung. 
. 
Note- I am getting these problems since the last 2 months. It was all good until April. I've cleared the cache and can't factory reset the phone as I have to fully backup that data and then put it back in it. It takes a lot of time and I don't have fast cables, faster ssd or a faster laptop to do that. Even the last time it took me like 6 hours to do this. 
There are some other issues, which am not able to remember right now. If anyone can share this to samsung and they can help, please do it. Or I have to move to Iphone 14 lineup. 
Thank you"	R
Android notification that Messenger has switched to data due to loss of Wifi	"I have owned my S22 for a few weeks. What annoys me is the notifications I keep getting from the system, mainly regarding Messenger and Snapchat, that the apps have lost connectivity to Wifi and has therefore swapped to data. (I always have wifi and data on fyi, even at home). Now, that they switched to using data is no issue for me, I have enough data available, but it is still annoying that it does switch. Every time I see the notification, the Wifi signal is still on, and nothing looks wrong at all. It happens a few times per week.

I know how to change it back, but I'm just curious if anyone else has experienced this or knows what could cause it. Pretty sure my phone didn't update last night, since I was able to unlock using biometrics on the first unlock.

I DONT THINK THIS IS NORMAL	"I left my s22 plus snapdragon to download the latest genshin update for like 10-20 minutes, touched it afterwards felt hot af, checked the battery temperature, it was 49 degree Celsius.

Keep losing data signal. Had to RMA.	"I bought my S22U on launch, and it's been working fine until recently. The problem started to appear after the June patch, and Ive since updated to the July patch with a factory reset and the issue remains.
As of late, I keep getting a symbol in my statusbar (circle with diagonal line https://imgur.com/a/j3uibkS), and when that appears, my data connection to my carrier is lost. Even when the icon does not appear, my data signal switches to some random signal, which should be a 5G connection.
To try and remedy this problem, I would remove my SIM card, re-seat it, and place it back into the phone. The signal would get restored, but after a while it would be lost again with the icon reappearing in my statusbar.
I also tried blowing air into the SIM tray port, got a new SIM from carrier, and factory reset my phone three times. None of that fixed the issue.
My phone was never exposed to water, or damaged in any way.
Fortunately I have Samsung Care+, so they're sending me a replacement phone when it becomes available for delivery. Otherwise I would have to send it in for repair, since it's still under warranty. 
I just wanted to post this issue I'm having on this forum in case others are having a similar problem, and if anyone knows more about that icon that keeps appearing in my statusbar. From what I researched it seems to be related to issues with a data connection. If it is data related, I'm hoping to figure out if its a carrier issue or phone issue."	R
Suddenly can't post video on social media	"This is really bizarre...
S22 ultra
I went to a game today and took videos and when I tried uploading them to Instagram story it just shows a completely blurry still frame and sits there. Doesn't play. Then if I still try to continue it pretty quickly does the red warning thing ""can't upload, retry"". 
I thought it was just because of the event and lots of people the bandwidth was terrible, but once I got home to my wifi same problem.
I didn't change any video settings.
I also tried posting older videos that I have successfully uploaded to IG story before and they also do the same thing! So that proves it's not something changing with recordings of new videos.
I started my phone.
I even uninstalled IG and tried again. No dice.
I also tried Snapchat and it doesn't let me open the video there either!
What gives?!
I *think* there was an Android update I applied just recently so maybe that has something to do with it.

🌟s22 ultra google assistant/bixby problems	"My screen and asistant apps do not turn back off after a few seconds after asking google/bixby something. 
Also, when im home, s22 ultra does not recognize after I asked my home mini something, it should cancel the request on s22 after a few seconds and turn the screen back off.  
So I cant use Google assistant on s22 because I have to run into the other room just to turn my screen back off or ask bixby to turn it off. (S7 edge did not have that problem).
Is there a fix for this, or is my device just not working?"	R

Apps not working on Wif	This problem started a few weeks ago. But most of my apps will not work when I'm connected to wifi (any WiFi work home or public). The app would just spin and nothing will load, as soon as I turn off wifi the app would work immediately.I've cleared cache, reset network settings, deleted my wifi networks, nothing works. Other devices on the WiFi works just fine.I've called Samsung tech support, zero help. They seem to think it's an issue with my phone but it's not. Because my wife has the same issue and she has the Note 11. So I think it's probably a recent update. Who knows when they'll fix it.A temporary fix I found is if I turn on my VPN (I use NordVPN) then it works. But as soon as I turn off my VPN it'll stop working.I think I'm done with Samsung phones. This S22 is **bleep**. Got this phone 3 months ago and it's been nothing but issues, everything from fast draining batteries, it's actually slower than my previous s21 Ultra. I think I'm switching to iPhone next. I've been using Samsung for the last 10 years but I'm done. I hate this **bleep**.	R

Late June Update, can't text or receive calls	I woke up one day last month to bad surprise. Usually updates don't have too many negative effects on me but to my surprise I could not send a text. Instead I would get a message saying message blocking was active. I thought maybe I accidentally changed a setting somewhere. Then people were asking why my phone was off.?? Sure enough, all calls were forwarded to voice-mail. After calling my carrier they thought I needed a new sim. Well, since I just recently purchased my s22 ultra I thought maybe it was possible. New sim came and problem stayed the same. Then called Samsung, after hours of Tutor work on the phone they had no answer. I again called my carrier I mentioned the update and the timing of it all. So now here I am 2 weeks later. The problem persist. @Samsung please fix this. I have a sick mother at home who needs to contact me when she calls.	R
Camera lag/bugs	Camera lag is an issue I can't believe has not been solved. Its so frustrating I have to wait half a second or more to take an image because of weird Samsung processing. Many other users on reddit are reportingThen, taking pictures of moving subjects is basically impossible. I find it ridiculous that my iPhone 6S can do this very well, but not my S22+I just wish the camera app didnt become choppy and laggy after snapping a picture. I also wish the camera app took pictures quicker and more reliably, instead of having a huge delay when pressing the shutter button, pnly to have a blurry image.	R

I can't attach a video and text I guess in here (kinda new to reddit) so message me if you wanna see what happens but for chrome- I can't even get passed the sign in with Google or sign in with email page as it doesn't register that I clicked sign in. Samsung browser acts like it's letting me sign in but stays on the loading page between the sign in page and my account page. Thanks for any help in advance!!!	R
Battery life decrease after update?	"I did my security update last month and since then I've noticed my battery life has severely decreased. I used to be able to make a day and a half to 2 days easily without recharging but now I barely make it through 1 day?!

Problem whit Instagram	Hello everyone, I have already searched everywhere and I cannot find the solution, I have problems with Instagram, since it saves the images that I put in my feed and stories, as well as the videos, does anyone know how to prevent this from happening, I already deactivated the "Save Original" option	R

Snapchat camera issue	So I got this phone a few days ago. snapchat was working fine but I woke up this morning, and now upon trying to flip the camera to selfie camera, all it does is change the lens to the wide lens and back. both tapping the flip camera button as well as double tapping the screen result in this. I've tried removing permissions, restarting phone and even reinstalling the app and it doesn't fix it. the camera works fine on other apps. any help?	R

s22 ultra extremely laggy during any type of video and in the viewfinder	"Me and my girlfriend both have an s22 ultra snapdragon 512gb and an s22 snapdragon 256gb with hers being the latter. We both have noticed that in any video situation or video app, the cameras are incredibly laggy. In Snapchat, it's basically unusable video that is recorded as it lags even in the viewfinder before we hit the record button. In the camera app, the viewfinder lags like hell before we even start recording. Even worse, when we go to take pictures, after a few photos, the viewfinder starts lagging and makes it unbearable to take photos. Swapping between the cameras in the viewfinder and during actual video recording is a laggy mess.
I've already updated everything, wiped the cache partition and repaired the apps, I've checked every setting, forced the apps closed, made sure all other apps were closed in the background, made sure the phone was cool and in a room temperature or even cooler environment and nothing worked. 
The only setting that worked was when I changed the video resolution from UHD30 to HD and it didn't lag in the viewfinder for a couple of minutes but then it started again. This is unbearable and unusable. I've already made multiple reports to Samsung members through the bug options but I get a notification 15-60 minutes later telling me that they didn't receive the logs I submitted despite me checking the box to do so. Anyone have a fix or know what's up?"	R

Snapchat no longer switches from front to rear cameras	Help!

Occasionally seeing toast Can't connect to [redacted]. Not trying to connect to anything.	"I keep getting this toast message at random times and it's driving me crazy. As the title says, it displays this exact message: ""Can't connect to [MAC address redacted by Mod]"" It's the same Bluetooth address every time. I've looked it up and the first six digits on a few sites trace back to a company called Shenzhen Bilian Electronic Co., LTD. They make wireless stuff and routers but I don't see any Bluetooth devices on their website. Searching with the remaining half of the address yields nothing more specific. 
I'm not trying manually to connect to any Bluetooth device and I've looked at the Bluetooth device for every device that I've already connected to with this phone and none of them match this one. My house is pretty close to my neighbor's house so it could be a device in their house but I don't understand why my phone would be trying to pair with it.

Intermittent Black Screen of Death + Frozen Apps = GPU/Hardware issue or is this software?	"Happy Friday everyone!
So over the last two weeks of ownership for my S22 Ultra, I've periodically had apps freeze between: Youtube, Snapchat and a couple of mobile games.
Typically the apps themselves will freeze which requires me to relaunch, but I've also had a few occasions where the entire device will lock up to a black screen of death, and I have to do a force reboot (power + volume down) to get it back up.
Haven't been able to tell if the system/OS is also freezing in these instances, as my connected Bluetooth devices (Samsung watch4 and Bluetooth speakers) appear to still be connected.
I also have an intermittent defect for the picture in PICTURE (PIP) functionality for at least YouTube and Google Maps creating an overlay glitch if I quickly move between videos or minimizing to PIP.
More then a little frustrating since I love the phone otherwise. 
I would like to see if anyone else has experienced or found a fix?

Can't Call In or Out - wifi calling?	I am having recurring issues with my S22 Ultra (Verizon) getting where it won't make or receive calls. When I try to call out it will either instantly disconnect or go straight to voicemail, when someone tries to call me it goes straight to voicemail. The issue started after the phone was factory reset last month.What I have figured out:Restarting the phone will fix it temporarily.Turning wifi calling off and back on seems to fix it temporarily. The fix seems to last for approximately a week before it starts again.While it is having the calling issues, I can still send/receive text messages.In my household we have a Samsung Note 10 and a Z Fold 3 that are not having this issue at all (both also on Verizon with same wifi calling settings through them). I have verified that call settings are the same between the devices though they are running different versions of the Phone app. The issue on the S22 has been before and after the last update. (Currently on Phone app version 13.1.22.67; software last updated to S908USQU2AVF7)	R

Fickle Phone Calls	The basic problem is that when we make calls from home the party on the other end will say "I can hear you". Sometimes this occurs after 10 seconds, sometimes after 10 minutes, sometimes not at all. The problem occurs whether WiFi calling is on or off. The same problem also occurs when connecting to the cellular network from home. It started when my wife first started using her cell phone around the house. It was a Samsung S10. I took it for repair and was told it was checked in accordance with Samsung protocols but nothing was found. More recently, my wife and I purchased S22s. The same problem is occurring with both phones. Three phones with the same problem certainly suggests something.I added a WiFi extender and have a strong and fast WiFi signal. It doesn't make a difference. Sometimes when I open the phone app the green call button shows the handset and the WiFi icon and sometimes not. No consistency. Per my cell carrier I have replaced the SIM cards. Per Samsung I have done a network reset. Still have the problem! Advice would be greatly appreciated. It's tough to have a cell phone that is great otherwise, but is not reliable in making phone calls.	R
S22 Ultra no network, gets hot, makes me afraid	The S22 Ultra that I received on the release date is absolute garbage. It will not hold a connection to any cell tower, and without wifi...it's useless for anything data related.The phone gets extremely hot, and makes me fear it will explode.The warranty process is 7+ days without a phone.It's starting to feel like a giant scam.

Laggy UI AND app crashes using Navigation Gestures	I am a galaxy user from the past year and half.

Android Auto in-call quality	"Has anyone noticed poor audio quality for in-calls when using Android Auto? The audio sounds muffled, like old 2G quality.

It's about AA via USB using Samsung original USBA to USBC cable.
Music seems fine, but call quality is terrible."	R
distorted audio after July update	So I recently started noticing that any audio from the phone is distored and the speakers sound blown out after the update.

Camera app consistently crashes when left open for more than a few seconds.	If I leave the app open, like waiting for something to happen and don't interact with it, it seems like it will crash almost all the time. It doesn't freeze, it just closes entirely. It is not a set amount of time that it takes for this to happen. Thought it does seem like it will stay open longer with each successive reopening of the app. So the first time I open it, it will probably crash in 10 seconds to 2 minutes, but the next time it will stay open for longer before it crashes. Any idea what causes this or how to fix it? Not sure if I am the only one that has this issue or not. I didn't even notice it was an issue until recently since it only occurs when you leave the app open for extended periods. Usually I just point and shoot.	R

s22+ has same issues as s20+ after smart switch	"Hi I'm new to this page.
I recently got a brand new s22+ and used samasungs smart switch to transfer everything from my s20+. It seemed like it went smoothly except now I'm noticing the s22+ has all the exact same little bugs and issues that the old phone had. For example, sometimes the alarm will sound in the morning but won't show up on the screen so there's no way to shut it off, Spotify likes to freeze and randomly pause, I sometimes have issues with FB and Instagram as well. Has anyone experiences this before?
None of this is serious stuff but I just feel like a brand new $1000 phone should run smooth and fast. The whole reason I decided to get a new galaxy was bc the old one was starting to have these issues.
I'm wondering if I should just reset the phone and then manually install all my apps and back up everything else like pictures etc. to Google drive instead of taking up space on the new phone. 
Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks guys!"	R

S22 Wifi drops connection on 5g WIFI 6	"I am on the June update and ever since I installed a wifi 6 AP from zyxel my S22 drops the wifi connection every few minutes. It either stays connected with about 2mbits or says connected no internet (with the exclamation on wifi symbol)
I tested this behavior on S21, ASUS ROG flow x13 and Intel WIFI Ax200 (PC). All of them are wifi 6 compatible and have no issues connecting.
My 5ghz and 2ghz bands are separate SSIDs, channels are checked and selected to free channels. AP is connected by LAN to router.
This issue doesn't seem to be that uncommon though, it's probably a QS issue or hardware/firmware related...
Should I contact Samsung? Do they offer replacements that are sent before I send mine back? Because I only have one phone atm and I can't reset it without another phone since there's multiple 2FA accounts etc that I would need to transfer first.
Just as an FYI, I work as an IT specialist and I checked everything so far. This issue is not caused by me or my network configuration!"	R

In order to initiate they want me to send in my phone. This is the opposite of what I requestI decide, fine, I’ll send it in. I need this issue fixed, and they’ve said they’ll send me a replacement. I factory reset the phone and send it off. I’m worried though that they won’t be able to replicate the issue considering they won’t be using my accountA few days later I get a text message:A Samsung Certified Pro has performed a complete inspection and diagnostic testing on your device to attempt to duplicate the issue that you described on your ticket #######. However, we were not able to duplicate the issue on our end. For this reason, we would like to speak with you and gather more details to provide better service. Please answer "yes" if it is ok for us to call you to discuss this within 1~2 hours. 1-800-726-7864 In case of non-response, your device will be marked as No Trouble Found, and shipped back to you within the next business day.Call 10I call the number. The rep has no idea what I’m talking about and says the phone is still in the assessed state. I read the text message to them. They don’t know and transfer me. Next rep doesn’t know either, transfers me to a 3rd department at which point the call drops.Issue resolved: NoCall 11I call back and am given a new number to callIssue resolved: NoCall 12I call the new number explain the situation again. I’m transferred to the repair department.I explain to the repair department representative that it’s very important that the phone isn’t sent back to me.

She says she’s notating the account and will make sure that happensThat night I get an email the review of my phone is complete, nothings wrong THEY'RE SENDING IT BACK TO ME.Issue resolved: NoCall 13I’m told the phone has shipped back. They can’t do anything I’ll need to contact the repair department when they open. I ask how to contact the repair department. They say I can’t. I’ll need to call 1-800-samsung. I ask what they can see on my account. Can they see I’ve called at least 10 times? Are there notes? Do they know why the phone is in the repair department? Answer: NoMultiple steps along the way I’ve asked for help from someone who can get me out of this loop. I’ve asked for a manager. I’ve asked for a developer. I’ve asked for someone who can take an account level perspective and just help me get this resolved.Call 14 (I wish I had recorded this call)I talk to a rep who is willing to escalate to a manager. I tell the manager the whole story. She says there’s nothing they can do. Samsung will need TWO service tickets in order to allow replacement or refund. My phone is on its way back to me and I need to test it. I ask if the phone has been “repaired” because it says it wasn’t defective on the text message I got. She said no it was not repaired. I ask how will this be different? I’m receiving the exact device I was sent without anything being done to it. She says that’s our policy. We go around in circles for about an hour.I finally ask if I can get in writing from her that if I send it in again and it doesn’t work they’ll refund me or exchange the S22. She puts me on hold for 10 minutes, comes back and says actually “NO”, they won’t refund or replace even if it doesn’t work this time. I ask for a feedback department, or an escalation team, or someone that can review this since there’s a weird software hardware combination issue. I’m told there’s no one else I can talk to.At about 2 hours in I have to go to a meeting, I ask if this manager can help me get this resolved. If I can contact her directly when I receive my non-working phone back. She says No, there’s no way to contact her. Eventually she does give me a phone number I can text.Issue Resolved: NoA day later I receive the phone back. Open it. Go through the forever long process of adding my accounts. Test it. And you guessed it, STILL BROKEN.I text the number she gave me with screen captures of the issue. 24 hours passes, no response.Chat support:I start a chat support request. I’m told yes they can help me. I can buy a new S22 and the order department will help me get my old S22 refunded. I’m thinking this sounds good, but I don’t trust that IT will happen. I ask to refund the current phone first.Issue Resolved: NoTranscript LinkThe Chat agent says I need to talk to the “orders support department” gives me a number to call: 855-726-8721.Transcript LinkCall 15: Orders Support DepartmentI call, go through a few prompts, the phone proceeds to ring for about 5 minutes, no one answers.Issue Resolved: NoThe previous chat agent also gave me the “chat” support for the orders department. I start a chat with them. They eventually tell me “No we can’t do that, you need to talk to the service department” and give me this number to call: 844-726-7297Issue Resolved: NoCall 16Turns out this is the department for Samsung Pay Support. They can’t help me but give me another number to call: 855-795-0509.This number is for Samsung general app support. This is where I started in MarchIssue Resolved: NoCall 17App support department. Sorry we can’t help you, but we’ll transfer you over to the service department.Service department: “we can’t do anything, you need the repair department”Me: “I’ve done this loop before”Service department transfers me to repair departmentRepair department “You have to send your phone back in to us. We have to try and repair it THREE times in order to authorize a replacement.”Me: “but you won’t find the issue because you didn’t find it before, and you need my account on the phone to find the issue. Is there anyone I can explain this to?”Service department: “send your screenshots to: pop@sea.samsung.com. We’ll create a new service ticket for you to send your phone in again.”Issue resolved: NoTodayI’m really unsure of what to do. I’ve been in touch with Samsung within a month from receiving the device, I initially trusted they’d help me fix it, but so far they can’t/won’t. I don't want to send my phone in again only to have them send it right back.I’ve been a big android enthusiast. Was a huge nexus fan but switched over to Samsung with the S7. Looking back at my purchase history I’ve purchased the following for either myself or my wife in the last few years directly from SamsungPhones:-Galaxy S8 (x2)-Galaxy S20-Galaxy S20 FE (x2)-Galaxy S21(x2)-Galaxy S22Watches:-Galaxy Fit-Galaxy watch active2 (x2)-Galaxy watch 4 (x2)Earbuds:-Galaxy Buds+ (x2)-Galaxy Buds Pro (x2)-Galaxy Buds LiveFrom an LTV perspective I essentially buy the new Galaxy S device from Samsung every year (sometimes multiple). I would think swapping out my non-working S22 would be pretty simple to keep me on the train.I haven’t had this issue on any of my previous Samsung Phones, so it seems like something is going on with this S22. I can’t find out for sure though since they won’t send me a replacement S22.I guess at this point I cut my losses. Buy a Pixel 6 maybe?Has anyone had a similar experience? Was there a department you were able to reach that could help you get out of this **bleep** loop?	R

Ignored DND Exception	"On my S22 Ultra, I have set my DND to be 11 pm - 6 am.  I also have setup exceptions for calls and messages as 'Favorite contacts only'.  However, it never seems to work.  I constantly don't get the text message alerts until after the DND expires.  For example, this morning, one of my favorite contacts sent me a text at 5:35 am.  I didn't receive the notification until 6 am when the DND turned off. 
This is on the Google Messages app since that's the default messaging app for the S22U.  Anyone else experience this and how did you fix?"	R

Suddenly horrible bluetooth call quality in car	"I'm at a loss on this one. Before last week, phone calls sounded perfectly fine in my 2016 carolla.

My phone is not on airplane mode, I have restarted it, I have full bars and wifi and no outages in my area.

Galaxy S22 acting different after opening a link on a spam text. How to proceed?	Hello 👋Can anyone help me?So I just received a text saying that I had a TV shipped to my address, it just sayed adress, and I clicked on the link to keep track of the item. So I clicked on it and notice that it was a scam, because it had 30sec to redirect me to another page. So what I did was close the tab and cleared my history. Ever since this happened my device has been acting a bit strange. For example, yesterday I recied a notification from my social media and my device was unlocked without me entering my password. I probably scanned my fp to unlock my device but I saw the notification pop up and unlocked my phone before I could grab it. Can the hacker hack my device?	R

Music starts playing randomly	Very frustrated. I just received my new S22+ 2 days ago, replacing an S21+ early due to a software push. The S21+ started to have phone call call audio cut out every 30 seconds for 3 after the early July 2022 software update. You know the drill...samsung says verizon, verzion says Samsung.On the second night with my S22+ at 9PM a random song started playing...instrumental only. I see others on internet search have same problem and heard same song. I had to power the phone off to stop it. It happened again this morning at 8AM EST.Similar issues? Resolution.VERY FRUSTRATED! Been a samsung user since my first flip phone. S21+ and now S22+ are the only issues I every had	R

Fitbit Versa 2 not syncing with S22	Hi. I have just switched over from S7 to S22. I cannot get my fitbit versa 2 to sync with new phone.I have restarted both devices multiple times.

Camera is laggy as FUCK. Terrible processing and blurry 10x	"So I've been loving this phone since the july update because it finally felt buttery smooth. Camera was also working fantastically. But since the past week camera experience has been horrible for a flagship. Before anyone says anything i tried clearing cache and data and my lenses are all clean and haven't dropped the phone either. Reported to samsung who just came up with shitty excuses 
- I've always taken photos in a moving car just fine and even 10x photos would usually look crisp and not have motion blur. Fast shutter too. Now its a hit or miss because the shutter is so slow it was taking 1x 0.5-1 second to take a photo eventho it wasn't low light. My A30 wasn't even this slow. Same goes for zoom lenses. 
- The photo processing is just inconsistent and bad now. Colors, noise, sharpness are inconsistent. I was taking photos of clouds with the same exposure and one picture had tons of grain while the other looked more cleaned up. Usually happens with blue hour and sunset skies but have seen it happen in daylight with zoom. 
- The 10x lens is just awful now. I'm not sure if its the ois or the processing or both. Video seems fine and stable ig but if i try holding my hands still there is still jitter with 10x. But the stabilization is mostly a problem in photo mode and pro mode. The other lenses are noticeably more stable even zoomed in and im certain the 10x wasn't this shaky because i have somewhat shaky hands and I've never had problems with 10x stabilization before. Now it feels like low light at 10x is almost impossible and even if i keep my hands still daylight shots can have some shake to them. 
- Taking photos of indoor items is pointless because the main 10x always looks blurry even with all the lights on. I've taken pictures in my room with all lenses before in the same lighting and never noticed an issue. Surprisingly expert raw 10x is shaky yes but still looks clear and same goes for pro mode. Meanwhile regular 10x looks fine in the viewfinder and taking a screenshot is better than taking an actual picture. Even 3x zoomed in to 9.8x looks better than 10x.
- Idk if this was always there but there's this weird color shift from 3x to 10x where 10x has this almost hazy ish look to it with a slight green tint whereas 3x looks more saturated and contrasty. As far as i remember the 2 zoom lenses looked almost identical with 1x being a bit less saturated. Its not just the picture tho the actual viewfinder on 3x looks more saturated and contrasty and 10x looks hazy.
Forgot to add-  i have snapdragon variant"	R
Camera glitches with post processing - weird orange/yellow tones, color burn / bleeding etc	"Glitched photos: [https://imgur.com/a/vcUImbA](https://imgur.com/a/vcUImbA)
Normal photo: [https://i.imgur.com/mVkoXNE.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/mVkoXNE.jpg)
The above photos haven't been edited at all and are straight from the front camera. I literally held the phone as still as I could and mashed the shutter button a few times so they were all taken within a few seconds of each other. The photos that are glitching out - take a look where the heart lighting is and the light strip vs the one that looks fine. And the skin - theres weird yellow /orange being added.
I've just recently purchased the s22 ultra &amp; have noticed some really crazy things happening with the front camera.
I'm having issues with skintones being overly yellow (I am pale white and just moved from the pixel 6 which captured me properly). Usually if a photo is just too yellow I'd correct the white balance but this is adding unfixable yellow tones to my skin only.
Adding onto the first issue, it will also sometimes BURN the yellow tones almost as if you've put the wrong shade of makeup on but then sloppily applied it down your neck in some areas, and blotched it over your body too. This was happening in photos where I was wearing NO makeup and looked like I had weird discoloration all over me.
There was even one photo that made my whole face look super brown and I really don't understand how or why this happened, the issue below also happened in that photo.
Secondly, I noticed this when shooting with RGB light strips or nanoleafs behind me (never had issues with this with the pixel 6 or 5) it would BLEED the strips out as if you've turned up the saturation just in that area to 100000. I'll take the photo and it will look fine but then I will WATCH it add all this weird post processing and ruin a photo completely
I cannot for the life of me understand what is going on but the only thing I can think of is auto hdr? But the option to turn this off is nowhere to be seen. Its almost like its doing weird things with exposure and saturation and additionally contrast"	R
Messages app	Intermittently the messages app shows the wrong time stamp on an incoming message on my Galaxy s22. For instance my daughter texted me at 9.51am this morning but the text read 9.32pm. therefore it puts the text in the wrong order in the thread. This usually doesn't happen often, but it has occurred 3 times in the last 2 weeks, so more annoying than usual. It says I have the most current version of messages. And phone has all updates. I'm thinking that it has to be the Samsung app because I've used the Google messages app prior and it's only happened in the Samsung app. And I've had the same problem in prior Galaxy phones also.	R

Service/ Some Group messages require download from sender.	The Samsung support service is terrible. Can't get all group MMS messages on my new S22. Starting happening last week.

Aux adapter not playing audio through headphones	Whenever I try to use a pair of wired headphones with my aux adapter on my S22 ultra, it won't play the music on the headphones, and will send me a notification saying "Charging connected device via USB" and will also send me a notification saying that a "USB device is connected" and then saying "USB device is disconnected" and will flick back and forth between connected and disconnected.

3rd party Password manager Doesn't work properly	Hi. I just got an S22+ and I'm trying to use Bitwarden but it's just not working properly, it seems that it's not detecting the username/email addresses as fillable forms. For password fields sometimes it does and sometimes not, but for usernames it never does on apps and websites. I tried to use all four methods mentioned in Bitwarden to no avail. I've been using Bitwarden on my S9+ without any issues at all. I also tried 1Password on S22+ and it has the exact same issues so I'm sure it has something to do with the phone. I'm seriously considering returning the phones because this is so important to me. Anyone can help please?	R
The zoom camera is incredibly laggy ever since I got this phone	Does anyone else have this problem? I pre ordered the phone and have had it for 4 months now. Ever since I got it there is an an incredible amount of lag using the zoom camera for photos especially in the portrait mode.The preview gets really stuttery and a picture can take a few seconds to be taken after I press the shutter button. The zoom camera is my personally favorite camera to use for portraits especially coming from a phone with no zoom camera. The pictures come out amazing but sometimes it's embarrassing showing the camera app to my iPhone friends because it's so **bleep** laggy to use.It's the s22+	R

Apps Not Working	I just got a new Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, got connected to the internet, updated everything and almost none of my apps work. Disney+, ESPN, Hulu, Twitch, Apple Music, even The Weather Channel.Everything opens, but once the splash screen comes up, I either get a "connection error", the app won't load past login, or it just straight up gets stuck on the splash screen without moving.It's not an internet issue, I speed test my internet connection with the same phone, and I get 300+ download, and I can run certain apps like YouTube or Reddit with zero connectivity issues. I can watch a YouTube video at full quality immediately, then go straight to Hulu/Disney/ESPN/Twitch/Apple and literally can't get past login.I've tried factory reset, clearing cache, deleted/downloaded them all multiple times, phone resets, everything.Also want to add, if I go into airplane mode with the app open, it gets past the splash screen, and then I can go out of airplane mode and it let's me login. But if I go straight to an app while on wifi, I get stuck on splash screen. It makes zero sense.	R

Artifact in camera app that saves to photos, anyone else??	"Hey, so I noticed on my s22 ultra that when I have the camera app up if I zoom between 3x-10x there is a small artifact inside the camera photos. If I go under 3x or over 10x is immediately disappears which makes me think this is a software thing. It stays constant with the moving of the camera and will only go away if I do like mentioned above. It saves to the photos zoom in or out like mentioned above.

S22 Ultra - USB Headphones not working	Have had a S22 Ultra for about a month or so. My husband also got the same model, different color. I have a wired headset from palovue which works great for listening to audio & phone calls WHEN i am doing wifi calling. However, if i turn wifi off or wifi drops for whatever reason, the call goes silent. The call does not drop. I am able to turn on speaker phone and the person i am on the phone with can only then hear me & i hear them.to test this, i made multiple phone calls with my phone & my husband's phone. the same behavior was observed on both devices, despite using different providers.if the phone is in airplane mode with wifi turned on after going into airplane mode, call audio in the headphones works just fine.however, if i call using my mobile network (turn wifi off to test and get out of airplane mode), there is no ringback audio nor when the person picks up is there any audio from them. toggling speakerphone reveals there is nothing wrong with the call.Listening to audio such as spotify or youtube on the mobile network with the wired headset is fine. no issues. it is ONLY when on calls using the mobile network that the S22 Ultra consistently loses audio functionality with the wired headset.	R
Why my phone so slow compared to the other s22ultra it has the snapdragon	The phone is on the latest software update and is really annoying how slow it is should I ask Samsung to replace it for me .quick edit my note 20 was faster ( preforming )	R
No texts outgoing, not receiving calls	If you have not been able to send texts (message block active) or receive calls (forwarded straight to voice-mail) I may have found the solution.There is a setting that choices the best network for your phone. Put that on and drop from 5g to 3g ON TMOBILE TOWERS.This has gotten .you phone to at least preform these basic tasks until an update is released to fix it.	R

I rebooted, but it's still not working.3. Minor one! My spam list long ago filled up on my old phone. (Only 500? That's like a week's worth!) I was surprised to see it didn't start from zero on the new phone.TIA!	R

Calls/SMS not working after june 2022 update	I'm not sure why these threads all keep getting deleted or merged into threads that ARE NOT THE SAME ISSUE.The June 2022 upgrade broke the ability for many samsung phones to receive calls or send SMS messages. This dude is tracking the issue:https://piunikaweb.com/2022/07/21/samsung-galaxy-s21-users-not-receiving-calls-or-texts-after-june-u...So far I've posted on this forum and had my posts deleted/archivedI've spoken extensively with my carrier who said it was a known samsung issue after being escalated past tier 2 support.I've spoken with multiple samsung reps. One told me I needed to take it up with my carrier, the other told me it was a known issue and to take it to a local repair shop for assistance.I called two local certified samsung repair shops who had no idea what I was talking about.Is there nothing we can do to get an official reply on this?

Android Auto not connecting - connection is not recognized	I have a S22 Ultra phone with the latest software updates installed (both for system and Android Auto). I've tried to connect with several data cables, both an original Samsung and also with alternate brands.The issue is that the phone automatically selects cable charging and the Android Auto doesn't recognize any connection to the car. I tried to turn ot the developer mode and set the default method to File transfer. Still nothing. The car works fine with other devices, so the USB plug is probably not the issue, as well.I'm out of ideas. Maybe complete reset of the phone?Any help is well appriciated.Thanks!	R

Galaxy S22 Ultra muffled voicechat	Hello there!I just bought the S22 Ultra and so far I'm very happy with it.I just have one problem!I voicechat a lot from the samsung message app, you know, where you have to hold down the button to record your voice and it will send as an mms.On my old phone (Sony Xperia 5) the quality from recieved voicechats were crisp from my girlfriends phone (S21 Ultra).Now it sounds muffled and so does the voicerecording I send to her.I don't understand why that is.The mic on the S22 Ultra sounds awesome when I video record but for some reason it gets muffled when trying to voicechat. So that leads me to believe that the Samsung message app compresses the file to lowest file size possible and in turn lower the quality of the recording. I tried with different apps and Snapchat is the only one that it sounds somewhat okay on.Can anyone confirm or deny this?If denied can someone come up with a solution to why it sounds muffled with voicechat but sounds super crisp and clean from video recording?

S22 Ultra Wi-fi issues	Hello I want to report that wifi connection to my Samsung S22 ultra is often connected to wifi but displaying msg that is connected but without internet. It is more frequent with 5Ghz wifi networks compared with 2.4GhzWhen I disconnect and re-connect all is good for some time but then it happens all over again.My internet infrastructure is working 100% and no misconfiguration is occurring on my end. As this happens to me also on work I assume that it is something Samsung related.Thank you!	R
S22 Plus keeps reverting to 3G / H+........	Hello all, this is my first post here. I have an S22 Plus, unlocked from Samsung. I'm on T-Mobile USA service.I recently installed the July 1 security patch update. Since then, my phone keeps reverting to 3G speeds. It occurs as the following. If my phone has been sitting for an hour, I pick it up, and it shows 3G or H+. I will run an internet speed test, and get around 5 mbps. I switch to airplane mode for 10 seconds, and then switch airplane mode off. Immediately, I'm back on 5G and speeds are 300 mbps.30 minutes later, my phone is back on 3G again. If I toggle airplane mode on and off, I'm right back to 5G. Has anyone else experienced this? Since the July update, my battery life has also degraded. I'm guessing this is due to the weak signal, and my phone is constantly searching.Any help is greatly appreciated.	R
Individual app notifications missing	I know with the new Samsung phones, you have to manually change your app notifications by going into each app, otherwise the phone sets all your notifications to your default sound. However, it seems that when I try to do this, there are NO sounds to choose from for that app. For example: if I go into the Snapchat app, the Snapchat notification sound isn't listed in the notification sounds to choose from. It's like that with all my apps. Games, Messenger, etc. Why is it automatically replacing app sounds with the default sound and why does it not have those app sounds to choose from in the list? Please help!	R
Offline/online pop up message	My phone keeps popping up that, you are now offline, or your internet connection has been restored message. I don't care if I'm offline or not, as messages get sent automatically when connection is restored, but the message location blocks part of the keyboard and I'm left unable to continue typing until it's gone. Please make the message appear at the top of the screen instead of the bottom, or just go back to the no signal icon. It's far more inconvenient now than it is to just send a message without signal and get the message saying it will be sent when signal is restored. I can get the no internet/internet restored message two or three times in one text message, which basically triples my text time each time it occurs. Longer if I keep trying to type while the message is up, because the timer to let it disappear doesn't seem to start until I stop touching the screen entirely.If I didn't use this forum correctly, please tell me where to put this to get a solution. It's going to need to be implemented in a backend update at some point, if anyone cares enough at all to actually fix it.	R

Dead Pixels	"&amp;#x200B;
[These are what I assume are dead pixels. They stay on the same spot of the screen even when screen rotates. They are perfectly round black spots, one is a large black dot and there are smaller ones as well, all perfect black circles. Not sure if these are dead pixels or not. I haven't seen anyone else with a similar issue. Most dead pixels I see are multicolored or people have lines across their screens, not perfect little black circles like mine.](https://preview.redd.it/dz7nk990z3e91.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d45cca521af4b6f7480e3e5e19fac61b166b05da)
I've tried everything to fix this, there are even apps for stuck pixels but those do nothing. Has anyone else had or even seen this issue? Also from what I can tell if I want to get a replacement then I will have to send in my phone and wait for a new one to be returned which will be weeks. I don't have a spare phone to hold me over while I wait for the new one. And I have shitty Sprint which is still in limbo and hasn't been fully moved over to T mobile so I can't go into a store and get a replacement either!"	R

Notification Sounds not Changing	Greetings all... I've searched the threads here quite extensively and I do not believe my issue has been addressed.So, I understand to go into apps> click on the app whose notification sound i want to change> click other notifications> pick the sounds.

I have so many different stupid apps for different things and I like being able to tell by the sound which app is alerting me (is it the team GroupMe? Is it the girl child's teacher?

Horrible Camera Lag	"Hi all
I'm seeing this on my 128GB S22 Ultra these days, and it hasn't gotten any better after the July update. I recall that it used to be really smooth to take photos on my Note 20U but this phone has some serious problems - it lags whenever I open camera and the shutter button response is quite bad. If I switch modes it takes forever and the device is basically a brick for as long as the camera app is open. I wonder wtf is going on. Are you guys having the same problem? How do we fix it?"	R

There is no email received but a notification pops like a new receipt mail, however, i realize it is an item from 2-3 days ago.
Microsoft said delete outlook and reinstall like they always do.
So anybody who has been having this issue or has a solution?

Camera is over exposing by default	My S22 Ultra main photo mode is over exposing. This has been the case from the beginning (purchased my phone in March) and I hoped then some future update would fix this.A main photo mode over compendates and results are usually blown out highlights, washout blacks and lost details. This is why I usually end shooting RAW to ensure that I don't ruin my photos. Over exposing happens mainly when there is sky in picture or bright highlights.One thing I'm also missing is exposure adjustment slider in a main photo mode. I use to have this in my old OnePlus 🙂 It was neat and fast option.Have I missed some setups or is this permanent?	R
Delayed Notifications for Critical Apps	Hi All,I have a serious issue with delayed notifications that I cannot seem to resolve.I have two phones - a work iPhone 13 and my personal S22 Ultra.One example of this is Arlo Camera notifications (although this happens with just about every app).If both phones are sitting on my desk (untouched for several minutes) and someone triggers the Arlo cameras, I get an instant notification on my iPhone. However, the notification on theS22 Ultra could take anywhere from 5-20 mins to come through. Sometimes it only comes through when I pick up and unlock the phone. This happens on other apps installed on both phones as well.I have gone through all the settings trying to resolve this. Turning off "Put Unused Apps to Sleep" and "Adaptive Battery", and setting Arlo to Unrestricted in the Battery settings etc. None of this makes any difference.Is this a common issue? I have searched the interwebs and found many posts/comments about this type of issue. However, there doesn't seem to be a solid solution.Appreciateany guidance/feedback others may have as this is a show-stopper for this phone as I cannot trust it to provide real-time updates from my critical apps.Thanks in advance.

CERTAIN APPS CRASHING ON S22 ULTRA. HELP	It started two days ago and for no apparent reason apps like goat or DBZ LEGENDS just crash when loading. Is anyone else experiencing apps crashing and have any idea what might be going on?	R
Phone keeps switching to 2.4ghz band on wifi	"I have an Eero pro router so it only has one SSID. All of my other devices stay connected to the 5ghz network but for some reason my phone does not. When it switches to the 2.4ghz network I only hit 30-40mbps speeds whereas the 5ghz network gets 300mbps. I have to turn the wifi off and back on to get it to 5ghz, but then it switches itself to 2.4ghz a couple minutes later. 
Any way I can force the 5ghz without having to buy a new router with 2 dedicated SSIDs?"	R
Perf Z game plugins temperature not accurate	"Hi all, i am just wondering if the temperature shown in perf z is accurate or not.
Because sometimes it deviates around 2 degrees from the surface temperature of the phone (s22U SD). 
I also have a tab s8U (also using SD 8gen1) and also using perf z. Yet, my temperature reading in the tab s8U's perf z is quite accurate."	R
phone booting into safe mode	My s22 ultra 512gb a few times now has had the screen become unresponsive and then freeze, a few seconds later the phone reboots into safe mode. When this happens the phone feels like it is overheating. Has this happened to anyone else ? After another restart the phone is back to normal but my keyboard switches back to the Samsung keyboard when I had the Google keyboard selected before.	R
Camera Failed	I got a Galaxy S22 Ultra back in April and am getting ready to replace my phone under warranty for the second time due to constant camera failures. The first phone, the front camera would jump around, make clicking sounds, and then go to a black screen with a "Warning: Camera Failed" message. I had the camera in it replaced and it didn't fix the problem so I replaced my phone under warranty and spent 10 hours logging back into all of my accounts and reorganizing everything to the way I had it before. Less than 2 months after getting my second phone, the selfie camera has now stopped working and puts the camera on a black screen with a "Warning: Camera Failed" message that can only be fixed by going in and resetting the camera settings. No selfie camera means no video calls for work or to family overseas. This seems to be a huge issue with the S21 and S22 galaxy phones and Samsung seems totally ok with just ignoring it. I would switch to an Iphone in a heartbeat to not have to deal with this constant camera failed **bleep**.	R
Restore 180 Degree Screen Rotation	Samsung,This problem of disabling the ability to rotate the screen 180 degrees has been going on since an update in March. I googled a web forum where there was a link confirming that Samsung decided this was a "helpful feature" - aka you did it on purpose?! Please listen to us!When we are using Maps and have older vehicles that do not move the screen to an in-car display, the only way to use Maps and charge at the same time is to put our phone in a cup holder. This necessitates the phone being upside down. By removing this feature you have destroyed one of the most useful things that I was able to do on a day to day basis. It is enough to make me consider leaving the Samsung world, which I've been in since 2015.Please listen to your end users and provide a way to restore enabling 180 degree rotation for those who want it.

Google map issue?	Hi, I just got my S22 Ultra few weeks ago and I have experienced Google Map issue couple of times already. Some how after I planed the driving route on Google Map and try to click "Start Navigation" button it will just freeze and will not go to the next page. I had to restart the phone and that would fix the issue. Very disappointed. Anyone else experienced similar issue and is there a fix about this? Thanks!	R

Messages get stuck in download	So far this phone is beyond annoying. Messages keep getting stuck waiting to be downloaded even though I have my settings set the right way. I spent 50 minutes on the phone with AT&T and they reset my network settings and it fixed the problem for about a half an hour and now it's back. I see tons of complaints about this online and no solutions. Hating this phone already and I can't return it but this is a serious issue since undownloaded messages when they time out they just disappear and you never know what you missed. Between health issues in my family where I need to be available and knowing of emergencies, and work related texts this is a serious problem because I'm missing them.	R
Smart Lock Won't Work	The Smart Lock feature on my S22 Ultra does not work. I have tried several of the suggestions found on the internet. It will work for a while, then stops working.

S22 ultra high idle temps.	HelloI got s22 ultra. Runs 40-45degree on idle. When i browse it goes above 50-60 Also when i turn on the camera it ramps up to 80s. I took it to ubreakifix. They run samsungs diagnostic tool and didnt find any issue so they couldnt help it. What happens if i send this to samsung. Will they gonna run same.test and send the phone back and i will be losing 3weeks?also benchmark scores are very low to compare other s22 ultras. Even after factory reset nothing changes. So i wonder if any samsung rep can confirm that these temps are normal ?	R

Slow download speed only on 2.4 GHz wifi. Upload just fine. 5 GHz just fine. Only 2.4Ghz	I am 99% sure this is an S22 fault and not my network because it happens on both 2.4 GHz networks I use frequently.On a 50/50 fiber network, every other device I've used - laptop, chromebook, a Pixel 2, and a Moto whatever, they all have a 50/50 speed anywhere in the house.The S22 itself gets 50/50 if I'm within a few feet of the router but as soon as I get past 10 feet, the speed drops down to 20/50 and then 10/50 and by 30 feet download speeds are in the single digits while upload is still a very solid 50.I should mention that if I go even 50 or 60 feet away, the connection is still there and not dropped, but download is around 2 Mbits while upload is still pretty solid so I don't know if this indicates a hardware or software issue.I attempted to report this to Samsung but after running me through their scripts to "make sure you have a sim card inserted" and "do a factory reset" which I'm not going to do, they pointed me to come here and write a strongly worded post about it. Ok, they didn't say that but it seems like they don't really care one way or another.I did some googling and found others have similar issues with the S22 and the A lineup which I'd imagine uses some of the same hardware. Anybody else have this issue? How would we let samsung know about it?	R

Samsung s22 Ultra reboots randomly while driving with GPS	I was driving at night wirelessly charging the phone with my GPS holder, using Google maps and playing a YouTube video with Firefox in the background.

T-mobile Visual Voicemail	Anyone else having trouble with this? For over a month I've been trying to get it to work. Upon opening I get a message we are activating your account, please wait.

external audio/ microphone issue	"Has anyone run into a problem/solution w using external microphone or running external audio into s22 ultra via usb-c? I'm a musician so I have multiple options for hooking up audio sources to my phone. I have an external mic that hooks up via 3.5mm headphone hack to usb-c adaptor and then I have a separate audio interface  that I can mix multiple microphones and instruments to one main ""audio track"" and send (connected via 3.5mm to usb-c adaptor) that to the phone so it is automatically  synced up w a recorded video. 
The problem is I dunno if I have a bad adaptor or if it's the phone. I tried to go into pro video and select usb-c but it wouldn't allow me to. And the audio doesn't sound any different if I move microphones or adjust levels so it appears that it's not actually receiving the audio, but instead still using the phones built in microphone and bypassing everything else.  
This was a last minute set up tonight and just ran into that issue out of the blue. Gonna test tomorrow further,  but I'm really new to the phone so I wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something obvious or something else. 
TIA

Video Calls	So, I have recently been using my video calls a lot lately and the calls drop frequently! Galaxy phones are one if the top phones if not the best in my opinion, but in this area Samsung has really dropped the ball. If you move the call freezes, the camera will display green and the call will drop. Guess this is the reason Samsung has Duo as an option. Samsung is better than that. It's 2022. Let's go Samsung...

Cannot send MMS as a Mass Message	Hi All,So recently I found that the latest Galaxy phones cannot send a MMS as a 'Mass Message'. A mass message is different to a group message because it sends messages individually to multiple people.It's a simple and absolutely required feature that was once available for older galaxy devices and other phone brands.Is there a reason why Samsung removed this or is there a way I'm not aware of to work around it?Thanks	R

refresh rate issue	I have encountered a strange refresh rate issue on my Galaxy s22 ultra device, the screen adaptive refresh rate mechanism fails to identify on what refresh rate the device screen should be on some particular streaming apps like netflix, prime, vlc media player. My screen becomes sloppy as it reduces the screen refresh rate to a very low in the middle of the media consumption, it becomes sloppy for a very small moment of time but still it keeps on repeating frequently and that makes the experience very disturbing.

S22U's SPen is broken after a month of a light use	"I recently got my s22u and overall I'm very happy with it, until couple of days ago I tried to use my spen, it does not work as intended and I really wonder if anyone else experiencing the same, as I was not able to find a single post in the entire net!
Here is my issue
Spen is connected, it shows the pointer when I hover over the screen, but the phone does not register clicks/touches almost ever, it can register one touch after 15 physical touches to display, and sometimes after it does register click it refuses to ""deregister"" so when I raise the pen it still continues to write
Please share with me if you have experienced something similar
p.s.
I have tried reseting the settings, even ended up reseting whole phone, still no luck, I'm very mad, phone is brand new  
I have tried using other spens (2 others, one from note 20 and one from note 9), both worked perfectly, and vice-versa, my pen lagged the same way on the other devices as it is doing on mine
is there a way to physically reset the spen? "	R

Does everyone's s22 ultra suck ass or is it just mine?	So I've had this phone since it's been out basically and it's so much worse than the s21+ I traded for it. The battery is garbage(yes I've factory reset with and without using the Samsung switch app). The wifi calling sometimes doesn't even let me know I'm getting a call and won't let me call out when connected. My texts don't send randomly with 2+ bars of 5G or sometimes when I'm on wifi. This thing is such a disappointment even compared to my Note 8 and I'm wondering if I'm doing something wrong or if this is just a dud generation for the S series. I even have routines that come on top save battery and it still drains just as fast, only upside is the camera but this thing doesn't have an SD card so I can't even store much. I definitely have buyers remorse but I'm wondering if I just lost the silicone lottery with my phone or if others are disappointed as well.	R

Autofocus Painfully Slow	Maybe somebody can enlighten me.I recently purchased a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. Was so thrilled to finally get a new flagship phone after having my LG V60 for a few years. I was and still am very enthusiastic about the V60, it is one of the most underrated phones I think I've ever used. Unfortunately, with LG being out of the phone game, I just thought it was time to get into something new while that phone still worked. So I kept the V60 as a backup phone, and paid outright for this S22 Ultra. I was so excited to be able to use all these cool new camera features. But I'm going to be straight up honest and say that this camera although having a great zoom, pales in comparison to the quickness and clarity of the V60 camera. The autofocus is terrible on this thing. Not only does it not automatically autofocus very quickly, but if you tap the thing that you were trying to focus on, it almost never focuses very clear, or quickly. It generally just gives you the option to lock the "AE". Now in terms of using any of the zoom cameras. It's even worse. I struggle to get anything clear when it comes to taking a macro photo. Is it me? Or does anybody else agree that this auto focus is sort of lazy.I have pictures of the Milky Way that I have taken on my LG V60 on the long exposure, pro setting.. I have tried taking similar photos on my S22 Ultra, and no matter how still the camera is, all of the images look like the camera was moved/skewed/blurry. What exactly is going on? I'm getting to a point where I feel like something is wrong with my phone and I need to return it and get a replacement device..Anybody have a similar experience? I cannot be the only one.	R
Google Message/Chat	Since changing to the s22 from the s21 my chat features won't work with previous contacts. T-mobile or samsung seem to now know the issue. I've deleted google messages and the whole clearing cache still to no avail, is anybody out there that can help	R

App screen not showing all apps: Factory Reset???!!!	Some of my apps (e.g. Video Player) on my S22 Ultra don't show on my app screen, so I can't run them.When I go to Settings, then Apps, and scroll down I see Video Player. Everything about it looks fine.But, when I go to a Home screen and swipe up to my apps screens, it isn't there. It isn't in the Samsung box of Samsung apps, and when I click the + screen to try to add Video Player to the apps in the Samsung box, Video Player is not in the list of available apps. This is true, also, for Video Editor and Video Trimmer, and probably others.When I contacted Samsung through their video chat support, they alarmingly quickly told me to do a factory re-set, which is a PITA. It seems like maybe this is a known issue (maybe from one of the updates since I bought my phone when it first came out) and there's nothing else to do. I hate the idea of starting over.Maybe I should have posted this in "Get Help" but I've already had 2 Samsung support people tell me quickly and blithely to just do a factory re-set.	R

Phone not fully charging over night	"Hi all!   
I finally upgraded to from my Note 8!  I like to make my device last as long as possible. So I've set my charging to 85% max and turned off all fast charging.  When I plug in my phone at night it is usually around 20%.  Standard charging shows that it'll take about 5 1/2 to fully charge. It is plugged in for at least 7 hrs before I unplug it to get ready for work. However it is only charged to (on average) 56%.  Has anyone else had issues like this? I would prefer not to fast charge my phone, thanks."	R

Not clearing Gmail notification	"Often but not always, when I have a Gmail notification and I choose to open Gmail, rather than click on the notification, it doesn't clear the notification. I have to specifically clear the notification by swiping it away. 
I am pretty sure, in the past, on my prior phones (mostly Pixel), it cleared when I opened the app.

FYI on possible wireless Android Auto issues	"This might impact just a small number of people but I finally found the ""culprit"" of an issue I have been having with the wireless Android Auto.
Those of you getting ""Your phone is not responding"" message and disconnects from the car shortly after your phone is connected to the wireless Android Auto, the reason for me was that I had bixby routines set up where it would turn off the wifi toggle on my phone once disconnected from the house wifi when it's connected to my car or disconnected from the house wifi when you drive out of your map radius. When either of this routine triggers and turns off my phone's wifi toggle while the phone had already connected to the wireless AA, it would crash and attempt to reconnect to the phone again.
So make sure you turn off those routines if this annoys you or set the routine up in a way so that wifi would turn off before the phone connects to your car AA wirelessly."	R

Pocket detection doesn't work like it should	"So I've been using S22 Ultra for a couple of months now and I've noticed an annoying thing about the pocket detection. To unlock the screen while it's in a pocket (or the proximity sensor is covered) all you need to do is slide horizontally. This has caused countless unwanted interactions (especially skipping tracks and jumping podcasts).
In my previous phone, I had to follow w pattern of dots and it completely prevented the issue.

Zoom Blurry from 10x-100x?	So I got the S22 Ultra within 2 weeks the zoom was blurry if used 10x or more? I tried YouTube fixes, etc. Sometimes it refocus if I cover a lens but about 80% of the time it doesn't. Its been about 6 weeks now, I live 8hrs from the nearest city to get a replacement. Samsung was no help other than to suggest I go see a repair specialist 🙃 which would also be 8hrs away. I bought it for the zoom since I'm in the middle of nowhere and can often see kilometres of land with plenty of wildlife or interesting flora. At least I took a cool picture of a Wedge Tail Eagle within the first 2 days of owning it.... I guess.	R

Highlighting Text Limitation - Copying text doesn't work like it does on any other Samsung phones.	I have a S22+ that I got from Verizon.

Wrong number when using Call and text on other devices on tablet	Hi, I have a Galaxy S22 linked to my Tab S8+ Wi-Fi. I also have Call and text on other devices enabled. I can receive and answer calls from the phone on the tablet but not the other way around. When I try calling from my tablet, the call cuts off and when I look at my phone, there was this weird long number dialed.

Bixby routine for color adjustment not working	"Hi, I am trying to use Bixby routines to add grayscale to my phone. I enabled the developer mode on my phone and I enabled grayscale on my accessibility which I can use using power button and volume up key together. However, this is unwieldy and I wanted to add a shortcut to my Home Screen so I decided to use bixby routines.
However, as shown in the screen shot, it doesn't work and shows the error message. If I enable the grayscale using power button and volume up key, it will toggle just fine but nothing would change. I also tried to add color filter instead and that thing works perfectly, so I guess I screwed up something somewhere that Bixby isn't working. Any idea how to fix this?
P. S. I know about the grayscale switch app, but I don't want to install adb."	R

S22 Ultra unlocked modem network issues?	"eSim on AT&amp;T,  Verizon on physical sim. iPhone 12 and 13 in household, I'm the only one on S22 series. Unlimited Elite plan. 
My phone consistently gets 3/5megs down; whereas, iPhones get double or even triple that during day. iPhone gets into the triple digits at night, and mine doesn't. Wouldn't matter much if it wasn't a rural area but other option is satellite internet and that's trash... 
On ENHANCEDPHONE apn settings, latest software. Technically I have a better modem than either than iphone 12 and 13, but they're still smoking my ass. 
I don't know if it might be a modem issue given that sometimes when my Verizon sim drops out(at home) my phone doesn't scan for available networks and I manually have to put airplane mode going to a STRONG coverage area. Contact Sammie, or AT&amp;T on this one? Thoughts anyone?"	R

My facial features, hair and physique are blurry.	This sounds like a silly problem but I am in the fitness industry and take a lot of physique photos. Ever since I got the s22 plus my muscles are very smooth out as is my face and my hair. I have reset the camera settings back to normal plenty of times and I think all the filters are off but this is becoming problematic. I took some photos from my girlfriend's iPhone Pro 13 last night and they look terrific. Lots of definition and cuts and vascularity of which most of his smooth out and gone in the s22. As far as outdoor photography goes the s22 is the best thing I've ever seen but as far as my work stuff goes this is becoming troubling. Any advice? Thank you!	R
[S22plus]If you are experiencing stutterals, the changing these settings status might produce better results	"I have been experiencing stutters in my s22 plus. So, these are the settings I have changed and the results are so much better.

2.Set RAM plus to ""2GB""

These settings might not help you to eliminate all issues 100% but at least I hope they will make the phone you're using a bit smoother than what you are experiencing."	R

I have an annoying network issue since I bought this phone, let me try to explain it briefly:
When i use 4g I will often lose connection (France), but what is strange is that I have full signal and the 4G icon is still present. 
what I can note is that on the 4G icon there are 2 arrows, one which goes down and one which goes up, reception and transmission, the arrow always remains blocked upwards. 
Impossible to do anything on the internet, I have to switch to airplane mode... 
Here is what I tried: 
1-factory reset the phone 
2-Reset of network parameters 
3-order a new sim card 
But nothing helps, it becomes very annoying.

SAMSUNG FIX THE S22 SPEAKERS OR ACKNOWLEDGE THE ISSUE!!!	"The entire Galaxy S22 series has a severe design flaw that causes the speakers to crackle and distorts when exposed to pressure changes (elevation) or cold temperatures (&lt; 60 F).  [Samsung Galaxy S22 Speaker Distortion Crackling Popping - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mJT1EgqDPc). The author of this video received a replacement that worked for a couple of months, but then the crackling returned. I myself received two defective s22 phones in a row and others even got FOUR. This is not a one-off bad batch of phones, but likely an inherent design flaw. If you want to test your phone, put it in the freezer for 2-3 minutes to simulate cold winter temperatures, and then test the speakers. I guarantee many of you have the issue. The fact that Samsung is silent on this after multiple forums on reddit and their own support page is absolute BS. Please upvote! Trying to bring attention to this!

Robot voice	"Robot voice
So my wife and I were talking about a show we are watching on Netflix. I jokingly used a robot voice to say one thing ""no, Will Robinson"" after I said that she instantly sounded like a deep voiced robot..... I was completely shook. I asked how are you doing this and she was confused because she wasn't doing anything to change her voice so we got off the line. Now both of us being confused we called back and the robot voice was gone. I've experienced the normal bad reception robot voice but this was night and day different.....  she also explained after that I too sounded like a high pitched robot..... how can this be? Is this new tech? Please help. No way this was a coincidence."	R
Calls answered on Android Auto go to phone speakers	Hey all, I've been having this issue since I got the phone. Whenever someone calls me while I'm driving, I answer the call through my car screen but I can't hear anything, then I noticed the call was using my phone's speakers and not my car's, so I have to hang up and call the person back (if I place the call it goes through my car just fine). I can't even switch to the car speaker through my phone since the call menu does not show up while you're driving. Does anyone have a fix to that? I tried looking up online but nothing seems to fix the issue. (Btw, the phone is great but I kinda miss the seamless experience of Apple Car).	R
Camera settings are not working (video)..	"Hey everyone
A couple of weeks ago I bought a S22 ultra after using an S7 for years. 
Now I was particularly interested in this phone because of the (reviews of the) camera and I just like Samsung in general. Now is the quality lacking and I don't mean a bit but a lot. My S7 made better videos so I don't know what's wrong. I tried different settings but I just don't know what to do anymore. 
It's for filming myself when playing the video, when practicing languages and in the future probably when starting with gymnastics again. So at the moment it would be inside. 
Doe I need to use the x1 or x0.6 or anything else? I bought the 512 GB so I guess I have enough storage to film in the highest quality. Don't really know how many hours I could record because if I'm practicing languages it's possible there is a 1 to 2 hour recording every (other) day. 
The app: ""Device Info HW"" has Exynos 2200 as chip for my phone. I don't know if this correct or false info and whether this could be the problem but I'm pretty sure it won't be. (Apart from maybe being a little less in certain situations if I saw it correctly on YT videos where they did a comparison)
I hope someone can help me out with this and I appreciate anyone's help alot 
Gracias!"	R

Verizon S22 Ultra not switching to T-Mobile software after unlock.	"This is in the realm of mild annoyance, not a show-stopper.
I have a paid-for, Verizon-bought S22 Ultra that was automatically unlocked after the Verizon 60 day waiting period, and is now working fine with my T-Mobile SIM.
However, in the past, after a few reboots, previous Samsung phones would update and swap to the carrier software with their '[BYOD Experience](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00078492/)'.  This isn't required for the phone to work, and it's been working fine, but it still boots w/ the Verizon logo, and has the integrated Verizon apps.  Previous Samsung phones would update on a reboot, and use the T-Mobile splash, uninstall Verizon specific apps, and install T-Mobile specific apps (or vice versa if switched back to Verizon again).
Anyone know if the S22 is different wrt the BYOD experience, or if there's a way to trigger the software update to the T-Mobile flavor?"	R

Photos end up distorted	Hi all, I've had my S22 ultra for about two months now and I've been having some issues with the photos.. for example, I tried taking some pictures of the full moon tonight. Everything looked great while taking the picture but when I went to look in my gallery, the photos looked incredibly distorted. I'm not talking about some warping, I mean it looks like there's rainbow static instead of a photo. It's happened before when taking regular pictures before, but never this bad. Can't seem to find any info on this. Any ideas? Thanks!	R
Unable to receive or place calls daily	S22 Ultra. Every day I need to reboot my phone at least once to restore the ability to make or receive calls. My wife has the same phone without this problem. We're both home most times so it's the same environment. Anything I can do or do I just have a bad phone? Not even sure how to begin troubleshooting.	R
Google Assistant popping up when I swipe up from the bottom left/right, can I disable this without disabling Google Assistant altogether?

"Heads-up"/ "brief" System Pop Up Notification Settings	"I am wondering if anyone here has any tips as far as ways to edit or change anything about the pop-ups that appear at the top of your screen when you get notifications (for example, you get a text and that bubble appears in the top of the screen). 
I know you can turn them off, but I don't really want that. I'd like to be able to change where they appear, the duration, maybe things like that. The system settings don't give you any options other than just turning it off, but the location of the pop ups is really inconvenient as it's typically where things like search bars and stuff like that are. 
Is there some sort of third party app or anything I can do to change any of this? I swear in earlier Android versions you had much more in terms of customization of this, but now every app is locked into the same static, inconvenient system setting."	R
Garmin notifications	Every since switching to the GalaxyS22 ultra a few months ago my Garmin notifications have been hit or miss. I use it mainly to buzz me for text messages. I have the battery setting on both Garmin Connect and my messaging app to Unrestricted. The text notification works on the phone but it doesn't always buzz my watch. I wonder if it loses connection. It is not that I am far away from the phone - the Garmin sometimes doesn't buzz even when I have my phone in my pocket.	R
Camera failed, works fine in Airplane mode.	"Hello, I saw in another thread that someone mentioned turning on airplane mode fixes their camera issues.  Turns out it fixes mine too.
My camera stutters and the app crashes, but the diagnostic camera works fine.  clearing camera cache, and the phones cache, as well as disabling all apps access to the camera did nothing, nor did a factory wipe.
But the camera works flawless in airplane mode, not even a stutter to it. no crashes.
Anyone experience this or have any other fix? turning on airplane mode every time I want to take a picture is obnoxious.
Also to add to that, I've had the phone since launch, it crashed occasionally but only in the last few weeks is it crashing every time I use the camera, unless its in airplane mode."	R
Bad Camera Quality for Close Ups?	"Hey folks, has anyone else noticed that their s22 close up photos have really bad focus fall off? 
Sample image: [https://imgur.com/a/dRapJVM](https://imgur.com/a/dRapJVM) kinda gross macbook keyboard, but it's a flat object and you can see how the D is in focus (where I tapped) but even though the camera and keyboard are on the same plane... even one letter over is blurry. 
Part of me wonders if this is the ML at work... but I don't know. Do I have a below-average camera, or is this just how the camera performs?
Thank you!"	R

S22 ultra wifi6 issues	"Hey peeps,
So I got this Ultra less than a week ago and have been having slow speeds with wifi6 networks.
When I connect to a wifi6 network I barely get above 500kbps, while none wifi6 networks get me above 80Mbps.
On my home wifi6 network it first treats it as a regular wifi and gets me 80Mbps but as soon as it's shows the wifi6 logo top right it drops to 500-300kbps.
If the switch happens during speed test, I go from 80Mbps to 300kbps during the test.
On top of it all I jump from 2ms latency to over 400ms!
In the settings app it shows fluctuating network speed from 170Mbps to 800+Mbps while still giving me 300kbps.
I tried a full android wipe/reset without using any backups and issue persists.
On 5g I get expected speeds.
Any ideas?
I tried setting to unmetered and phone mac and that has done no changes.
In my router's settings if i set to not use wifi6 I keep at 80Mbps with 2ms.
I've went and purchased a new Asus router thinking my ISP's offering is bad. Exact same scenario.
I'm out of ideas."	R
Charge Port Not Working	US T-Mobile S22 Ultra, 128G, Software Version: S908USQU2AVG6 / S908UOYN2AVG6 / S908USQU2AVG6. I very rarely use my charge port, 99% wireless charge unless I need a quick charge before leaving home. My charge port gave me a message that my charge port was wet maybe 2 weeks ago, even though it has not been anywhere near moisture. Then started working fine a few hours later. Fast-forward to last night, I was camping so used my cable and a Anker power bank to charge my phone while I slept. Wake up this morning and my phone didn't charge at all. Tried different cords, wall outlets, but still doesn't work. I turned it off and back on, charge port still doesn't work. It does charge wirelessly fine though. My phone is 25 days old, never been dropped, and never been wet. Anyone have this issue?	R
S22 Ultra Super Fast Charging	"Hey guys have been using the S22 ultra since launch and have been using the 45W official charger from Samsung. I've recently bought the fancy new cables that show how fast a phone is charging. Whenever I plug the cable into the phone it doesn't go above 18-19Watts of PD charging. I know there is nothing wrong with the cable cause when I use it to charge my Laptop it goes upto 95-98 Watts. I've used two different 45 watts chargers and it still maxes out at 19 watts and not even 25 or 45. Is anyone else having some problems with fast charging or is it a known fault on Samsung. Any kind of help will be appreciated. 
Thanks"	R
Tik Tok Burn In Issues	I just upgraded to the 22 ultra a couple of days ago. I traded in my s20+ that I ahd a little over two years. Tik tok had created a decent amount of burn in on my s20+ screen. I'm not sure if it was due to me generally having a higher brightness on my phone (I'm using adaptive now) or if tik tok is just horribly set up with its static buttons always being in the same place on the screen. I don't watch generally more than 2 hours of Tik tok a day (around the time I'm trying to fall asleep). Is there anything I can do other than just not using Tik tok on my s22 ultra to prevent burn in from Tik tok? Any help would be greatly appreciated, and yes I've looked at other reddit posts about tik tok burn in and haven't found anything to be a fool proof plan on mitigating the problem.	R

Choppy 1st video after opening camera.	"Firstly, the camera is slow. Specifically, when I try to record a video after opening the camera for the 1st time,  it always comes out choppy. 
The problem is a little bigger than this, if I have recorded a video using the wide lense already than it will function as normal. But if I switch to 3x or 10x telephoto lense, again it will be choppy for first few seconds.
This is not a rant, but this is supposed to be the pinnacle of android. And does not seem to look like it. Any suggestions on improving it? I may have made a mistake by messing with settings as well.
The video was taken in FHD 30."	R
S22 Utra keeps dropping wifi/Bluetooth connections	"Phone keeps randomly dropping home wifi connection and BT connections to Garmin tactix charlie watch, Samsung watch, Samsung earbuds, and Ford sync.

Mobile data not turning on after leaving Wifi	Mobile data isn't turning on automatically after leaving Wifi. It happens randomly. I only notice when I look at the phone and notice it isn't connected to mobile data. Turning on airplane mode for 10 seconds and back off fixes it, but it's frustrating. I have mobile data set to be on all of the time, even when connected to WiFi - so I have no idea why this is occurring.	R

Screen turns off during call if you try to use other apps?	"Had this issue a few minutes ago...had to look something up in chrome while I was on a call, so I launched the app with the call running in the background, and then I couldn't tap the address bar at the top because going anywhere near it with my finger would trigger the proximity sensor??? I've owned several android phones before including a note 9, and I've never had this happen. If I ever left the phone call screen on other phones, the proximity sensor would disable so I can actually use the phone. I had to go grab another device to actually look up what I needed. 
I tried looking in phone and android settings for a toggle related to this but came up empty. Any ideas how to fix this behavior so you can actually look something up if you need to?"	R
Screen artifacting while in HQHD+	"Starting having the same issue I saw people on this subreddit about 5 months ago about screen issues and artifacting. In those posts people mentioned that samsung was aware and there was a fix coming.
Did that fix ever come and if so why would It suddenly start happening today? Switching the FHD+ fixes it just like the posts from 5 months ago, but obviously that is not a solution I'd be happy with.
Appreciate any help that may be out there!"	R
GPS Interference	"I know the S22 has had some GPS issues but I'm not sure if this issue I'm having is directly related.
I keep getting the searching for GPS when using Maps when I set my phone in the only place I've ever put my phone for navigation. When I pick my phone up, it finds GPS and continues navigation. Place it back where I need it and it loses GPS. I've used the GPS calibration apps to check signal and it shows a very low signal when the phone is placed anywhere near my center console or up on the dash or you know, anywhere that would be a convenient place to stick your phone and view navigation while driving.
So of course this would lead one to think that obviously my car is causing the issue and it's not the phone. But I never had this problem with my S21 or my S20 placing my phone where I always have. Currently, my dad's S21 can be placed exactly where I place my phone and his navigation works perfectly fine while mine is searching for gps. My sister's iPhone will use navigation just fine in the same spot. It's only my phone that will not aquire GPS in those spots so clearly this is a S22 issue.
Is this issue common and one covered under the Currently known GPS issues? Is there something I can do?"	R

Maps not working on S22 since Aug. update	Since last update Maps freeze if I stop it during a route and start again. Then I can't get out of it and the screen goes black.

Blinking video during YouTube livestream	"I did a livestream on Sunday with my new S22. I formerly did my streams with an S6 and they operated smoothly. My issue is very annoying and I can't find a guide to help me fix the issue. I like to stream weekly so I need help sorting my issue before next Sunday if possible. 
Here's my process:
1. Schedule livestream via YouTube app.
2. When I'm about to go live, I click the button that says 'go live'.
3. That's it. Everything else is default. It's meant to be simple.
I was told by someone in my chat there's an issue with shutter speed. I did some tests by changing the shutter speed in the 'Pro' section of the camera but it doesn't seem to translate into the livestream. 
I'm concerned about the blinking and those who are sensitive to it. Please see my link for more details. The blinking itself is persistent but irregular. 
Thanks in advance.

Whatsapp Voice Note Audio Recording Randomly Low Volume	"Hello,
When I record a voice through whatsapp, sometimes it will do it well with no issues, and about half the times it will send the audio which sounds like I was talking through 30 blankets, very dimmed and seemingly EQ'd. I've seen this phenomenon in multiple phones but most of them are really old phones or alternative brands... just bought an S22 and it's just a major PITA recording a 1 min voice note and then it's just worthless.
Microphone works great on calls. Googling and googling can't seem to find people with the exact issue, just some people that either mic not works or playback volume is low and it's generally simple fixes. This problem to me happens completely at random and I have no visual feedback of when the voice is recording correctly or crapping out, until I've finished the voice and I can see in the waveform its just crap.
My wife's phone (samsung A50's) does this too, but rarely. I had an LG that did this all the time. Not sure if it's software or hardware or proximity detection or automatic leveling. Don't know how to troubleshoot this or replicate the issue, just happens in about 30% of my voice-notes.
Just wondering if anyone else has the same issue with S22-Whatsapp."	R

Can't store multiple eSIMs on my Verizon Galaxy S22?	"Hi there,  
I have a Samsung Galaxy S22 US model (SM-901U) on Verizon (US carrier). The phone was purchased from Verizon and I'm connected to Verizon via eSIM. I'm already past the 60 days no-unlock policy and I'm able to use dual SIM with the physical SIM card, so it seems that the unlock status shouldn't be the issue. I know that I (should) be able to store multiple eSIMs on my phone but I can only have 1 active eSIM at a time. Even when I have my eSIM turned off (wifi connected though), I receive the following error message:
""Can't add plan  
To add a new plan you need to remove your other eSIM mobile plan""  
Any advice on how I can store multiple eSIMs? Is this Verizon being shitty by enforcing a 1 eSIM-only policy? Thanks for any help.

UI Navigation lag s22 Ultra	"Hi everyone!

Is the HDR brightness issue fixed on One Ui 5.0?

Even my older phones which supports HDR can play brighter HDR videos than on the S22 Ultra. Since then I have been regularly posting hoping to gain mass attention for Samsung themselves to be aware of this problem.
Months I have waited hoping with every security update each month they will fix the issue. Even now, 6 months after release, the issue has not been resolved. As a person who loves watching movies and shows, I can barely accept this.
Now that One UI 5 Beta is out, I am hoping this issue to be fixed. To all the users with the Beta and having the HDR issue prior, has the issue been fixed?"	R

battery life	"I don't get a full day of use on my S22U. I assume its b/c I have the protect battery feature enabled where my charging stops at 85%. I start my day at 5 am and by 4 pm its definitely at 20%. I don't want it to get lower in fear of ""damaging the battery"" (don't know if those claims from older devices are still valid). I listed to audiobooks almost all day work. Mild texting, maybe 1 hour total of browsing sites and 30 mins of youtube vids. Signal is atrocious in my work office so I use wifi calling and disable 5g and use 4g/LTE. Also I turn location services off.  
Does this sound unusual or within the realms of ok? Do others charge to 100% and let their device get as low as possible? I'd like to keep this device at least a year if not longer.

Settings keeps stopping after system update	"Second time this has happened on a system update. First time was on the very first security update after S22 launch. I was forced to Factory Reset my phone due to lack of any other solution. I since started shunning any and all system updates. A few nights ago the update screen popped open unexpectedly causing me to accidentally confirm the update. I crossed my fingers, but surely enough, the same thing happened again: settings keeps closing. 
Only information I could find on this issue is for Galaxy A series, where the recommended solution is to uninstall Digital Wellbeing. But Digital Wellbeing is not installed on my device, and nor is it compatible with the S22 according to the Play Store. 
I'm extremely annoyed that Samsung keeps forcefully pushing these updates that cause me to lose all data.

I can easily uninstall/reset apps via ADB, but I have no leads on where to begin, and don't want to break it further by uninstalling the wrong package."	R

has anybody used "link to windows" for windows 10? Help	" so i was trying to use the ""link to windows"" feature, and everything went smooth according to the instructions, until the phone scans the QR code, and then asks for the 0 digit code shown on pc. but the problem is, theres no code. nothing happens to the pop up window with the QR code, i have to manually click ""done"", and then it closes, and then im just stuck on ""please open your phone companion - link to windows and sign in with (\_\_insert my email here\_\_)"", and then a forever spinning circle thingy made up of dots. and underneath that, ""did you know you could sign in with QR code?"" and a button that says ""generate QR code"".
from what i noticed, one of two things could be happening. 1. the windows app isnt signing in properly, it looks like its trying to sign in and its stuck for some reason? or 2. it needs the android app to scan the QR code properly in order to sign in, which i dont think its doing, cuz when i point my phone at my screen, it doesnt even get to the QR code, as soon as even 1/4 of the QR code shows up on my screen, mind you, not even in the scanning box, just on the side, the app would stop the same way as if it just scanned something, and then at the bottom, theres a brief pop up that says ""something went wrong. please ensure the same account is signed in on the pc""

Android Auto Will Not Connect to Car	"I bought a new Samsung Galaxy S22 (Android 12) in March 2022, and up until a few days ago (third week of August 2022), Android Auto started right up when I connected the phone to the car via USB. It worked perfectly. And then a few days ago, I could not get Android Auto to connect to my car. 
Since then I have tried what seems like dozens of things to try to get it to work. For example, I tried everything here, here and here. No success. I have tried three different USB cables, one of them brand new (never been used before) from Anker (each of these three other cables does charge the phone however). I have factory reset the car's infotainment system. I have disconnected the phone from my car's USB port, and then reconnected it. I removed the phone from the car's Android Auto list of phones, and then reconnected it. Android Auto on my phone seems to want to start, and things on the screen notification bar at the top indicate that Android Auto wants to start, but it never shows up on the car screen and the phone indicates I need to connect it via USB cable to the car (it is already connected). One odd thing which may (or may not) be a clue — Bluetooth pairing show's my phone's real named which is ""Paige's S22"" but the car's Android Auto settings list the phone as ""No Name"".

Not connecting to Android Auto	My head unit in my CRV has wireless android auto and my S22 Ultra always connected, no problem. The other day it wouldn't connect, you could see the screen on the phone blink like it was connecting but it just wouldn't fully connect. I turned car off and restarted, restarted phone, still nothing. So I tried the wired connection and it still wouldn't connect. Later on I tried uninstalling the app but I found out you can't fully uninstall only knock off updates and when I plugged in phone the app would pop on and say "update" which I would have to do and still nothing. I did plug in my Pixel 6 Pro and that worked just fine Android Auto popped right on. I then decided to install another head unit I had which only has wired Android Auto and Pixel 6 Pro worked, Fold 3 worked, S22 Ultra nope. I even installed my AAwireless adapter Pixel 6 Pro worked, S22 Ultra nope. I tried downloading the newer versions of Android Auto they didn't work either. Yes I tried different USB cables even though cables aren't used for AAwireless or the other head unit. This really has me puzzled.	R
noticed that the phone has a lot of lagging and bugs after latest update	"If I turn on the camera from the lock screen it's not working properly. I have to unlock the phone and open the app.
Instagram - i can't post multiple pictures to one post.
The phone sometimes lags and nothing works.
My volume buttons are all bonkers. Not working at all so I have to go in to settings to adjust the volume. Which means I can't do a hard reset töwhen it lags. I will send it in under the warranty but it will take weeks to get i back.
Phone was working fine before. I feel really sad that it took such a nosedive after the update."	R
Haptic feedback suddenly audible...	"As the title states: a week or so ago, my 3 month old S22U suddenly started making an audible ""click"" every time a tap was registered. This click is perfectly in sync with the vibration used for feedback, and it comes and goes as it pleases. Phone angle doesn't matter, in hand vs. on a flat surface doesn't matter. I'm just suddenly getting random audible clicks, as if the vibration motor has come loose and is hitting the case from within.
My phone is on silent 100% of the time, so I know this isn't a setting issue. If I turn off haptic feedback, the sound stops. Does this sound like a warranty issue? I don't have a backup phone available to be able to send this one in for repair. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."	R
Why is HDR so tempermental on the S22U?	"For every thing that is good about this phone camera, there is too often something that sours the experience.
My latest gripe is I have a work supplied iPhone SE (2022) that for a *laugh* I thought I'd compare pics with and... I was absolutely shocked to see how bad HDR performed on the Ultra in comparison. In fact, the iPhone blew it out of the water - it wasn't even close! I can't share the pics as they have my kid in them - but I have been a big advocate for the Ultra to date - and it's only now I can see that it's handling HDR poorly.  I have the Snapdragon version, unlocked, and on August update.
Blacks are quite black, highlights blown, and highlights on faces too - not just scenes. It's not all the time but it's often enough that it's really annoying. The processing seems happy to make sure the sky is blue and all - but toally ignores the other bits and pieces. It's very odd, and I find that it happens mostly in really bright settings.
I have regret - there is nothing fundamentally wrong with this phone. It's huge, great screen, great camera mostly, and Samsung's One UI is lots of fun - but I am thinking of selling and using the work phone until Samsung does better - or maybe never, just use a free phone that takes better daytime pics than my supposed super phone.
Of course, what I love about this camera are its astro, zoom, portraits, and workflow for RAW files. But I guess it feels less 'shoot quickly and in the moment' and more 'greateness awaits in post'. Which I have a dedicated camera for already. 
Am I the only one having this battle with HDR in pics?"	R
SPen Problem	"Anyone have issues with their S Pen? When I take it out, the button works but I can't write or use the screen with it. In Air Actions it shows ""Inside Phone"" even though it is taken out.

Already check my tempered glass all ok. Touch screen also looking fine. But, my screen keep triggering back button. Never dropped my phone could be display issue? Restart my phone didn't help either.		R
shooting video silences system sounds	"Whenever I shoot a video (default camera app), my S22 Ultra turns off system sounds. That makes sense during the video, but the system sounds remain off afterward until I manually move the system-sound slider back up. It's especially annoying if I'm alternating between taking videos and photos, because I like to hear the shutter sound as confirmation that a photo was taken, but the shutter sound goes away when system sounds are turned off. 
I originally encountered this problem on my S21 Ultra, but it has followed me to my new S22 Ultra, so I assume it's a widespread issue."	R

Some apps are having an issue with location based features. Very inconsistent. Please help	"All of a sudden in the last month or so I am having serious issues with two apps that use location based features. August Smart Lock and Google Home. August should know when I'm in the neighborhood and then unlock my door and Google Home sets itself to ""home"" and turns on a few lights before I enter the home. It's very inconsistent now. Sometimes the location features work and sometimes they don't. I have tried every little trick I can think of that would help with so success (Checked all location based permissions, those apps battery settings have been set to ""unrestricted"", I have even factory reset the phone). And it's something with the device location and not the apps IMO, because they usually both work and fail at the same time. So something is inconsistently restricting the location to those apps. 
Can you guys recommend anything else to try to figure this out? 
Thanks"	R
clock disappears on lock screen	So I keep running into an issue where my lockscreen clock disappears after setting it up with lockstar and clock face from goodlock.

Fixes for extreme camera glitching... is there really no fix for this problem?	"So after searching this page for quite awhile I've seen one of the common issues is shutter lag.  
I ordered a s22 ultra about a month ago and whenever I tried to use the camera either in its normal application or in a secondary app like snapchat or creating a Facebook story etc. it was extremely hard to use. Things I never once had an issue with on my 1.5 year old S21 Ultra.
The one thing I can compare it to is when you ramp up the graphics settings in a videogame on your pc past what your graphics card can process and it begins lagging from frame to frame.  
This happens whenever I take a video and something moves, or if I'm trying to move the camera at all while trying to focus in on something to take a picture.  
I tried updating everything, factory resetting, clearing the cache, lowering the screen resolution to the minimal resolution etc..  
Nothing worked that I could find on any of the posts listed on here.  
I figured it was a hardware issue so after a week I contacted Samsung and reported it, they said it most definitely was and I could send in my phone for a replacement.  
Fast forward to a week later, I received my replacement phone.   
I went through the startup process and didnt transfer anything from my existing phone.  
Then made sure everything was up to date.  
I started absolutely fresh so the memory was maximized.   
This issue still persisted when using the camera application.  
So now its clear its not just that one phone having this issue.  
So the question is, is there seriously not a fix for this?"	R

Horrible Camera post processing, hdr, artifacts, color bleeding etc	"[https://i.imgur.com/POgIuiT.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/POgIuiT.jpg)
Hello, I think I'm about to go insane from how much I have tried to google and search about this issue to find out if others are experiencing it or if its just me.
I am having the following issues with the camera app of my S22 Ultra USING THE FRONT FACING SELFIE CAMERA (brand new in the last month or so):
\- awful shutter lag / lag in general
\- Color bleeding / burn
\- Orange / Yellow tones added mostly to the skin / clothes
\- I think its HDR related but can't turn it off because they removed that feature
\- Taking a photo of  someone with the sky in the background just mostly comes out white
\- Similar kind of issues with artificial lighting either blown out or bleeding
Edit: Can't use camera raw / expert raw / pro camera / raw photos as I use the front facing camera!
I've had this happen primarily using the front facing camera, as that is what I use day-to-day for my work. I've had it happen sometimes using the back camera.
This doesn't happen every time I press the shutter, but it happens EVERY time that I am using the camera app. I could take 3 photos in a row and they could all be fine, all do the glitch or some do and some don't.
I have tried natural sunlight, artificial light, makeup, no makeup. Directly showing the LED strips / light panels in the background and then moving so they're not in shot, same with natural sunlight / the sky reflecting from the mirror, I've tried positioning so its not shown and it still does the issue.
The most noticeable issue is the insane color burn that it adds to photos at times, its almost like the color is just bleeding and has been turned up to 10000% saturation. The yellow and orange added to the skintones and hiar as well is infuriating because it just cannot be fixed in lightroom.
I've attached some photos in both natural lighting and artificial lighting for context. I've also added the ""motion"" photo still where the colors are correct and no post processing has been done, however, simply taking a still from one of these isn't a solution as the quality is completely destroyed..
If anyone at all knows what this could be or how to fix it I would love to know. I sadly can't just hand over my phone and wait weeks for it to maybe be fixed or replaced as I use the camera every day for my work &amp; on the chance that its not just a factory defect and its happening to everyone, I wouldn't really want to go through that process only to  get it back and it still do the same thing. Its my last resort but I would really like to exhaust other options and hopefully find out if this is happening to others before going down that path!"	R

WI fi speed drops	Got the s22 ultra a week ago. Noticed the wifi speed drops randomly. When it's working properly, speed test shows 300 mbps. When it's slow, it's 5 mbps. Disconnect/reconnect will reset the speed to high speed. Any ideas why?	R

Is this an issue with the spen or because I have a screen protector on?

struggling with camera viewfinder lag. are you too?	"Hi People.. im having it really difficult to bear with camera lag, i find it almost unusable for me. I prefer to ask for me wifes iphone 8 to take a photo.

Any  advice or cheering word will be appreciated."	R
Moisture Symbol from car AC?	"The past couple of days when I've gotten gas, I've shut my car off to pump and as soon as I do, the phone's moisture detection comes on. It's not near water, it's in a cradle that's attached to the CD player. As soon as I take out the USB-C plug it goes away. Then, after I'm done getting gas I plug the USB back in and never see it again... It's a weird phenomenon that I'm wondering if anyone else is experiencing? 
Thanks in advance."	R

What kind of battery life are you guys getting?	I'm getting ready to switch from a Pixel 6 because the battery on this thing cannot last me a whole day anymore, dying about an hour before my shift ends if I don't charge on my breaks.

Wifi drops out, can't reconnect? Can't find IP address??	In the last few days, maybe 4 or 5 days, I've been having this issue where my S22 Ultra will lose connection to whatever wireless network I'm on, whether at work, at home, at a stupid Starbucks, and when I try to reconnect, it'll say at first it can't reconnect, then it'll say it can't find IP address. It'll be like this until I reboot the phone, and it'll connect just fine. I've had to reboot the phone at least once each day since it started. Anyone else getting this issue? I didn't see a post going back at least a week so hoping anyone else has seen this	R
My s22 Ultra has absolutely awful performance, what is wrong?	That's it really what I say in the title. I bought it a few months back and it is somehow miles worse in performance than my 3 year old s10 plus ever was. It lags constantly, battery can be gone by 11am just scrolling through twitter, and it gets so hot using simple apps like twitter or reddit that the screen has to dim itself. Surely there has to be something wrong with it as this can't be the peak of what Samsung can do?? I transfered all my data and apps from the old phone so maybe something went wrong there? How do I check what though? I'd prefer to go without reseting my phone especially when that does not guarantee any results	R
Notification sounds mixup?	So after the august update, I have a mix of applications reverting their notification sound to the default samsung one, whilst some others are using the one I've set from settings. Can't seem to find the individual application notification sound settings.. Anyone can shed some light on this?	R
instagram story bug	has anybody noticed/experience this? when im viewing through instagram stories, sometimes, not all the time, when i tap right to see the next story, it would just stop loading, the paused imagine is like 360p, and i see a circle on the top right corner circling, and if i dont touch it, it just never loads, but if i tap left to go back, then tap right again to come back to the same story, it loads perfectly smooth, no issues at all. i never had this problem with my p20 pro. anybody know whats going on? is it a setting?	R
Nova launcher glitches and lag	Is anyone else experiencing a sluggish performance or frequent lag with nova launcher usage? Apart from the lag, very frequently it takes me to a whole different app when I try to access one of the apps or widgets on tune home screen. Coding on the Google search bar takes me to the one ui search bar like every 2 out of 3 times I click it on the home screen	R
Bixby routine failing/repeating	"So I have this routine set to when I'm connected to my wifi at home, it sets to 2G (better signal where I live), wait 5 seconds and then disable the mobile data.
But during the night, this routine keeps repeating for some reason.
I even receive a notification informing: ""the routine is structured to repeat multiple times and it was disabled""  
My wifi internet is not dropping during the night.
What could be causing this issue? During the day this doesn't happen. 
I have a routine to disable bluetooth, auto sync and turn on the power saving when I'm sleeping.

Google maps lag	I have been experiencing a lag with google maps ever since I bought the phone. Whenever I open the maps app and and enter a location, it lakes like 30s to 1 min to show me the route, eta, etc. And lately the overall experience has become really glitchy. Is there anything I could do to make it better? My dad has a OP10pro and Google maps app smooth as butter and totally glitch free	R
Instagram optimization	Honestly I'm pretty disappointed to the camera optimization with Instagram. At first I was fine because I was like whatever it's the same bs that been said since s10, but then I saw how snapchat have not only nightography, but also uses all the camera that it can do the 100x zoom. Plus, camera quality is much better. Then it became a deal breaker after seeing my girlfriend's Z flip 4 Instagram. Holy crap her Instagram camera was so optimized it made my phone look poopie doo doo.	R
Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra Fast Charging issue	"Hi Everyone,
I don't know if my phone has a problem but in my latest update on my S22 Ultra (SD) whenever I try to use FAST CHARGING on a SUPER FAST CHARGER (latest charger) it doesn't work. I can only use SUPER FAST CHARGING on a super fast charger. Has anyone experience this issue?"	R
Data speeds extremely slow?	"Anyone else having really slow data speeds? When on 5g, I'm barely getting above 10mbps on a good day. I also have an s21 fe on the same network, and it gets 200+ mbps in the same places.
I've worked with my network, and nothing worked with them"	R
S22 Ultra Launcher Bug	"The problem with mine is upon quick succession from any app (I'm using Niagara Launcher) to home screen, the phone fails the register its first tap. Instead it takes 1-1.5secs to register the tap upon taping next. This only happens while using any other launchers apart from OneUI home. 
If you see in the video, every 2nd tap on the Google button fails to perform action, but after 1-1.2secs its perferoms the action. 
As per the recording, the phone is registering the tap but not performing the action. 
This is very stupid on Samsung's part. They must fix it.
Anyone else noticed this issue.?"	R
Camera kind of leaves a bit to be desired?	"So I've been using the camera bit more than usual here lately, and I really feel like once you get past the 10x zoom, the camera is just not what it's hyped up to be? Pictures even at 15x are pretty pixelated and kind of embarrassing for such a high end phone.
Does anyone else have this problem or am I doing something wrong?"	R
Game controller use worsened on S22Ulta. Keeps display at a constant 60Hz and induces input lag.	"\[**Note:** This was written the day I got the phone. I was initially planning to post this that day, but thought maybe this will get fixed via system or app updates. Four months later and I see the issue is still present. So here I am.\]
Before the GS22U, I had its predecessor, the GS21U. I liked to play games that had controller support. Minecraft was my most played one and the game always played relatively smooth. I assumed the experience would be the same, if not better, with my upgrade to the GS22U. Off the bat, I noticed choppy framerate and very noticeable input lag. I thought maybe the render distance was too high so I put down the controller and used touch to adjust the graphic settings. As soon as my finger made contact with the screen, the frame rate jumped up and everything was smooth. I went back to playing with the controller, and after 5 seconds, choppy framerate and very noticeable input lag. Probably something up with my controller, switch to a different one and same issue occurred. Thought it was just Minecraft, but the issue still occurred in other games. Something similar also happens in apps that are not games. I quickly found out that this was a system wide thing.
I tried Googling, but I couldn't find anything pertaining to my issue. So, I did my own testing. I came up with the following results.
[Refresh Rate tests](https://preview.redd.it/mmhcars8x9k91.png?width=1385&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb4f44394bdef2b068744c305b695ca632c7e623)
Notes:
* The phone I used for comparison is me mum's GS21+ as it has the same display (although lower res) as the GS21U.
* Google results consisted of issues with the GOS, but the game was running relatively fine on my end when playing with my fingers
* Both phones ran One UI 4.1 and had the latest Aug 1 security update.
* The same apps and games were tested on each device and all of them support 120Hz refresh rate.
* Two different controllers were used, each via Bluetooth and Wired connections. Results were the same for both.
Refresh rate test results
I came to the conclusion that it has something to do with the LTP0 display meaning that this issue is (probably) exclusive to the GS22U. My question is, has anyone experienced the same thing I have? If so, have you found a fix / workaround?"	R
I've never seen a battery this inconsistent.		R
I'm so disappointed that this phone gets so hot doing basic stuff like using social media apps even though I'm on snap dragon. Can this ever be fixed with a software update?	"I'm devastated since i dropped $1800 cad on this thing. The sad thing is I never had this issue during the 15 day return period, only like 25 days after which was horrible timing. 
The s22 ultra has a powerful chip right? So I doubt this is a hardware issue. Something in the software has to be consuming more resources than it needs.
I never had this issue with my OnePlus 6 from 2018."	R

S22 Ultra Exynos AVH9 Update	"Yesterday, on the 29th of August I updated my S22U Exynos on AVH9, the camera update and ever since I have tons of connectivity errors. My phone would lose connection every now and then, I even got H+ instead of 5G. Sometimes I'd not even get 4G, no data at all.

S22 ultra bluetooth issue.	"So in July everyone on my plan upgraded to the s22 ultra. I upgraded from the Note 9 which has been the best phone i have had. Since upgrading i have had an issue with the Bluetooth on with my car. During calls it will randomly disconnect and go back to the radio leaving the call on my phone, it will say it is still connected to the bt and i have to switch the mode to handset to continue my call.
This seems to be an issue with my phone only. My mother uses the same car as i do and has not had the issue, the only difference with our phone is I have the black and she has the rose gold both with the same storage. This also only seems to happen in the car during calls only, I never have issues with media nor issues with calls on my ear buds. I have disconnected all devices from my car and reconnected only the ones that are still in use. 
I sent logs into samsung and they could not find an issue with it. So im hoping that i can find help here."	R

I recently purchased a Galaxy S22 (approximately 3 weeks ago). I noticed that I need to pug/unplug the charging cable several times before I get the phone to start charging. I'm using the cable provided by Samsung and the Google 18W Charger I use for my Pixel 4a5g. 
Any thoughts on this? 
Thanks!"	R
FB video sound issues	Updated from pixel 3 to S22 ultra 2 months ago. Ever since, my Facebook continuously changes setting to begin videos w sound when scrolling. Every few hours to every couple of days I have to manually go in and change it back, I'm talking 10-20x per week. Only on this phone, not on ipads or any other device. Does anyone have any input as to why? It's driving me nuts! TIA	R
Device restarting randomly	"I am not sure why this keeps happening. I have a snapdragon 256GB S22U unlocked version. Bought it at release. I am not a heavy user. But my device hangs up and restarts randomly sometimeswhen I am listening to music and sometimes when I am watching youtube. I am still on the July update.
Is anyone else facing the issue? Or does anyone know what the issue is? Any inputs are highly appreciated"	R
S22+ slow net while on bluetooth	So I got an S22+ last month and I noticed that while using my galaxy buds pro I got with my mobile, my net is really slow. Like I can't download my WhatsApp pics or videos. Even calls show that it's reconnecting. Right after I switch off Bluetooth the pics and videos are downloaded. I tried this with my old galaxy buds + and still the same problem is there. Please help me	R
Have to restart to get cell signal - Verizon	I'm guessing it has nothing to do with Verizon. Wondering if anyone else has had this issue. Since I got the phone in April, half the time I leave home, I have no bars for cell signal. I have tried deleting network settings and that has not fixed the problem. The only thing that works is to restart the phone. Then I get signal.	R

s22 ultra lagging while charging	"Hey everyone, I've been playing with my new s22 ultra for some time now and I've noticed that it performs horribly while connected to the charger. Doesn't matter if it is on super fast or regular charging, I can barely use the phone during that time. The screen gets unresponsive, it lags, i tap on one thing and the phone opens up another one etc. 
What could be the reason for that and how can I fix this? 
Thanks"	R
S22 ultra battery is utter trash	My new snapdragon s22 ultra has had awful battery since the day I got it. It's just embarrassing for the most premium flagship.

September Update: Super Fast Charging problem	"Super Fast Charging
Before the recent September update, my phone was still charging with Super Fast Charge via the 25W Official Samsung charger. But after the update, my phone is just fast charging. I even tried changing cables, wiping cache, turning on the super fast charge in the battery settings, etc.
Any one know a fix for this? Cheers!"	R
Camera can't switch to 3x lens after late august firmware update.	"My S22 ultra is now unable to use 3x telephoto lens after late august firmware update. It's now using cropped 1x when selected 3x mode. This problem is not only on native camera app but also Gcam seems to be confuse which lens it is supposed to be used. (Gcam can use 3X but not 10x?? Wth)
How'd i know?
Terrible 3x zoom quality so I use my finger covers it while switching through each lens.
I also tested each camera lens through diagnostic code and it's like all camera len's ID have been swapped all over the places.
Model: SM-908E
Firmware: S908EXXU2AVH9
**Update : My camera is now working fine.**   
1. Clear data of the native camera apps.    
2. Restart the phone after step 1.    
*But overall I think lens switching has never been this aggressive before So I recommend to use Pro mode from now on whenever you wanted to zoom.*
##*Gcam still ruined even before the update it's working fine.*##"	R

S22 Ultra "vibrates" when I open the front facing camera on Tik Tok.	So every once and a while when I open the front facing camera on Tik Tok I hear a somewhat faint vibration and I think it's coming from the camera because when it happens, the image is blurry and shaky (like it's vibrating). The sound is almost like the idle sound of some sort of appliance. It stops after a few seconds, or when I close and reopen the camera part of TikTok, but it's really weird, it didn't start happening until recently. Has anyone else noticed this?	R

Secured Folder notification bug after August update	"I just installed the August update for my unlocked phone on AT&T. Now when i reboot my phone i will get a notification saying that you must unlock your Secure Folder in order to get notifications from apps  inside your Secure Folder.  
You cannot clear the notification and it will not go away till you unlock your Secure Folder.  
More importantly, you really will not get any notifications from any apps in your Secure Folder unless you do unlock the Secure Folder after reboot. Once you unlock the folder you can go in and out of your phone after that and notifications will come through. But the next time you reboot your phone though you have to unlock your Secure Folder in order to get any future notifications. 
Anyone else experiencing that bug? I feel that's kind of irritating that you're going to get a notification to unlock your Secure Folder every time you restart your phone and also the fact that you have to unlock your Secure Folder after restart to receive any future notifications from apps in your secured folder.  
I tested this by doing about a half a dozen reboots and if you don't unlock your Secure Folder after a reboot you do not get any notifications. But once you unlock your Secure Folder all the notifications start appearing. 
I have used Secure Folder since Note 8 and never did we have to do this after a reboot and I can't find any settings to enable/re-enable notifications from Secure Folder. Anyone else?"	R

Venting about S22Ultra	"I brought this phone last week, and I have mixed feelings about it. I don't have anyone to talk about phones in depth and I want to take this out. It's going to be long, and also maybe a little biased because I am upset. But I really need to write this. Don't take it too personally...
I have a Pocophone F1 since launch day, and I think it's the best phone I ever had. I brought it 4 years ago and it still works like new. Maybe the battery has resented a little, but it still lasts more than the S22 Ultra... 
I feel like I made a mistake buying this phone. I wanted to upgrade my F1 since I had the money, and just because that phone had 2 cons: No android 12 and no widevine L1, so streaming apps streamed up to 720p only. So I thought I'd give it a try... I want to cry and every time I look at my F1 I just want to go back... I feel like the only upgrade I got is a bigger screen... I know it's overall better but the improvements aren't that noticeable and I'm not sure it's worth it.
I have used the Poco F1 daily for many hours, and I game a lot (emulators, play store games...) so I spent hours playing weekly. I fear that will be impossible with the S22 Ultra. When I started writing this post it was 100% and now it dropped to 78% already... Guides say to turn off location and gps but I also have a smartwach and honeslty, I have to downgrade a 1200€ phone so it works worse than a MIUI? What's the point of having a high end phone if I can't use any feature? 
And the screen, I don't know what's wrong with my screen, I went through settings countless times, the colors look worse than the Poco F1. This phone seems to have like a yellowish tint, and whites are never fully white, and I searched this up and changed a lot of settings on the display settings. I also draw and I had troubles with the white tones because it's hard to tell them apart. I went to the store twice to get the screen protector changed thinking that could be the issue. 
And also the screen doesn't look very nitid/vivid compared to the F1. To get a similar look I have to swirch to the WQHD+ resolution, (twice the resolution as the F1, for the same look) which also drains the battery faster. I also think the fact that this phone doesn't have a true white screen makes it look less vivid/nitid. This is driving me crazy, ngl. 
I also have a Galaxy Watch 4 and the screen looks the same as the F1 (meaning: good, nitid, whites are white, not yellow or yellowish grey if using cool white balace)
I don't have a complain about anything else though... I have the 512gb version so I get a lot of storage and RAM , plus features like NFC that the Poco F1 didn't had. But is this worth it...? I really want to like this phone, but sometimes I feel so frustrated for wasting so much money to get a worse yellow screen. What's the point on making amazing photos when I have transfer them to another phone to see them correctly? 
My biggest issue seems to be the screen and that damn yellow tint... I have screen mode to Vivid, cool white balance, I also tried adjusting the RGB on advanced settings. No eye shield, no adaptative brightess. 
Because even if the battery isn't that good, it charges fast, so maybe it's not that bad to charge it twice daily for 30 mins instead of just once daily for 90mins. 
Although I have to say the GPS works really bad, I had to use it today and there was no way to make it work (I'm on latest patch it got updated aug 29), luckily I have the watch 4 LTE that saved me. 
I really wish and hope I can find a way to get the screen to look properly so I can enjoy this phone and write an even longer post about the good things it has. 
At least I feel better taking this out of my chest."	R
S22 poor light from front camera.	"So the issue that I've been observing is with my phones front camera. Usually when I open the front camera or during messenger or whatsapp video calls, in dark or dimmed lit environments, I can barely see myself and thats the same for other people as well.

Verizon update 8 (August) broke our phones	"All, 
Just reporting here that verizon update 8 seems to have broken my s22u, and my wife's s22+.   Symptoms are that people we are talking to cannot hear us, or choppy.   Text messages don't always come through.   Reboot the phone, and they all come. 
Already tried clearing cache, factory reset, then called vzw support,  they reset network settings.  Problem occurs on wifi, network extender, and in other locations(not home, or anywhere near home). 
Vzw thought my phone was bad, and are sending me replacement under warranty, my wifes phone was fine, but then overnight my wife's s22+ got the update 8, and now her phone has same problems.  
Sometimes a reboot allows my phone to work for a few hours, then goes bad, other times a reboot makes no difference. 
Now am researching Odin, and reloading update 7. 
Any others seen this?"	R

Something is not right here	Contacted T-Mobile today. Discussed sparking charger and phone issues. Was informed that even though I had insurance, I had to prove it was defective. Was sent to a third party Samsung Equipment company. Was told I had to reset the phone to their settings because if these problems were really happening, it had to be some setting I had changed. Huh? Are you saying that if I pick the wrong setting, I can make a charger spark when I plug it in? Was informed they could not test my charger without having the phone at the right settings. Should I interpret that to mean that Samsung has created a phone that will not work properly if I select some settings that break a charger and make the phone not work? Because if I cannot use them, then why are they there? No, I told them, the charger sparked multiple times. I don't care if that is considered defective or not, it happened and I shouldn't be expected to keep it because it has proven itself to be a shocking hazard. I jumped when it happened. Various electrical equipment has used that outlet many times, including a charging Note 4, with no sparking. I've spent the last few weeks learning about the phone and selecting a layout and settings that I like. When I tell you that it does not tell me how long it's going to take to recharge the phone because it used to have that information and now, after the sparking, it doesn't, then please tell me what the setting should be because I'm still following the same video and the settings in it, which worked before and not now. Samsung Equipment wouldn't tell me. I told him I had to go out and would return later. He sent me a text to reply to in order to get his attention so we could do the testing. He never replied when I did that. I sent a text asking for a document telling me the "proper" settings to use and I would change them myself. That way, I'd know exactly what setting I had liked so I could return to it when the testing was over. He never replied. Still hasn't. It sparked. Period. Take it back and test it yourself and give me one that works, T-Mobile. You keep sending me messages that you're glad I'm a new customer. Prove it. We have a contract.	R

Snapchat crashes everytime I press Log in?	"So I actually have the S22plus, though there are more active members here. When I first got my phone I was able ho download and sign into my snap account with no issue. Though the only problem was I never got notifications even though it said they were on. 
I recently went onto the app and nothing was loading so I ended up uninstalling the app. Only to realize I forgot my wifi was off. So I re-installed the app and when I try to sign in with my account everytime I press login the app crashes. I can't log in without it crashing. I tried resetting my phone, I downloaded a new phone update, I gave and removed all permissions. I have also cleared the cache and data multiple times. 
I think the issue could be either from a third party app, or a setting I accidentally set. I don't think it is an issue with snapchat itself because I was able to download it on my old iPhone and sign in just fine. Any advice? Thanks."	R

video messaging sending blurry	"Hello!
I recently upgraded from the S20 Ultra to the S22 Ultra, but have never been able to send a video message clearly. After the video has sent, it shows super blurry on my screen in the chat and the person who I sent it to. I've had the problem since joining Tmobile. I wasn't even able to send a video to my boyfriend who is on the same mobile plan and had the same phone. 
I've been using the Google messaging app that came on the phone, and some other generic messaging app. Neither of them work. 
Stopped into a Tmobile today because it *has* to be a setting somewhere, right? Well they suggested I send my phone back to Samsung for them to fix it, although I told them it's been happening well before I got this particular phone. The Tmobile employee didn't bother to look at any settings, so I'm hoping the all knowing beings of Reddit can assist. 
Thanks ✨️"	R
is anyone else's 128/8 not running very poorly?	"I've had an SD 128/8 now for about half a year now. It's fine for light tasks, but if I do a video call or something, I can barely use any other apps, even reddit. It heats up very very quickly, all apps become super laggy and even the home screen refresh rate goes below 60hz.
The maim problem though is the cellular connection is HORRIBLE. I still have my note 20 ultra, which I never had any cellular issues with. There are many places which got great reception with the N20U, which my S22U only gets 1 bar or completely loses signal. Just to test it out I went to one of those places with both phones. Using the same sim card. The N20U worked fine but the S22U still failed. I was at the mall with my girlfriend the other day, she has a 4 year old iPhone XS, we were below ground level but she had a connection no problem, was browsing just fine, I couldn't even get a web page to open.
Oh yes and the CAMERA LAG. Even if the phone is stone cold, the camera will sometimes lag very bad. Most of my videos I need to start filming a few seconds after I hit record, because the first 3 seconds is just stuttering...
I have already taken it to a Samsung store, the service rep ran the diagnostic, and said ""since the diagnostic said there is no problems with the phone, there is nothing we can do"".
So I did a video call in front of him, gave him the phone, he used it, even just swiping on the home screen he admitted he could see that the refresh rate is way too low and should not be like that.
All he said is ""you can delete everything and Factory reset""...
I really don't know what to do anymore... anyone else have a similar experience with the 128/8 model?
I am starting to think that it is because of the lower ram, as no one else with 12gb ram has these issues."	R
Yellow Charger Warning on Brand new S22 Ultra? It just arrived. I was surprised that it does not ship with a charger. Using my old charger (Anker USB-C for S10+) get's the yellow triangle?	"It's basically all in the title.  
I was very excited when the phone arrived, and immediately confused and shocked to find there's no charging adapter.   
I'm currently using an s10+, the charging cable is an Anker cable plugged into the official Samsung adapter.  I figured that should work.   
But I get [This exact warning (not my photo)](https://preview.redd.it/o5t1mso431b61.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9094bca39d0d6d33ed8310b458c9c329d08296a3) when I plug that charger in. Immediate alarm bells, given that it's literally a brand new phone.  
But I've tried charging it with someone else cable, and the warning doesn't show. If I use the USB-c - USB-C cable provided, no warning. I'm currently charging the phone with my Macbook Pro charger and it's absolutely fine.  
So should I be concerned about the issue with my older charger?"	R

Strange battery problem when charge is low	"I've had my S22 Ultra for about 4 months. In general the battery life is OK for my use - not great, but fine.
But it has 2 problems and I'm not sure if these are specific to my phone or if they're all like this:
1. When the charge gets to around 10-15% it starts dropping very quickly. Even with the phone in standby, it'll go from 15-10 in about 20 minutes, then from 10-5 in about 10 minutes, and from 5 to 0 in less than one minute! If I ever notice that the charge is at around 5%, I literally don't have enough time to go plug it in.
2. If it goes flat and turns itself off, then when I plug it in it doesn't actually start charging for at least 20 minutes. It shows the ""charging circle"" but without a number in it. After about 20 minutes, it shows 1% and then starts going up and charging normally. During those 20 minutes I can't turn it on even though it's plugged in. I've tried all sorts of cables and chargers - it's the same regardless.

Connection Issues	I recently bought a Samsung S22 and for the last couple of days now I have started to see issues with the network connection (Not Wifi). I will see 3 or 4 bars that show signal strength with 4 or 5G, but when I go to open an app like TikTok, Facebook, or even Google Chrome the app just keeps loading like it isnt connected to the network. It seems like if I wait it out things start to work again after some time. At first I thought it may be an issue with the phone trying to switch from 5G to 4G but now I'm not so sure. I wanted to check to see if anyone else is having this issue?	R
custom ringtone problem	Just got my galaxy s22. I did the transfer from my s10. Everything worked perfectly there and the transfer seemed to go smoothly. My custom ringtones that I created tranferred and were in the ringtone folder. (Yay!) The assigned ringtones were not assigned in my contacts on the new phone so I added some of them and of those I added some work. At least two of them do not work. The ringtones played when I selected them, so I know that's not the problem. But when the phone rings, it goes to the default ringtone and not the assigned one for these contacts. The default is also a custom ringtone I created. I even tried selecting a new ringtone for these contacts, still get the default. Any ideas how to fix it? It doesn't make sense, some work others don't.	R

Question about problem is with S22 Ultra. Anyone else??	"My wife and I are Verizon, I got an S22 Ultra the day it released and haven't had any issues. My wife just got a brand new one, upgrading from a Google Pixel 5, and she is having issues with her Messaging app, the default one (not the Samsung one). It takes forever to load, and then when everything shows up, if you click on a conversation it just shows blank. She had to default it over to the Samsung app, which sucks because we like the little ""read"" ""sent"", reacting either emojis, etc.
I have tried going into the app, force stopping, clearing cache, uninstalling and reinstalling all updates, only to have the same result. This surely couldn't be a hardware issue right? Has this happened to anyone else? Thanks everyone for your time!"	R
Not receiving iphone messages?	"I recently had an update for my Verizon S22 ultra and ever since then I am unable to get Iphone messages but they can get mine. Is anyone else having this issue?
Edit: I checked to see if there were anymore updates available and there was one. After updating again my phone works good now! Thanks for your help everyone."	R
s22 ultra camera too much sharpening	"When I shoot pictures of my drawings and sometimes just normal selfies, a white halo appears around everything and looks way too sharp. I can't edit the photo in post to reduce the noise because the slider is all the way at the left.
When I take a snap of a video the sharpening isn't there. And in the picture preview it's totally fine. It's only after taking the picture. Letting it do its processing after 5 seconds that it adds the sharpening.
I remember seeing a setting that way like, take picture of preview, with no added processing but I can't find that anymore? Can anyone give assistance on how to control the post processing?"	R
Edge lighting	Can't get it to work. Have it set "brief", edge lighting style set to glow, "show even while screen is off" . Messages+ and Phone are turned on and still not working?	R
Screen goes black immediately during call	"Hello, my screen goes black immediately during call - making one or receiving. i have to turn it on/off manually with button. I have tried in Samsung Members to test proximity sensor but since the screen goes black immediately even without covering the sensor the test says that sensor is Ok. I restart my phone, it works again for a day, then again and again proximity has stopped working. Only when I point a screen to the sky, it does not turn off the screen. Like a huge ammount of light is required not to turn off my screen. Looks like a SW issue to me. Anyone experience same issue? Should I hard reset my phone, will it help or wait for some update? Thx
current sw: AVH9
(sorry for my english)"	R
anyone else getting super grainy, low quality photos out of the box? I've had the phone for just over a week now, and the only setting I've changed on the camera is the resolution. I've tried every resolution and they all turn out grainy and blurry. I've also noticed the shutter speed is super slow.		R
Bixby Routines: NFC on when Wallet app is open, not working	"I wanted to create a Bixby Routine that turns on NFC if I open the Google Wallet App and then turns it off again when I'm done.
It's just not working. Before I even set it up with Tasker (I'm just not used to Samsung having its own version of that), the NFC toggle tasks work if I run them manually, but the profile that is supposed to recognize the wallet app also does nothing.
Why?"	R
Whatsapp proximity sensor for voice messages not working while Galaxy Watch 5 pro is paired	"Hey

When i disable the calls for my watch 5 from settings - Bluetooth.. it works properly (but i cannot use my watch to make / answer calls.
Any idea for issue resolution / solution

amazon echo auto	Ever since I upgraded my phone my Amazon echo auto is having an issue skipping. Any sounds that come from my phone (notifications, music, driving instructions) playing through the echo skip occasionally. The only way to correct it is to unplug the echo and restart it. My old phone (Samsung s10) didn't have this issue and l but my brother also upgraded his phone to the s22 ultra and has the same problem. Anyone else with the same issue or potential fix?	R
S22: Player Does Not Recognize File	I just got the Galaxy S22. All my files & apps were transfered over from a Note 9. The player on my S22 does not recognize the Note 9 ring tone files. What can I do to get them to work on my S22?	R
Rotate button gone and can't rotate youtube video	I just noticed my button that lets me rotate the screen, that pops up when i view a picture and tilt my phone is gone. Also when i watch a youtube video and rotate the screen 180 the video doesn't rotate, too. Some days ago it still did. Anyone had this problem too and knows a fix or why this happens?	R
Painfully slow??	"Am I the only one that feels like the s22u is ridiculously slow to load things? 
I'm on Verizon and if I have anything less than full 4g lte it feels like I'm back on dial up. Maps? Good luck. Streaming? Not gonna happen. Downloads? Not today. Oh and roaming, A LOT. Which my other phone never did.
My wife has a s22+, we can be side by side and hers is leaps and bounds faster.
I never had these problems in the same areas with my note 10+. Did I get a dud?"	R
Yelp?	So my phone has been randomly opening yelp after the last update mostly after the daily restart but it just did it when I had the phone down for maybe an hour? 128 Sap	R
s22 ultra slow on internet speed	So every devices in my house are getting around 60 to 65 mbps download and 10 mbps upload meanwhile my s22 ultra can barely get 10 mbps download and barely any upload anyone know what it could be the phone also likes to restart by itself once in a while im starting to regret this phone	R
Texts not coming through	"In the last week I've noticed I'm  not getting texts from people I usually talk to multiple times daily. I do a restart and 50 texts come through out of nowhere. Everyone asking if I'm okay, giving me important info, etc. 
Anyone having this issue? I'm using the Samsung messages app if that helps. This is completely frustrating!"	R

Google Messages dual sim MMS.	"I'm having an issue with MMS in Google Messages. I have my personal sim (Verizon) and my work e-sim (Verizon) in my S22 Ultra with the personal sim set as primary.  
With Google Messages it says I need to switch Sims before I can send or receive MMS messages. If I switch to Samsung Messages it works perfectly without having to switch the primary sim. 
Has anyone else seen this and have you been able to figure it out?"	R
Not receiving messages...	"Hey all - hoping you can maybe help me out with this (it most likely has been posted before)...
There are times where my phone (S22 Ultra+) won't receive text messages until I restart my phone. I believe that I can still send messages though. Is there any fix to this? I don't even know if I'm missing messages until my husband tells me that he texted me and I never replied back."	R
Notifications not clearing themselves	"Hey guys! When I receive a notification, say Instagram, I open the app and visualize whatever it is that came as a notification, it still remains on my Notification Center, it only goes away when I clear it manually.

What can I do?"	R
Please if anyone can check this: go to contacts, press any contact and then press and hold call button and then this menu should pop-up which will let you choose a SIM card by which you want to make a call. Now. My both SIMs have phone numbers in them but for some reason only SIM 2 is only showing		R
Really poor camera quality compared to the basic S21.	I switched to the S22 Ultra from my S21 a few days ago. I noticed that the camera quality, especially in dimmer places was pretty bad for some reason, so I compared the two phones side by side and it's not even funny how much better the S21 did on both the wide lens and on 64mp vs 108mp. The S22 photos are really choppy, got a lot of green/pink artifacts around objects, it can't even focus properly and the colors are off ( way worse than on the S21 ). The only place where the S22 performed better is outside, when it gets as sunny as it could be, but even then, the difference isn't that obvious. This problem only seems to be on the wide lens, the 3x and 10x are performing as they should ( hopefully ) . I tried everything from cleaning camera cache to factory resetting the phone but nothing works . I believe it might have something to do with the fact that the phone is locked on Verizon and the phone is getting updates through them.	R
S22 IR Photography	I recently tried taking a photo on my S22 Ultra using an IR high pass filter. I was surprised to see that my camera only saw a black image. I have used the same filter with an S9 and an iPhone 11 and gotten pretty good IR photos. For some reason the S22 Ultra isn't seeing anything on any of the 4 rear face cameras. Does anyone know if Samsung seriously upgraded the IR low pass filter on all four cameras or if there was any reason why the S22 couldn't take an IR photograph?	R

Cannot connect 2 phones at the same time to S22 Hotspot	"Is anyone in here experienced the issue with S22

Delayed and multiple notifications	Ok so i have spent hours if not days online trying to find a fix for this issue. For the last couple months I have been getting delayed notifications for apps like Twitter, Instagram and random apps sometimes. Sometimes I get my bank notifications like 5 times within a couple hours when I should have only gotten 1. I have tried everything from restarting, battery optimization, killing apps, leaving them open, you name it! Please I need some help here because it's driving me nuts. Tmobile carrier if that matters.	R
please advise	"Hi,
I was having freezing issues with my s22 ultra. I went through Verizon first and basically the lady and the store tried to get me to do a replacement through Ausrian. I just got the phone June 30. I didn't want a refurbished pile of junk that they are known to send. I then went to a samung repair place certified through samsung and had them do a diagnostic and a flash to put the operating system fresh on phone. After multiple times of troubleshooting the phone was still freezing and lagging. So I called Verizon again and the rep told me to call samsung. I called Samsung and basically was told I had to send the phone in to them and be without a phone for 5-7 days, gave up on that after speaking to management and not getting anywhere either. Finally called verizon again and got in contact with tier one tech, guy from tier one sent me to tier 2 due to the issues with phone, tier 2 then got me with someone higher up and she shared with me you can do the warranty replacement through verizon directly that works with Samsung. So basically she placed an order for no charge for a certified like new s22 ultra that I guess they get from samsung and then it's inspected a 2nd time by verizon. That being said it's going to be here Monday and I just have to send my junky phone in to them in a box they provide when you get the new replacement, so doing it that way I'm not without a phone.
It took so many people at verizon to finally tell me you can do the warranty replacement directly through verizon and not samsungs crappy way. I'm glad I waited because initially the girl the first time I went into verizon wanted me to file it through insurance which I stated above and didn't go along with because I wanted to check all my resources.
Basically I am never buying another samsing phone, they suck for replacement or fixing compared to Apple.
Does anyone or has anyone had thus issue with Samsung, Verizon or the s22 ultra??
Thanks"	R

Edge lightning Whatsapp	"Hello i was hoping someone could help me out with my question about the Samsung Galaxy S22:
On my s10 I had a nice edge lightning notification when I get a whatsapp message. Now the s22 also has an Edge lightning function, but that does not work for whatsapp. However it does work when I get a text message (so not whatsapp). 
I have enabled whatsapp in my settings, but it still just doesn't work.. i tried so many things, but it just doesn't seem to work for me
Anyone an idea what to do? I just want to be able to see if I get whatsapp message when I have the phone on the table.

Camera controller does not work Watch 5 pro + S22 ultra.		R
Watch5 Pro (GW5P) constantly disconnecting from S22 phone	"Update 1: Almost 24 hrs later and no unexpected disconnections, nor has SAS been reinstalled. This leads me to believe there is, at a minimum, a conflict between Galaxy Fit era accessories and GW5P. Since SAS has not been reinstalled, not even available for this 'accessory' on Play Store, and everything is working smoothly on the watch, I would say it's only used for previous accessory models.
Since purchasing my Watch5 Pro a few weeks back, it's been constantly disconnecting the BT connection with my phone. I've been tracking the disconnects with Tasker, and notice no disconnections when it's charging. I've completely deleted Wear-related from my phone, reset watch and started over.
May I also note, I did not have this issue with my previous Active2 watch.
Other than when charging, I could not find the culprit, until... I came across an article that suggested, among other things, to clear the cache from Samsung Accessory Service.
On a whim, I cleared the data on it and actually uninstalled it. Interestingly, I had no disconnects for about an hour, which was highly unusual. All of a sudden, the disconnects started to occur again and wouldn't you know it, The OS auto-installed Samsung Accessory Service back onto my phone. By default, it's not battery optimized.
Next steps... I also have my Galaxy Fit connected for tracking sleep. I'll remove that 'accessory', uninstall Samsung Accessory Service and see what happens.
Edit 1: I do not lose BT connection with my wireless earbuds for music. I've used them continuously for 2+ hours w/o disconnection.
Edit 2: I use Tasker's AutoWear plugin... it does not lose connection, though I can actually use it's commands w/o a BT connection."	R
Auto rotate not working s22+	I recently received an update for the phone and now my auto rotate doesn't work. Auto rotate is enabled, I have tried a factor reset, I have gone through diagnostics and the accelerometer passes. I'm at a loss. What can I do to fix this?	R
Is it 5% = 0% for anyone else?	"As soon as my phone hits 5% I have about 60 seconds to find a charger or the phones dies. Turning on battery saver maybe gets me an additional 60 seconds. Does anyone else have this issue? Battery life isn't bad when at 6% - 100%
Edit: Snapdragon"	R
Texts to one specific person not going through.	Texting to my girlfriend (shes on S22) randomly stopped working today. Texts to everyone else go through just fine. Tried resetting, clearing cache, all that, no dice. Anyone had anything like this, and did you find a solution? Thanks.	R
35w Dual port Samsung brand charger charging slowly.	"It says on my phone Super Fast Charging is active but it took 2 hours to charge it 60%? Not sure why. I just bought this Samsung branded 35w dual port charger. Using only 1 port it should be charging 35w but it's really slow. Any ideas why that might be? I figured it if it runs 25w for my phone it should still be pretty quick but it charges slower than the C port on my laptop charges the phone. 
[35W Power Adapter Duo Mobile Accessories - EP-TA220NBEGUS | Samsung US](https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/mobile-accessories/phones/35w-power-adapter-duo-ep-ta220nbegus/)
&amp;#x200B;
I downloaded accubattery and the results I got were this. 
35w charger C port: 17w at max (Super fast charging active)
35w charger A port: 7w charging (fast charging active)
Old Samsung car charger A port: 5w max (fast charging active)
Laptop USB C port: .3w cable charging. 
If you doubled these values it would seem more accurate. So I'm not sure why it's taking so long to reach the charge. It'll say 20 minutes but take closer to 40. "	R
Brightness Increases With Some Video	"Anyone else experiencing this?
Adaptive brigtnness is switched off
Video Brightness set to Normal.
Seems like this started happening after 2 or 3 security patches ago. It was doing it during Youtube, but stopped. 
However now was just scrolling Tumblr and it did it on there. It also has done it in the recent paat when watching jusf aome embedded video on a website.
Like it literally spikes brightness to the max, its such a waste. Especially if you're in a dim room. Its got to be a bug."	R
Nighttime videos and pictures are disappointing	I can't record any sort of night time video without it having a bunch of noise. I have to lower the brightness just to reduce it. Same for pictures. It's a shame since it's something the S22 was hailed by Samsung for in marketing.	R
Screen stays unlocked after a missed or unanswered call	"Not sure why this happens - but I can recreate the problem without fail.  Happens on both a regular S21 as well as an S22 Ultra - so im inclined to think its a software thing and not hardware.
Whenever someone calls me and I don't decline the call, answer it, basically - do nothing - as soon as the phone is done ringing - it will be left at the main screen, unlocked.  So frustrating, especially when the phone is in my pocket - because then I will go an hour or two with an unlocked phone in my pocket which randomly is opening apps etc. not to mention battery drain from screen being on.
Anything I am missing here?  Anyone else experience this?  
The only solution that I know of is to make sure I decline or answer the call..  letting it ring will always leave the screen on/unlocked state without any intervention."	R
No ring notification.	"This has happened only a few times, Yet annoying. Just happened a few minutes ago. Scenerio. On the phone with someone, calls drops for whatever reason on there end, they call right back and there is no way for me to pick it up. No notification, nothing, just a ringing phone with no visible indication to pick up call. 
These are calls from priority numbers with no blocking, etc activated. 
So annoyjong. Has anyone experienced this before.?"	R
Are network problems common with the S22u ?	I have had this phone since released. Everything has been fine until one week ago I just constantly have no signal/5g/internet. I went to my provider and they replaced the sim card. Worked for 5 minutes and then the same thing. I went back and they basically said there's nothing they can do and to contact Samsung. I have no clue what to do now	R

Photoloss on a S22+	"Hi guys !
Today I noticed something strange. After opening the Gallery App I found out that a lot of albums are missing. I opened the All-Pictures Tab and found out that some of the pics from the missing albums were there, but some were not. Not just that, but all the third-party apps like Messenger, Viber, MC Teams etc. seem to not find the majority of the pics ( to understand what I am saying, I have approximately 2k pics and messenger can find only 88 of them). 
I tried some stuff that the Internet recommends like clearing the cache, rebooting, using a tool-kit recovery app via a PC, reinstalling almost everything that has something to do with my files, yet nothing seems to work. 
The sad thing is that I don't even know what is gone and what is not + most of the pics are either university- or family - related, so you can imagine how sad I am atm. 
If any of you has a single idea, please share it.
Thanks in advance guys."	R

Anyone else have constant issues with Android auto disconnecting?	"I've done so many steps to ensure it's not my car, wire, etc. It seems like some Android auto updates make it constantly disconnect/reconnect and other updates fix it for the time being.

SMS messages stop arriving unless restart. Anybody else?	"####Problem Description
Every 2 days or so, my phone ceases receiving incoming SMS texts. Outgoing works, incoming stops. I usually don't notice for about 12 hours or someone asks me why I'm not answering. 
On a device reboot, I get a flood of 50 texts all cached on Verizon's backend.
####Device Details
Verizon wireless. Unlocked S22 Ultra. Wifi calling and texts is on. Toggling airplane mode on and off to force cell tower reacquisition doesn't work. Using Google Messenges app, which worked fine on previous phones. 
Haven't ever had this problem before, just upgraded from Ye Olde Grandfathered Unlimited plan to the new 5G Get Everything plan (tm). 
####Troubleshooting
Replaced the SIM card, and reprovisioned to the internal eSim. 
Even had Verizon reset my account in the backend on their Messenging Center in case of any provisioning issues. 
Yet this persists. Why? Anybody else?"	R

Reddit sucks on this beautiful screen	Hello Guys, after more than a long time using ios switched to S22 ultra. And I'm enjoying it.

Screen share won’t work	"Trying to connect to my Samsung Qn90b, it does register my phone as a connected device but if I’ll try mirror my phone through the quick settings nothing happens, and even through the smart things app where it does see my phone, when I click on the mirror option it won’t do anything besides to display the “connecting to…” message endlessly.

Spotify Songs Not Displaying in Car	"I've recently upgraded from the s10+ to the s22 ultra. I drive a 2017 Honda Civic.

I can hit pause/play on my car screen and it will work, although the buttons won't change with what the music is doing. 
Any ideas in how to fix this? It's pretty annoying not being able to see what song is playing on my car screen."	R
Bluetooth turning on after restart / Spotify (or media control) trying to auto play.	"Hey everyone,
As the title suggests, I have my device set to auto restart at 3am, just for cache clearing etc. But, at some point randomly each morning (after the reboot) it will turn on bluetooth, then either Spotify or media control tries to do...something. 
It's like it is trying to play on some device, but here's what I've done to try to stop that from happening.
Cleared bluetooth and Spotify cache. Cleared any paired devices.
Checked every possible option I can think of in Spotify.
Turned off or disabled every possible option I can think of relating to auto play, auto connect, neaby devices / scanning.
Checked and changed any Google Home assistant settings related to music and location automation. 
Turned off quick sharing, nearby sharing options. 
There's probably more that I can't remember, I've been trying to solve this for days.
&amp;nbsp;
It seems like Music Share is the culprit, but I've turned it off, and anything I can find even remotely related to it. So far the only solutions I have are uninstalling Spotify or not auto rebooting. Of course they are plausible temporarily, but long term I should be able to use the device as intended without it taking over.
&amp;nbsp;
It's probably an easy fix, an option worded in an odd way I may have missed or something. Has anyone encountered this problem before and know of a solution.
Thanks in advance, feel free to ask for more info if I haven't provided enough."	R

Shows when the screen is off and everything for her, but not me. 
It's driving me crazy because I can't seem to figure out why it won't work. I have the s22+. Is there something I'm missing? Notifications aren't hidden, and it's set to show when screen is off/locked. So frustrating. I've gone through all the settings and everything is as it should be. Did android 12 screw it up somehow?"

asking Help / Suggestions	My s22 ultra's cellular+wifi connection suddenly stop working properly. It gets connected - disconnected continuously. Like, two min on 5g, then no network, then lte, then no network, like these all the time. I did ui 5 beta, rolled back stable, then beta 3. Same. What i can do? What might be the reason? I can do warranty claim from Samsung but I'm too lazy for that, instead i will keep this off untill next trade in on February as i have other phones. My, question is, what might be reason for this suddenly?	R

The fingerprint reader isn't great	The first challenge is that you can only register 4 fingerprints. The second, I would say it takes at least 2 tries every time I unlock and I have to renew my prints every month or accuracy will start to drop off more.

Google pay issue	"So I've been using the S22u since release. I bought brand new for me and my girlfriend. Had no issues with Google pay, until about 3 days ago... I went to the vending machine in my apartment to get us both a drink, tapped once, it worked. Tapped again for the second drink, and suddenly my device doesn't meet security requirements. I've used it many times at this location and many others, never had this happen. 
Then I tried with my gfs phone, worked once then just stopped working.
I uninstalled, cleared cache, restarted my phone, uninstalled and reinstalled Google play services 
No clue why this happened and out of nowhere, and on both phones."	R
Google pay tap very inconsistent.	"I'm just new from iPhone and its tap to pay was great

At first I was always opening the Google pay app and then I was told no need to

my s22 ultra keeps crashing youtube after 40mins of usage what do I do?	This problem started when I got the regular s22 and transferred my data from my old s10e to the s22. Youtube would be fine until I used it for more than 45mins where it starts lagging uncontrollably, freezes and returns to the home screen or the app screen. Then I transferred the data to an s22 ultra and it still gives me this problem even after a factory reset and back up restore. What should I do?	R

10x telephoto lens crack noise	"Hi everyone, 
I wanted to take a 10x zoom photo today.  I held the phone horizontally (it's happening only in this position) , set the 10x zoom and heard the gentle sound of the stabilization turning on and setting the lenses in the correct position.  Then I went back to 1x and there is a loud sound as the stabilization of the 10x lens turns off and you can even feel the vibration.  I'm sure the phone didn't do this before.  
I know that if I'm not using the camera, the lenses are not stabilized and make a sound when I move the phone, but this is new to me.  I have had the phone since the first wave of sales.
Has anyone encountered this?"	R

Leaving Samsung after 12 years	I've been loyal to Samsung phones since the first Galaxy S in 2010. It's time to move on. Unplugged my phone 3 hours ago and I am at 67% battery with only 1 hour and 10 minutes of screen on time. That's pathetic. I hate so much to leave but I've tried everything including not 1 but 2 factory reset and even turned everything down or off that is recommended (although it's sad that you should have to do that. I don't know what I will move on to, but so long Samsung.	R
Mobile data icon dissappears when location is enabled.	"So I have been noticing that my mobile data icon dissappears everytime I enable location. It appears again after I turn off and on mobile data but, it's really annoying to have it dissappear every 20-30mins. I thought quickstar was the culprit and disabled it but, the issue still persist. Restarting and clearing phone cache also did not resolve the issue. It's been like this since the June update but now it occurs more often compared to before.
Has anyone experienced the same issue? I have the base S22 Snapdragon."	R
Getting no notification or vibration when screen is off.	I have notifications enabled on the lock screen. If the screen is unlocked or if the screen is on I get notifications and vibration.

Scene Optimizer gone MIA with latest update	Anyone else noticed that the Scene Optimizer is 'gone' from the camera in the new update? You can activate the feature, and it seems to be doing some optimizing, but before, if it was doing it, you'd see an icon at the bottom of the screen (dog for pets, mountain for landscape, moon for night, etc.)... Now that icon doesn't show up, and it was kinda useful because it let you turn the scene off for that particular shot.	R
Upload speeds	"I live out in the sticks and don't get a  strong signal. I initially contacted Verizon about people complaining about me breaking up during calls. The agent said if I upgraded my line from 5g start to 5g play more plan I would get a stronger signal. I did yesterday and it went from 1 bar to 2. My phone is usually on 4g but sometimes switches to 5g. My download speeds are ok but upload speeds are almost nothing. I'm usually on wifi at home and speeds are OK, but when I turn wifi off upload is terrible. 
It looks like my ISP is running fiber optics down my road in the future so if I stay on wifi I'll be OK.
Just wondering what is going on with my upload speeds and does Verizon offer some kind of home signal booster.
Attached is a screenshot of speed tests."	R
What keeps auto-adjusting background volume?	"For the past week or two, sometimes when I watch a video  while wearing my Samsung Buds+, I can *notice* background audio wildly adjusting up and down randomly when it detects someone talking. I have no idea what could be causing this, and it's not consistent.
I even tried screen recording the fluctuations of background audio when playing a video, but the recording did not pick it up when when it occurred. There's gotta be some setting I need to change, since I could also hear it from the speakers too. 
When playing back parts of a video that did it, it sometimes lowers background audio, sometimes not. This inconsistency is driving me up a wall and I cannot figure out what or where it's causing this. Has anyone else experienced  this?"	R

Have the Replacement Now	"Different problems and I'm wishing I had kept the first. I waited until the last minute. There were 2 updates and after each, it acted up again but then it settled down. I traded it in because my time was up and there were still issues but so many had disappeared .. now I have a new phone. Store said they couldn't guarantee it was brand new. Maybe that's my problem.   
Very random and very unreliable. Settings are all different. I didn't change them; it's how they arrived. These updates have messed it up, too, only it hasn't fixed itself like it appears the first one did. It's so problematic that I'm about to do a restore.  Or maybe I'll set it back to factory (I'm not sure it came that way) and begin over. I can still restore it later, can't I? Or should I restore it and if the problems are still there, then return to factory setting? 
Here's what happened today. I cannot click on an icon and select Add to Home - most of the time, but when it finally does move, it goes to the last page, which is not Home and there's plenty of room on the other screens. I just tried it again but first clicked Select then Add to Home. It went to Home, but it pushed an icon on the bottom row out of the way and put itself there. I've never had to click Select first before right now and that's very awkward because when I pick my finger off the screen to select Add to Home, the checkmark on Select goes away and it's like I never did it. The first phone never had a problem. Often I just reboot to see if that will help. I shouldn't have to do that. I've had the phone for a week and this was never a problem until today. 
Touch Screen Sensitivity is ON. Worked for a while. Now it usually doesn't, not even with the S-[pen.](https://s-pen.So)  Now  Just turned it off and back on and it's working. I tried that all day and it never worked, rebooted, etc. So I just tried adding the same icon to Home again. It worked - but it went to the 4th screen. That's a new one.  There's either a ghost here or the phone is playing games with me. Or maybe - all the grids have 4 in a row except the bottom row, which has 5. Maybe somebody didn't teach it how to count. 
Last one - I have an app in Never sleeping apps. Has to do that because the battery causes problems and it doesn't sync with the time if it's asleep. But when I have Auto optimize daily on, it takes it out of the never sleeping setting ! So now I have to have put Auto optimize daily off because otherwise the app will get pulled out. I'll have to optimize manually. That didn't happen with the first phone; it worked perfectly.
Sometimes if I'm doing something with an icon, it disappears."	R

Speaker problems with flight pressure / cold temperatures	My phone started having issues with it's speaker after a bunch of flying recently. When searching online, all I could find was a bunch of old threads of people having the same issue when either flying or exposing their phone to temperature changes. The only reported fix people have is to pop out the sim card tray and supposedly that helps (which seems absurd, how is a flagship phone's solution to pop out the sim tray each time you fly or get in cold weather). Does anyone know if there are any updated solutions to the problem? Or have people had any good luck requesting warranty fixes through UbreakIfix it? Just looking for any updated information since the last threads I can see are from a couple of months ago.	R
Problems with S22 when in Facebook	My husband is having this problem on his \[relatively new\] S22 when using it in Facebook.

Screen Bleed or Dynamic Island?	"My S22 Ultra has a growing bubble around the front camera, trying to create its own dynamic island I guess.

It's not damaged, but appears to have failed at the camera cutout.

The Samsung site doesn't really cover this, it's automated and either broken or not. Has anyone seen this, and had it covered under warranty?

S22 Ultra Slower Charging On October Update	I just got the October update on my Verizon S22 Ultra. Charging speeds have definitely decreased.

I managed to capture a strange screen flickering. In this video - just a small bar (and only visible when scrolling).

This happens only when the Power saving is ON (in my case - automatically if battery goes below 25%).  
Turn Power saving off and it goes away.

Apple USB C to 3.5mm dongle not working	"Hey yall. I just purchased an apple usb-c to 3.5mm dongle and have attempted to use it with multiple earbuds on my s22, with no success.  I know this adapter has a DAC and has worked for other people.

Notification sounds interrupt music or videos	"Hello

AT&amp;T Galaxy S22 Visual Voicemail	"The Visual Voicemail Application on my Galaxy S22 is not great. I don't know if it AT&amp;T or Samsung that makes it but it is bad.

Sometimes it sits on ""Refreshing..."" I also wished that it had Voicemail Transcriptions.

Is there any app that may add an overlay that can let me tweak the screens color settings?
I remember the Nexus 6P had a Developer Option you could change to SRGb and it would seem to alleviate the vibrance a little.

It would be great if I could tweak it a little more.

Heartbreak	"TL;DR: Long time samsung user having another horrible experience, resale value is horrible, Unfortunately back to Iphone I go. 
The Galaxy Note 3 was the phone that really drew my attention to the Note world but I didnt start off until the Galaxy Note 8 came out. After that I switched to The note 9, 10plus, 20 ultra and now the S22Ultra. I'm glad Samsung dropped the Note name because this S22Ultra does not deserve that title. I never expected a phone with the specs this thing has to take 8 seconds everytime I needed to open the camera within an app? Absolutely lag when switching out of multi-window? just randomly struggle when trying to open apps? Get embarrassed by my friends Old galaxyS20+? Etc... 
My trip to apples pro max lineup was supposed to be short and bitter but I realized that they aren't as bad as I thought. I was just a samsung fan boy hating on them. But now I see why people switch. Having a boring Iphone that just works is better than having a Galaxy that struggles to really be what the spec sheet says it's supposed to be. The cherry on top of all of this was the S22Ultra was an absolute nightmare to sell. It took me minutes to sell the 12 pro max and first 13 pro max for great pricing,  the S22 Ultra resale on the other hand was just horrible. Stores only want to offer $500- $600cad for trade in, people dont want to buy it for more than $800cad but every store you look at is selling it brand new for $1600+cad"	R

Does anyone else feel the antennas on this phone are horrible?	"Some backstory; me and wifey had Note 10+ previously, and never had any any issues getting a good connection anywhere.
We both got S22 Ultras a few months back, the 1TB unlocked version, hooked up to Verizon. 
Now, I don't know if it's Verizon (since they started upgrading all their towers to 5G) or these phones, but we get signal drops all the time, in many places we've never had issues. Usually never an issue in cities, but regular suburban roads we travel we completely lose connection to the towers (get the dreaded no data icon in the top bar). We also do a lot of camping, and in some remote campgrounds that we previously got at least 1 or 2 bars of 4G on our Note 10+, we get absolutely no service on our S22 Ultras.
To make matters worse, even the WiFi connectivity seems pretty poor. I use for example a Matterport 3D/360 camera connected to my phone via WiFi, and previously I'd have no problem getting a connection to the camera through walls to the other side of houses. But now if I'm not like within 10 ft of the camera and maximum of 1 wall between it and the phone it loses connection.
I thought maybe it's my phone case (I have one with metal in it on the back for magnetic phone mount) because my wife's S22 Ultra seems to get slightly better signals than mine (not much better) but even if I take the case completely off it usually doesn't improve things.
Other issues to mention, my phone constantly freezes and restarts itself multiple times a day since the last OTA update, even when I have only 1 app or even no apps open. I've submitted the crash reports to Samsung through the members app, and their response is always to uninstall and stop using the app that was running when the phone restarted according to the logs. So apparently they want me to uninstall and stop using mainstream apps like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit Mobile, etc. Lol. Unacceptable in my opinion.
I also have constant issues where the phone runs really slow and lags or is choppy. Usually when using any app that is a bit resource intensive, but not anything this phone shouldn't be able to handle! I monitor the RAM usage and what really suprises me is that even with no apps open and none running in the background, my ram usuage can get up to like 88% used. Does the Android system really use that much RAM? Holy crap.
I'm holding out some hope they fix these issues with the next update but I feel like at this point I'm going to be disappointed. This is probably the worst phone I've ever owned and that's really sad considering it's the flagship. Idk I thought maybe my phone is just defective but the fact my wife's phone has the same issues just leads me to believe I can't be alone."	R
Please Help! Did Samsung Ever Fix Whatever the Issue Was That Made Data Transfer Speed to PC Painfully Slow?	I'm still on the S10+ because of the removable SD card slot.

Group texts not coming through when connected to wifi	"I tried searching, but couldn't find anything on this topic. It only happens intermittently, but often enough that it's annoying. 
When my phone is connected to WiFi, texts from others to a group text thread that I'm included on don't come through. If I open the messages app, there's an orange bubble on the thread between me and that individual person. When I open that thread, there is an undelivered message that fails to download when I tap on it. After turning WiFi off and tapping to download the message again,  it comes through in a group thread. There are times I will have multiple undelivered messages in separate individual threads, and when I get them to download with WiFi off, they are all to the same group thread. It's not one single group this happens with though, it will happen with any group text.
Like I said, this is an intermittent but pretty frequent occurrence, and I'm not changing any other settings, even ones that shouldn't have anything to do with WiFi/data/SMS/MMS. Any thoughts or troubleshooting ideas?"	R
Samsung Music App won't play gapless	"Hello, 
I've been looking for an answer for this for ages, but having thought I'd sorted it out, the problem has arisen again. 
The issue is that my Samsung Music app won't play gapless.  There is a small, maybe .25 of a second gap between each track when playing an album, which might not sound a lot but it's noticeable especially when playing live albums or ones where tracks segue together.   
For ages I thought the Skip silence between tracks option should be turned On, but then I found by accident that turning it Off resolved the issue, and my albums played perfectly for a while.   
I then changed phones and also the app has been updated, and once again, the gap has returned, and seems to happen with the Skip silence option either on or off. 
The strange thing is, yesterday afternoon, I switched the Skip silence to Off and it worked fine for a while, but this morning, I'm getting gaps again, and changing the Skip Silence setting seems to make no difference.   
I know I can use another music player, but other than this issue, I like the Samsung one, and it's become a bit of an obsession to find a solution to this.   
Can anyone help?  Phone is Galaxy S22+, just upgrade from an S10+ 
Thanks, 
Simon."	R
Is there a way to improve camera performance?	Between the long times it is taking to start, and the slow lens switching or mode switching, or overall slow performance, is it possible to make it any better?

Gaming Performance...	"Hi all. I just upgraded my s10+ for the s22u (snapdragon) and the gaming performance is substantially worse - feels like its constantly lagging with occasional touch screen issues. 
I understand there were issues previously but they were apparently fixed earlier this year in an update? 
Has anyone else experienced these issues since then? Any pointers for me to go about improving performance? I've got game booster optimised &amp; done everything I can think of to this point. 
Thanks in advance.
Update: I accidently put my screen to sleep and reopened it by pressing the button quickly. As a result the Samsung Game Plugin wasn't activated and all of a sudden I was able to play properly. It has something to to with the game booster plus, even though I had it set to Max fps/performance it was severely harming the fps.
So problem solved and lesson learnt, don't trust boosters.
Edit: thanks for all the help everyone, problem solved and I am truly appreciative."	R

Charging brick issues	"Charging brick issues
Hi guys, ordered me a bunch of chargers to try out but having issues with the 45w charger. I got the Spigen one but I don't see 'Super Fast Charging 2.0' on the screen. Charger itself supports PPS 45W even saying it supports the S22 Ultra. Then I got the Aergiatech 65W one. I do need multiple ports so figured the watch and the phone can charge at fast speeds. Issue I'm running is both say they support the wired standard of PPS 45W and support the device but 'Super Fast Charging 2.0' does not show up. 'Super Fast Charging' shows up. Only the Samsung one shows the 2.0 one. I did link both chargers below for reference. I want to know a few things from the community, is the charger not doing it or the phone doesn't recognize the 2.0 but is in fact doing it at 45w like some sort of proprietary thing to Samsung. I do like to charge with multiple devices. 
Couple of other things I like to mention, I have a MacBook air, that does in fact take the charge from Aergiatech one and a couple of other devices using full speeds but not the S22 Ultra.
I did find out from other posts that the Spigen one doesn't support it. It's lying about that so any help would be greatly appreciated. 
The Samsung charger is the solution but I want alternatives with better warranty than the Samsung one. I had one and it burned by getting too hot. Got it from Verizon and they refused to do anything about it. Told me to call Samsung. Samsung said it was my fault and they can't do anything so moved on to a different brand after spending 50 bucks"	R
I almost love my S22ultra	"So I got the S22U back when it was released, trading in my venerable Note 9.  I loved the note, however it was showing its age.  I am a heavy S pen user so I had held out to see what would happen with the S22 line.
Overall I have been happy with the phone in most aspects except one.  That being kind of a big one since it gets used so often.  
That is the under screen fingerprint sensor.  Now I do use a screen protector (whitestone dome glass), and I have recalibrated the sensor multiple times.
It seems some days it works flawlessly.  And then other times, like when i need it most (like getting ready to pay at the checkout)  it just fails and fails and fails.
Any tips or tricks?  I'm happy to switch to a different screen protector if others have found ones that work better.  I would have a hard time going without any screen protector as I'm pretty hard on my phones."	R
SpeakerPhone or Video Calls sound cuts out with noise in background	"Title pretty much explains it. During video calls or phone calls that I place on speakerphone, if there is any noise in my background, their speaking cuts in and out. It's as if my mic is expecting me to speak and cuts off the sound.
I've tested this by muting any sounds in the background and it immediately resolves the issue. I don't have a blaring tv or loud music going, as that would be understandable. It's usually just a tv show or something at low volume in the background.
Any ideas on how to change sensitivity of the mic or some kind of setting that I'm missing?"	R

This is the most inconsistent Samsung device yet	"**Rant Post**  
I have never had a device that could have been worse than the P6P after launch. It's just consistently bad, with no signs of improvements for the past three security updates. I have a list of issues I could go into, like 5G never reconnecting once I go into Edge, or Wifi networks not even displaying. The display lag that is very prominent, latency when using bluetooth devices. The list could go on. But I have **never** had a Samsung device be this inconsistent. Literally, never. And I've been using Samsung since the S5."	R

-when connected to my house wifi, turn on some lights

S22 Ultra has morphed in the Note Series!.	"Has Samsung basically rebranded the S22 Ultra to a Note 22 ultra!?
Come on Samsung, I purchased the S series because i didn’t want a SPen, or a boxed design!. S21 ultra was leaps ahead in design imo.
Get the S22 plus then? No!.. because then I’m missing out on the highest specs.

Who is planning to trade in their S21 for a S22?	"Last year, Samsung put out amazing pre-order deals for the Galaxy S21 lineup and I was wondering if any veterans know if that was a rare occurrence or is this typical and will be expected for the S22 series launch as well? 
If I can get $700 trade in value for my current S21, I will probably trade up for an S22. My only gripe is that I believe my S21 is the perfect small phone size and I hate that rumors point to Samsung reducing the size of the S22. I believe what really needed a reduction in size was the S22+, being it was only 0.1"" smaller than the ultra. What do you guys think?"	N
So... who's getting an S22?	I know it's unlikely to make any difference in day-to-day usage, but if Samsung lets me upgrade for $200-250 with trading in my S21, I'll probably do it simply because the S21 is likely to lose about that much in value over the next year. Will probably reconsider if the SD 8G1 is actually worse than the 888.	N

debating on s21 ultra or s22/s22+	"im in the market for a new phone since my s9+ broke last year and ive since downgraded to an s7 edge. rumors say that the s22 lineup will come in feb, which would also mean the s21 line will definitely get discounted.
my question is, assuming both would be similarly priced and based on what we know on paper about the s22 lineup so far, should i go for an s22+ or an s21 ultra?
the reason i wont get an s22 ultra is because i dont really use the stylus even though i love the note's boxy design, and also the price, new ultras are just too expensive for me."	N
S22 Ultra and Snapdragon/Exynos?	"Hey guys,
I'm in for a new phone, haven't upgraded at all since my Huawei Mate 20X but it's starting to show signs of dying.
At first, I wanted to go for the Note 20 Ultra Snapdragon, but decided to wait for the S22 Ultra.
But after seeing some tests about the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, I was wondering if it'll be more problematic than the new Exynos? I heard they did something with AMD so could it have better performances?
I have mixed feeling about the 8 Gen 1, I don't know if the problem is the chipset or if it's the cooling system.
Anyways, I'm mostly a power user, I plan on using my phone to play heavy games like Genshin and use heavy emulators.
What do you guys think? With the little info we currently have, can the Exynos potentially be better than the Snapdragon? (I read a lot about how Exynos sucked on the Note 20)"	N

What  confuses me is S21 FE, which would be priced over S21 lineup, so I'm a  little hesitant. It would make S21 FE price over S21 and that would make  no sense. Will price drop or S21 will more likely go out of stock give  the chip crisis?
Right now, there  is and price drop on S21 Ultra making it cheaper than S21+, but I  really, really don't want curved screen anymore. I know Ultra is  probably better, but curved S10 is driving me crazy.

S10+ to S21+, or wait for S22+?	"Hello guys,
I know it's a frequent question, but I really want help with deciding based on my situation.
I own S10+ for about 1,5 years now, I like it, but there are some setbacks I have with it, first is, that my unit has kinda loose charging point, which makes it difficult to charge from powerbank with most of the cables. The charging works, so service won't do anything. Secon is, that it has curved screen, which, I couldn't get used to for the time with it and I really don't like (almost hate) the fact the lights make the sides shine, hiding some content (letters in my music player, etc.) and last is, I would like to use 5G as 4G service is terrible where I live, but we have brand new 5G lately.
Now, I got a good deal on S21+, which makes it 380 USD (converted) cheaper, than it's normal price. Still cost more, than when I bought S10+, but given the chip crisis and low stock, I'm affraid, that S21 won't make it to August sales I got S10+ in, leaving me with priced S22. 
Second thing is, that my family member's phone stopped working, so I would have use for my S10+, not wanting it to use for lowering S22 price. Also, I'm a bit affraid of S22 and it's AMD components.
So, here I am, wondering, if to grab one of the few S21+ left on the market, or wait for S22, possibly losing opportunity to buy S21 in the process.
Do you think, that sale, which S21 lineup will make after S22 arrives will be more, than 380 USD I have now and do you think S22 will be much better, than S21?
What I really like on S10+ is battery life and camera. How is S21+ compared with battery life and camera? Is hybrid zoom same quality as S10+? 
Thank you very much for help and sorry for this question again."	N

Why do people care so much about the S22 ultra getting rid of the micro SD slot?	"I'm not trying to be controversial here but I need to understand the reasoning behind the hate here. In todays day and age, online cloud storage is cheap, if not free, and very useful. What are we actually storing on our micro SD cards that we cannot store in the cloud? Plus are you guys really put here maxing out your phones storage to the point where you need a micro SD? I don't think I'm going to be in the market for the S22 ultra simply due to my current finances, but if I could afford it the lack of an SD card means nothing to me as I genuinely don't see the need for one in the first place? Please tell me what you guys need that functionality for?
Edit: thanks for the insight guys I genuinely appreciate it. As one commentor has said it really comes down to personal use. I genuinely haven't stored music or huge amounts of images/moves or any media on my phones for years, and just through sheer credulity I thought that most other people didn't either.

Non-scientific way to check if S22 will be Exynos or Snapdragon in your country (rumours only, for fun only)	"Pls don't flame me.. Its just for fun. It might not be true. 
1) Choose SoC:
SM-S908E (Snapdragon)
SM-S908B (Exynos) 
2) Choose country from CSC ( Google to find your country code) 
Example: Mexico-IUS, Thailand-THL, India-INS etc etc 
3) Check firmware development 
https://fota-cloud-dn.ospserver.net/firmware/THL/SM-S906E/version.test.xml
https://fota-cloud-dn.ospserver.net/firmware/THL/SM-S906B/version.test.xml
Samsung is actively developing Snapdragon firmware for Thailand and none for Exynos - hence my guess is Thailand will get Snapdragon.

Until recently (meaning it cant do VoLTE) and due to the 3G shut down in Feb22 the phone will basically be useless then. Question being, do i upgrade to the s21 FE now or wait a bit on the s22 to be dropped? Thanks for answering	N
Torn between S22+ or S22 Ultra. What are some things you guys use the pen for? Are there people that don't use it on their Note at all?	Honestly I generally always get the highest end model because I generally just hate knowing I'm lacking some features. The S-pen isn't exactly one of those features, but I am curious to see how it's made people's lives easier without realizing it.	N
Get s21 ultra or wait for s22 ultra (exynos)	Hello, I'm wanting to buy the s21 ultra right now but should I wait for the s22 ultra to come out? I can get an s21 ultra for around £700 right now but I also don't mind spending the extra to get the 'note like' design and extra performance	N

Should I upgrade to the S22+?	"This has been the best phone I've had. I have no issues with it except for the battery. While it's not bad, it doesn't last as long as I need it to. I use my phone for work as well and I am constantly taking pictures and videos, making voice and video calls, sending many messages, and uploading many different files in different platforms like Google Drive. The only thing I'm worried about is storage. The main reason I didn't upgrade my S10 to the S21 was because of the lack of an SD card slot. Clearly, that one isn't making a come back. If there is a 512GB option for the S22+, which I don't think there will be, that would be my go to. I don't like what they've done with the Ultra which is basically the Note. I like the rounded-corner look of the regular S22s. Should I upgrade to the S22+? If the renders are accurate, that white one looks amazing

Preorder bonus for S22 series	"Hey, I’m thinking about buying the S22 Ultra which is releasing soon-ish. 
Never had a Samsung smartphone, but have the Tab S7 as a productivity device and that is making me switch back to Android. 
I’ve read around here that Samsung’s preorder bonus are usually pretty generous, so I was wondering what you got in the past by preordering and also any speculation for what we can expect for Samsung to deliver. It’ll also be appreciated if you specify the location since Europe usually gets the worst deals.

Hard time deciding between Pixel 6 and s22 (base).	"I recently picked up a Pixel 6 after coming from a Note 8. I like some of the stock android features like call screening, now playing, and the haptics are a million times better than my old note. However I was kind of looking forward to having a smaller phone this time around, which the pixel 6 is not.
I do really enjoy the stock android software but I do miss some Samsung features. Especially Samsung pass, which allows me to quickly log into some of my work related apps (Microsoft teams regularly logs me out and requires me to sign back in) whereas Google's smart lock doesn't seem to work for everything like Samsung pass did.  
The build quality of the pixel, while having the illusion of being quality, still feels cheap compared to my note 8. The screen is hollow feeling whereas my note 8 feels solid. I dunno. Just having a hard time deciding on keeping the Pixel 6 or sending it back and getting the smaller s22. 
Thoughts appreciated."	N

Will the S22+ camera be better than the S21 Ultra's?	"I don't care about processor speed, I only care about camera. The S22 Ultra will be too expensive meanwhile the S21 Ultra is at 950€ right now. The S22+ will be around that price.
What camera is going to be better? S21U or the S22+?"	N
S22 update no one is talking about... Aspect ratio.	"For those who haven't seen, the S22 and S22+ are changing to the same aspect ratio as the iPhone. If you've had a Samsung in the past you may have notice in certain apps (especially social media apps, like Instagram reels for example) that stuff can get cut off or placed weird. Changing to the same aspect ratio as the iPhone will be huge in resolving this issue and hopefully provide better app consistency/quality on Android.
So this isn't anything major but a nice quality of life improvement.
Also, I haven't been seeing people reporting about this in videos or articles lately so just thought it'd be good to bring up for those considering a new phone."	N

Am i the only one who Hates the fact S22 Ultra become a Note phone basically ? :/	"I don't mind if there were Options for a true S22 Ultra design and S22 Note ultra

Weighing Options For S22	"Hello guys I am undecided on my strategy when it comes to paying for the S22 Ultra or even if I should upgrade. 
So background; I leased a Note 20 Ultra 5G last year, which I promptly payed off a few months after. All through Samsung Financing. 
My Note 22 works great, and I have no complaints about it. I've always been a fan of the Note series since it was introduced, and it's kinda cool knowing this is the last official Note line series phone.
My conundrum is if I should trade it in for an estimated $750-800, or finance it through Samsung and hold onto my N20U.
My only beef with the supposed leak of the S22U is that it no longer has an SD card slot, I do use my SD card, but I can make the sacrifice I think.
What do yall think?"	N

I absolutely need to get a new phone regardless since I've dropped mine a couple of times and the screen is not perfect at the moment. No cracks but some damage regardless. I'm considering just buying a new S20+ or S20 Ultra outright.

I feel like there aren't that many large changes aside from the built-in S Pen and Snapdragon Gen 1 chip.

Wait for s22 or take trade in promo now?	"Hi I was looking for some advice. I finished paying my installment on my phone recently and saw they were offering an (¿Up to?) $800 trade in value. Seems a little too too good to be true considering the market value of my phone (S10+). 
I haven't been following prices or promos for the last couple of years and I was hoping someone had.
Also, I was assured I would get the full $800 trade in value by customer support and in the store but the ""up to"" gives doubts 🧐. 
My questions are: 
1. Is the $800 trade in promo normal or something rare that I need to take advantage of while or lasts? Or will there likely be something similar on the s22 range when they come out?
2. Has anyone had experience with a trade in promo and did you get the full value?

It's been a year with S21 Ultra, and S22 Ultra is just around the corner	"I've had my Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra for a year and have used it extensively, so these are my observations. 
Clearly, there are many pros than cons with this device.
Pros: 
Design: This phone has a lovely design that will last for many years. If you look back in 5 years, I'm confident you'll find this phone lovely. It feels heavy and chilly to the touch, but it does not appear weighty to others until they take it in their hands. The black variant is elegant. Other colors, on the other hand, look fantastic. It is worthy of the high price you are paying. going to talk about 120 hertz because it's included in almost every phone these days. Unless you're looking for it, I still think it's not that obvious.  
The performance of the Exynos processor-equipped Indian model is great. It hasn't caused me any problems until now. It has lots of RAM, so multitasking is as simple as you'd like. 
It has everything in terms of hardware, including Wi-Fi 6e compatibility, the latest Bluetooth, fantastic speakers that are loud enough, a large fingerprint unlock, wireless charging, and water resistance. I used it throughout the rainy season, and it worked perfectly after wiping away the wet. 
One UI is sleek and uncomplicated. It's quite practical for me. It's no surprise that some of the functions have been integrated into Google's stock operating system. 
If you like to capture moments whether you're outside, at home, on the terrace, or at a restaurant late at night, you'll need a camera. Your photographs will be stunning. All modes are available, including pro mode, and Samsung recently added Expert Raw capability to the device, which is a game-changer. 
I was looking forward to seeing the images from the new iPhone. My cousin, who purchased an iPhone 13 Pro Max, preferred the images taken with the S22 Ultra. Yes, for videos, it’s iPhone. 
Cons: No SD card slot, no headphone port, and it's a little slick. 
Additional information: If you want mind-blowing music and superb call quality, grab a set of Galaxy Buds Pro. Definitely superior to my Airpods Pro."	N
Looks like the base S22 is gonna be the stepchild again	After reading the latest "leaks" (yeah, right). It looks like the base S22 will get the short end of the stick just like the base S21 did. Charging speed limited to 25w, while the plus and ultra will support 45w. Probably no UWB (ultra wide band) again. I truly don't understand why Samsung doesn't acknowledge that buyers want small flagship phones with the exact same features as the larger siblings, for many reasons. The company may as well drop the FE line and be honest that the base Ss ARE the FEs. BTW, there recently was a poll done showing that the plus will be the least desirable S22 model - Ultra came first, then base.	N
I'll be upgrading to the S22 Ultra and also the newest version of the galaxy buds. As for the watch, I only use it to actually tell the time so no need for an upgrade. I'm very excited for the S22 ultra since my previous phone was the Note 10+ and I adored it		N
Wait for S22 Release? What promos will become available? Pixel 6 instead?	"Hello,
I am looking to upgrade my LG G7 ThinQ. Sad that LG no longer makes phones, but I'm lucky to get my G7 to even slow charge nowadays.
From all my research so far, it looks like Samsung's flagship phones or the Pixel series will likely fit with what I want. I'd like to continue my service with Verizon. In store, one of the customer reps told me to wait until the S22 comes out because there may be some nice promo deals. I don't know if he was talking about the new line of phones or they will give good promos for the S21 line? Does anyone have history with waiting for a new phone release?
I'm considering just getting the Pixel 6 (knowing all the QC issues) because I'll be able to get it sooner and won't have to be anxious about my G7 phone dying and/or not charging. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks"	N
Wait for s22	"I have an s10. The current time trade in value for an s21 says $150. If I wait for the s22 you think there will be better offers on release? 
Does anyone remember previous T-Mobile offers on new Samsungs?"	N
I got to see the S22 Ultra in hand	"I work for Verizon in sales.
The phone looks exactly like the Note 20 Ultra pen built in and body size but the camera doesn’t stick out it’s almost all flat.
Ask me anything I’ll try to answer with the little info I was given."	N
Reservations of S22	For those that signed up for the S22 reservation to be notified via email when the pre-orders go live, is that just actually to get on the email notification list only? Or does it also reserve you a a device so as long as you pre-order it the day it goes on sale or within a certain time frame?	N

S22 Ultra, Z Fold or keep Note 20 Ultra?	"* Still well within the return window for the Note 20, just got it last week. Still have my Note 9 to fall back on and wait for an S22 Ultra if I want. 
* Fingerprint scan issues have proven pretty annoying, though I've gotten a little more used to pressing harder. The success rate has improved since I did the usual so-called fixes/tips but it's still around 1 in 3 failure rate. My Note 9 was nearly 100% and much quicker to scan. The facial recognition is rudimentary at best compared to Apple's lidar. 
* Slightly concerned about it being 1.5-ish years old and the dreaded 'you only got x more updates coming' bit. 
* I settled for 128GB (my Note 9 was 512gb) but the memory card slot makes up for that (mostly). I'd prefer 512GB \*and\* memory card slot but as we all know, Samsung is adding that to the growing pile of removed features/options. 
* Also considering a Z Fold 3 -- I used to have PocketPC and WindowsCE slider and clamshell phones/pdas 'back in the day' so could be nostalgic. \*shrug\*
* Other than fingerprint scanning, the Note has been pretty solid aside from a couple of complaints (like 120hz limited to FHD). Put a glass UV glue screen protector on there and managed to do it perfectly, including the little weight on the fingerprint area. No bubbles or spillover/drips at all. I'd prefer not going through that again w/ a S22 Ultra (lol)."	N
S22 pre order UK gifts- 45w power brick and smart tag?	EE have suggested pre order gift will be charger and smart tag worth £74.99. Which suggests 45w power brick and a smart tag	N
Another S22 mystery	I just read today on Androidauthority.com that the A53 will be the same size as the A52 5G, but the battery will be increased from 45000mah to 5000 mah. So, why can't Samsung increase, rather than decrease, the battery on base (or should I write "basic") S22 or at least keep it at 4000mah as on the base/basic S21? Clearly, Samsung has demonstrated that it should be technically possible. Believe it or not, I am not a Samsung hater. I am progressively more disappointed Samsung fan.	N

Trading in my Fold 3 for S22 Ultra.	"Main reasons - 
App aspect ratios
Lack of good camera Zoom lens (fold 3 lens is basically what I had on my Note8\9)
Lack of S Pen Housing in phone (i love having a bkuetooth S Pen especially for camera)
Narrow screen on the front ( it was good at first but now its annoying)
This is the longest message I have typed in 6 months due to the the narrow screen keyboard being too marrow and the inner screen keyboard being too wide. Missing a nprmal phone experience badly!
Ps - i. Leaving my typos as is to display how much difficulty I am having in typing long messages. Lol"	N
When do Pre-orders start exactly for the S22U?	This is my first time doing a Reservation a bit ago with Samsung and pre-ordering from them with my tradein. But I want to make sure I know when it starts. Is it during the Unpacked Event? Before? After?	N
How much better do people think the s22 camera will be compared to the S21?	"I am in the market for a new phone. A good phone camera is really all that I am interested in.

Do people think that the increase in camera performance will justify the increased cost?
p.s. I would consider a pixel 6 if it were available in my country, however it is not."	N
S22 Ultra Back Cover	Hi! I'm currently planning to buy an S22 Ultra in phantom white and is curious if the finish on the back cover is similar with the rest of the colors (burgundy, black, green)?

S22 ultra?	With the s22 line dropping in a few days I think I've decided on getting the s22 ultra. My major concern is the size. I've never used a note so I'm a big worried that the phone might be too big. For context, I'm currently using an S9. For note and ultra users, is the difference in size that noticeable and how useful is the s pen?	N
Onenote on Samsung s22 ultra (and other note phones)	Is onenote optimized for the s pen? I know samsung notes syncs with onenote which is cool and all, but for university, I've been using a very sophisticated onenote folder&gt;section&gt;page structure. And I would like to continue using that on the s22 ultra when I get it. So I was wondering if onenote was optimized for the s pen. As in it doesnt just take s pen input as regular finger input, rather more precise input with the pressure sensing stuff etc.	N

"I'm planning to buy S22+ or ultra and I was going through Twitter where some opine that SD has 'heating issues' and Exynos is better which wasn't the case in the previous version it seems. Apparently they did some tests and found out SD has heating issues and the previous Exynos had the same.
Someone please tell me what this is all about and guide me."	N
One thing that no one has mentioned regarding S22 Ultra (From old Samsung user)	"Don't get me wrong, the S22 Ultra seems to be a great phone coming out in a few days with the below and more
&amp;#x200B;
\- Great battery with fast charging
\- High refresh screen at highest resolution
\- Splendid tray of cameras for every situation
&amp;#x200B;
A spectacular phone which I don't believe will let people down but there is one aspect that no one has been mentioning.
The stylus (Spen) is on the left side of the phone instead of the right side (Note 7, Note 8, Note 9 I believe all has their s pen slot on the right side of the phone) I am not sure about the Note 10+ or Note 20 Ultra
Can anyone explain why Samsung would have s pen slot on the left side of the phone when most of the population is right handed?"	N

Galaxy s21 at 519€ or s22 at ???	Hi guys, im actually using pixel 6 i want to go back to "compact" phone, like my previous s10e. I was sure about s22 for compact size, but now s21 is at 519€ directly from samsung. What should i do? I should wait s22 or going to s21? is SOT around 5-6 hours now on s21? Thank you	N
Guess the trade-in value for a S21U towards S22U?	"As are alot of you, I can't wait for the Note like return of the S22U and I will be using Samsung when I pre-order and trading in my S21U for it.
I'm wondering how much they'll give us towards the S22U. I'm guessing with the chip supply issue going on that they will be pretty generous with trade-in values with the S21U for parts. So I'm gonna guess anywhere from $700-800."	N

Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra first look: S Pen, best zoom lens, new features		N
Advice of S22 Ultra storage size to order	My current phone is the Note 8. It's only a 64 GB phone, but I do have a microSD card in it for additional storage. However you can't move apps and things like to the microSD card. As it is, the internal storage is almost always perpetually full. Right now it is showing me 58 out of the 64GB is full. Considering the S22 won't have a slot for a microSB card to expand any storage and the fact that it is essentially a 4K phone with much higher res photos, videos and everything else thus each bit of media is larger. What is the smart route to go? 128 GB, 256 GB or even 512?	N
S22 longevity?	Would you expect to get as long a life from the above, as you would a new IPhone?	N
When does the S22 go on sale?	"Based on previous events, does the new phone go on sale at the start of the event, at the end of it, or midway as it’s announced?
I’ve found various comments in different threads saying different things, I just need to know when I can step away from work to place my order.
Also is that considered a pre-order since it really goes on sale a couple of weeks later?"	N
so, who's jumping ship to the S22 Ultra?	Personally, I'm not. If you have an S21 ultra, it looks like it's almost the same device... I'm a bit underwhelmed.	N
I waited to see what the s22 ultra would be, I brought the Z fold 3 instead.	"So, to give a quick brief history. I haven't posted in this forum in a couple years so hello all, glad to be back. From the Galaxy s5 to Note 9 I basically would upgrade back in forth from the S line to Note line with every new version. I realized with the note 9 it was darn near a perfect phone and I didn't need to be upgrading phones every 6-12 months anymore IMO. I held on to it for 2yrs and then got the S20 Ultra, not on launch day, I waited 2 months and got a great deal on it after the camera controversy. I've used and loved the s20 ultra ever since and the phone is great in almost every area. The note 20, s21s didn't add enough to the table to make me upgrade. The s22 ultra seems almost good enough to upgrade for me but it doesn't provide that ""It"" factor to really justify for me to say it's worth it's price for the upgrade. It's basically a more refined version of what I already have IMO.  
So I've always wanted a fold line device since they were introduced a couple years ago, it's appeal is immense! but I did not like the price! I was also warned about the camera quality drop off, from the s ultra line. However the device seems to provide everything I could want, size when opened and closed, including s pen option and unique capabilities. With the s22 launch, came carrier discounts! and Tmobile has a deal to get the s22 ultra as an upgrade with trade for $1000 off! This offer is extended to the Fold 3 as well! So I went with the Fold! I don't need the newest device anymore and the fold 3 seems to have more to offer and a different experience than what the s22 ultra would provide IMO. Also, since Samsung has promised software updates for 4yrs on both devices, we're all winning no matter which device is chosen. Just thought I'd share my process of determining my next device which I plan to keep for at least 2yrs. Everyone enjoy your tech!"	N
Best phone tripod for s21 ultra/s22 ultra	Hello to all, i recently pre-ordered the s22 ultra and I am looking forward to tech it's camera capabilities.

Will the S22 Ultra camera and S-pen features come to the S21 Ultra with software update?	"Do y'all think that the new camera and s-pen features of the S22 Ultra will come to the S21 Ultra over a software update?
Features like the AI detecting where the pen will move next or the camera being able to separate individual stands of hair on a subject and blur out the background sound amazing.
Did samsung talk about dropping these features with a software update in the previous versions? Is it even possible?
The camera one should be possible but I wonder if the s pen features combine better hardware as well or not."	N
S22 Disappointment	Anyone else extremely disappointed by S22 Ultra? It’s basically same phone as S21, except they added a pen. Where are the new features? Innovations? I mean even Apple adds more to a phone every year… as a fan of Samsung this was disappointing	N
S22 Ultra Camera Features	Guys i just watched s22 ultra camera review in YouTube Samsung has added some crazy new software features like super detailed 108mp shots and improved 30x shots.

I was waiting for the S22 to upgrade from an S9, but I got the S21 today instead!	"I wanted to upgrade my daily driver because because the battery life is getting worse everyday, and decided to wait for the S22!
But after watching Samsung unpacked and the hands-on videos I went for the S21 for these reasons:
- Bigger battery 
- it also got 4 years of software upgrades 
- price : 650€ for 256GB
- in my opinion better overall design 
The S21 as it is now is a better deal than the S22, new 50 MP camera sensor apart, there is no new distinct feature that differentiate the phone."	N

N20U&gt;S22U	"I'm tired of making this list comparing to S22U, so here we go:
.
No SD card slot
No MST for magnetic payments
S22U is heavier and thicker
High price for NEEDED incremental internal storage
Smaller screen
Only 8G of memory - 12G went into some prior lines (N20U) with the advent of 5G. Most carriers are throttling connection speeds ALOT lately so slower speeds and less ram may be less of a concern. 10.6G currently used on mine and only opened a few things after a reboot. Edit...only base 22u has 8G, else 12G
Early pictures show over sharpening (sans pixel 6 style).
.
Now there's a few things that flip the other way. and i may have missed a few things.
I'll bet the S22U is a damn fine phone, but people usually just say all the difference is (insert only 1 thing).  One neat thing is that it shows a $600 credit for my N20U and a use it now $250 credit for acc or other things.  Not a bad deal.  I'd probably have to get the 1tb version since no SD card slot.
With all that said,  I'll probably just buy a S22U since I love tech.  I really don't want to part with my N20U.  Can't wait to see the real world S22U reviews later!  Just trying to put things into perspective here.  Positives for S22U...

Supposedly better cameras with better night abilities.
Faster wired charging.
Longer support/updates
Great trade in and use it now credit on current pre orders
Latest processor
Faster Spen response time"	N

I can get my hand on an S22 Exynos (base model) for about 250€ total.
I'm not sure because my main issue right now is the battery and the heat, I'm looking for a better battery and less heat and I don't want to spend 250€ to get 8gb of ram instead of 12, no sd card slot and 1080p screen, just to find out that Exynos battery is still bad
Thanks in advance"	N
Upgrade S20 to S22+ or S22 Ultra?	Just got an upgrade/trade in email from Sprint/T-Mobile. Seems like I can trade in my S20 128GB for S22+ 256 GB $0.00 per month for 24 months or S22 Ultra 256 GB $8.33 per month for 24 months even though I just have a S20 not S20+? System mistake?

£460 trade in on S20+ for S22 Ultra? You son of a bitch, I'm in!	"Was on the fence, but the trade in value for a 2yr old phone seems really good to me - £460 for a 128GB S20+ 5G. This brought down the S22 Ultra to a somewhat palatable price + they seem to be throwing in 1 year of Disney+ and Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro to boot. Pretty decent value overall I'd say, and you can even choose how much you want to pay now and then how long (12-36 months) you want to spread the remainder over, 0% APR. Nice!

I finally got my order to place with both S22 Ultra and Tab S8+ and all combined discounts and trade-ins (US Market)	"So after the disaster of yesterday I was finally able to order my S22 Ultra late last night. I had hoped to be able to order both that and the Tab S8+ in the same order to combine discounts but it kept rejecting it. I think the issue was there were too many discounts so I had accepted I would just have to wait to get my $250 eCredit and use that later to get it.
Anyway I woke up this morning to try again but this time it worked but I had to select the 256GB model as apparently with the 128GB model the discounts apparently would have made it less than $0 and the system rejected it. It also for some reason only worked with the original order still in place as I think there must have been an extra coupon that was also making the order have too large of a discount.
I hope this helps others who are struggling to try and get both items to stack with enhanced trade in as well as the $250 accessory credit and 25% off phone/tablet bundle discount.
With all of this and my education discount I got my Tab S8+ 256GB for $24.70. I could have actually gotten the 128GB Tab S8 Ultra for only $90 more but I have concerns it will be too bulky as well as battery life concerns with the much larger display but barely larger battery."	N

It looks almost just like the note I already have that's still in perfectly good shape except for a bit of that screen gluing issue (I'm in talks to have that covered under my insurance through my carrier rn) and I couldn't be happier this phone is worlds better so far for me.

S22 Ultra	Is anyone else considering the s22 ultra and trading in the fold? I'm currently using the fold 3 and I love the phone don't get me wrong. I'm just super nervous about breaking it. Not about me dropping it or anything. Like weather conditions or just opening it and it's broken. That kind of thing. I don't drop my phones. And I used my phone naked for like 3 months even and I was fine with doing that. I'm just nervous about the inside screen just breaking on me.	N
Any downside to getting a factory unlocked S22 versus VZW-branded?	"Looking at upgrading to the S22+ and thinking about getting the factory unlocked version from the Samsung website. Any downsides?
What do software updates look like if unlocked versus VZW? More timely or do they come later?
Is activating as simple as just telling them I'd like to BYOD and providing whatever relevant device info?
I saw previous comments about VZW not liking factory unlocked phones on their network, but that seems more conspiracy theory than fact.

S22 ultra 1000 off question	"I can get the s22 ultra 512gb (1299) and it says it will give be 1000 for my phone. I don't understand the credits though I suppose. It says I will pay 25 a month get a 300 credit and get the remaining 700 in credits monthly. Taxes are 73 roughly. So I don't understand the numbers because if I'm paying 25 a month that's 600? They are giving 1000 off though,  so that's 1600? 
I am positive I'm just missing something so if anyone can explain please let me know.  Also would you buy from t-mobile or samsung directly, seems I only pay just 690 total with them and own it outright?"	N

Minor rant: For those saying the S22 has little improvement over the S21 and isn't worth the upgrade, the S22 isn't for you.	"Despite what many here thinks, the S22 isn't really marketed for those who already own the S21 series phones. It's marketed towards those who own older Samsung phones like the S20 or S10, and those who are upgrading from last year's midrange to this year's flagship. Also, the majority of people upgrade their phones every 2-3 years, not yearly.
The smartphone market has matured and kindda stagnated since 2018 or so. The S10, S20, S21 were all minor upgrades over its predecessors. The S10 had the same main camera as the S9. The S21 had the exact same triple-camera sensors as the S20. The S22U has the exact quad-camera sensors as the S21U. In some case, even a slight downgrade (removal of certain features). This isn't unique to Samsung. Its happening across the entire industry.
I really don't get the ""S22 is a disappointing upgrade"" or ""should i upgrade my S21U to S22U"" posts.  If you're still with the S21 series, its best to just stick with it.  It's still powerful enough for a couple of years to come. If you're coming from an older S series, or A series phone, then go ahead. Its gonna be worth it."	N

Didn't see a clear case on the Samsung website and it would be a pity to cover up the lovely red. Hopefully there'll be some decent third party ones out soon. 
Estimated delivery is a couple of weeks longer than the standard colours. 
*I hesitate to call it truly free when Samsung are the ones setting the prices. They could have just set the original prices lower, but oh well.
UPDATE: I tried to post a new thread but it got removed. It looks like the glitch on the Samsung site, with the disappearing trade-in, has been fixed (10.37 PST)"	N
S22 Ultra: Any Plans for a Screen Protector? If so, any recommendations?	"Like the title says, anyone planning on getting a screen protector w/ their S22 Ultra, or just going to leave it to fate/viewcover-case?
I bought the LED viewcover case to help with scratches, but definitely still getting a tempered-glass screen protector. While it still feels too soon, I rather use the phone right away without fear of any damages.
Only question is which screen protector to get. I was considering [amFilm's 3D Tempered Glass](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09Q8RBZBS/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_i_BZ9Z6EC62MQXRH308VS8), always had great experience with amFilm brand protectors, but not sure how I feel about UV ones (seems like a hassle to remove/pull-off first try)."

S22/+/Ultra pre-order credit can be used on other accessories.	If you do not like what they offer as in things you can use your $200/$250 credit for, you can add other accessories. For example I added S Pen Pro first, then I went and made my selections with S22 Ultra Pre-order, it gave me $250 credit, I selected folio case and Galaxy buds pro, it said I had balance remaining and if I don’t use then I will lose it, I selected checkout, that remaining credit balance applied to S Pen Pro. Hopefully this helps :)	N
S22+ or S22U	Coming from an s9+, not quite sure which one to get. The difference i have to pay for the ultra is $50 (due to the trade in value being higher for the ultra) Are the curves exactly like the s9+ in the ultra as I prefer a flat screen (screen protectors are harder to put on a curved screen). Does the size also eclipse the 22+ as I don't want a chunky phone. Is the 50 extra worth it.	N

S22 vs. S9+?	"I have the S9+ for 4 years now. I've wanted a smaller phone for a while and the SAW appears to be slightly smaller (not pixel 4 size like I wanted, but still smaller). 
The s22 is lacking the ultra bright screen and fast charging of the S22 Plus. Do you think this is a good upgrade? I can get the SAW for free through ATT trade-in."	N
Good screen protector for s22 ultra?	Anyone know of a good glass screen protector that DOES NOT require glue. I don't want a Whitestone dome or any of those type. I just want one that is simple and sits right on the screen and takes 2 minutes to install. I don't care if the under display fingerprint sensor works or not. Thanks.	N
Finally got my S22U ordered, and the receipt didn't show the color choice!?	"I experienced the same delays as a lot of you last night, but finally got through after a couple of hours. Ordered a S22U with 1 TB, (unlocked, my first unlocked phone!), and when I got my receipt it didn't show the color choice!

Should I preorder the S22 Ultra? (Exynos)	"For me in the UK - the base model starts at £1149 - $1558!
And what am I paying $350 more for? Ah, the Exynos. Great.
I have a Snapdragon powered Tab S6, absolutely love the thing. OneUI is great, DeX is incredible, battery life is huge. 
Had a Exynos S21 for a week before returning it - it burned me hard with *tragic* idle battery drain. Ran the thing in flight mode to test - wasn't my sim or WiFi. Sucked because the phone itself was great - the screen, fingerprint scanner, haptics, build quality etc.
I want the S22 Ultra to replace both my Tab S6 and Pixel 5 - take it all into one device. It's gonna do everything a digital compact camera can do too. Is it worth the punt? Am I going to have my ass burned again, paying more for an awful chip, or do I wait for reviews? Somebody make it make sense to me."	N
Benefits of the S22 Ultra unlocked variant over carrier specific variants.	With T-Mobile: I want the S22 Ultra in red but it's unlocked. What exactly will I lose if I go unlocked vs the T-Mobile variant. Currently have a Note 20U and a S21 Ultra both T-Mobile variants. Trading in the S21.	N
Opinion: don't buy S22 Ultra if you have S21 Ultra	I held it today; its the same phone, with the same camera setup and quality, in a different design with an integrated S Pen. Do you need to waste $2,000 for the stylus, when you can buy a better S Pen Pro for $100? Those ,who don't have S21U, should buy S22U for sure.	N

Watching s22 ultra videos has me thinking about future Folds ...	"There was alot of talk about the note line disappearing in favor of the ultra series.  I wouldn't be surprised if we saw a full spec'd fold with a bump in camera, battery, and even housed an spen inside. It would be the ""Fold Note"" or something more clever.  
I would imagine they pair it with something similar to what we have now as the slimmer more ""compact"" folding device. At a lower price even?

Old Get More Plan - S22 Upgrade	"So on the website, I chose the Black S22 Ultra 256gb. Full price is $1,199. They are giving me $1,000 for my S21 Ultra trade in OVER 24 months. This is copied and pasted from the website  ""You'll get $1000.00 applied as $41.67 bill credit for 24 months, starting in 1-2 bill cycles.""
First, since I'm on the older get more plan, is that why it's 24 months and not 36?

S22 samsung att plan question	"I went to check out att locked s22 ultra from Samsung website. Noticed at checkout it says account owner name (am just an authorized user so my name doesn't show) and near it unlimited your way and my phone number.
Now our plan has att signature which is corporate discount and all parks that come with it. But all 5 lines show unlimited plan.
Now my question is am I the only one who is gonna be switched to unlimited your way or all 5 lines given we are all elite paying same amount. Also what am I losing if I alone become elite your way, do I lose in corporate discount? 
Any reason I should not go through this route if I want to get att phone to get both discounts samsung and att?"	N
Cant complete S22 order because phone number ineligible for transfer	"I'm currently on ATT prepaid and I'm trying to swap to postpaid for the trade in deal but they are showing my number is ineligible for transfer. I've read that ATT prepaid and NVMO carrier numbers do this since they are already on the network.
I just want to get the phone ordered without having to do any Google Voice/Numberbarn port shenanigans because I need my current phone to be usable until the S22 comes in the mail sometime early March I'd assume.
Can I just put my order in and say give me a new number and then once I get the phone then go to port my number? Or are they going to force me to use the phone with a new number at that point."	N
S22 Ultra Upgrade	"I need some help making an educated and practical decision. I have an s21 plus 128 g that I signed up for via the Next option in September 2021. In short, I do not like the phone and the camera is terrible. Is it best to purchase the s22 ultra unlocked or on AT&amp;T and do a sim swap from my s21 to the s22 ultra or trade in the device? I cannot find a clear answer online if it is possible to trade in a device on a payment plan to Samsung or Best Buy. The cost to payoff the device is 861 and to early upgrade via Next is 361.

Anyone having problem placing an S22 with samsung.com when the $50 tmobile activation discount is added?	"When evething in the cart and you click Checkout it goes to a page with a button that say Activate Device. Then if you click the Active Device button it goes back to the checkout page and you click checkout again it goes to the Active Device, back and forth, and you just cannot place the order....
Ps: I'm not sure if anyone come back to read this but I'm 100% convince the check out will only run you in circle if you try to stack too many discounts. 
Originally I have the phone , trade in, tmobile $50 discounts bundle for watch + earbuds that paid for by the $250 credit + ShopSamsung app discount. And could not check out for 2days. This morning the cart told me the watch was out of stock so I have to remove the watch+earbuds bundle and save the voucher for later. Then the tmobile activation just go, and I can checkout without any hiccup.
What's the catch??? Well you cannot buy the watch + the earbuds later for $250 lol.
Then I leave that order as is and creates another order WITHOUT the tmobile and the watch bundle was instock (???) , and everything check out super smoothly and now I don't have the tmobile discounts but I have the watch+earbuds so there's that."	N

Also, it would be nice to know exactly what I can access through that little window, or on the LED version what kind of things it will show and how much can I actually interact and/or customize it? My biggest concern is the magnet to keep it closed. I didn't get one of these for my previous note simply because I didn't trust that the flap wouldn't open on a hip high drop just from the air. And I see no point to have 360 degree protection if it can be overcome so easily. None of the listings for the say anything about it though.	N

Let's stop calling the Galaxy S22 a "compact"	"First of all I very much welcome Samsung reducing the physical size in this phone. But people are already calling it compact when, it's simply not. It's relatively compact when compared to other phones today, but I'm sorry it's just not compact.
A true compact is what the Sony Xperia compact range was. The Z5 and XZ1 compacts had a height of 129 mm. The S22's height is 146 mm. That's significantly taller. It's also 6 mm wider. Also remember the S10e? The S22 is still 4 mm taller than that.
There is only one true compact on the market today and that is iPhone 13 Mini with a height of 132 mm and width of 64 mm. It is just small enough to be a real ""compact"" and fit in any ordinary pocket. Everything else is too big to qualify as compact, and I'm just gutted that there are no equivalent Androids on the market from the big brands. I can only dream of a miniature flagship Galaxy."	N

Would I still have these issues with S22U?
I also do not have experience with the Note series, so any reason why I should get the S22U instead?
P.S. I also managed to scratch and crack my screen in less than a year of owning S8, so I am definitely not the most careful person lol."	N

Idk what Samsung is doing. I was excited to get the S22, but after seeing in person the camera that bad... Nah I'll skip

Considering switching from XS Max to S22 Ultra	"I’ve been using my phone for almost 3 years and its time is up. With a subscription plan I can get the 13 Pro Max for 600€, the Pro for 500€, the 13 for 200€, whereas the S22 Ultra is only 480€, and S22 Plus 360€. 
At this point I just feel like I’m definitely not getting my money’s worth with the iPhones except for maybe the 13 but then the upgrade won’t be that noticeable. The Pro Max is just too expensive and heavy for me and the S22 Ultra is really appealing to me. I have a windows PC and I’ve seen that Dex looks to be like a great feature. 
I have airpods and I’m worried about how they would work on Android. Furthermore, I use FaceTime and iMessage on the daily to text and call my long distance girlfriend and I’m afraid of missing it if I switch over. 
But once again, I feel like I get so much more with the Samsungs for much cheaper!!! What I really crave is the 120hz display but I feel like that compared to the Samsungs, the iPhones are extremely overpriced and overhyped.
Last but not least I’m worried about the longevity and battery life of the new Samsungs as I’ve heard bad things in the past. I’d ideally want it to last 3-4 years with 6-7+ hours of SOT."	N

Why should I consider upgrading to S22Ultra?	I have not seen any head to head comparison of the N20U to the S22U to know if I should even consider upgrading. I usually upgrade every 2 years, but the missing SD card is a real turn off to me and my N20U isn't really bothering me in any way. 10x optical zoom would be nice, but from the announcement, there really wasn't anything about the S22U that I *craved*. As an aside, I used to miss replaceable batteries. I don't miss those with the N20U, but today I was missing the RF blaster of old.	N
S20+ AT&amp;T $800 upgrade credit toward S22 Ultra... Am I reading this right?	I have an unlocked S20+ and preordered the Ultra 512 via Samsung for a little over $800 and then there is also the $250 credit. I just visited AT&amp;T and I can trade in the S20+ for an $800 credit which brings the payments to a little over half of what I would be paying through Samsung. If I added the NextUp plan I could also upgrade after 12-15 months. I am leaning toward canceling the preorder through Samsung and going with AT&amp;T for once, but I'm unsure if I'm missing something. I'm used to purchasing unlocked via Samsung, but with this deal and the fact I know I'll be with AT&amp;T for a while (discounted plan) I'm not sure which way I should go. In other words, is there a catch I'm missing with AT&amp;T?	N
Samsung s22+	Getting 800$ trade in value for the z flip 3 if I get the s22 😊, what do u guys think?	N
Hadn't planned on it, but $900 trade-in towards S22 Ultra...	I thought I'd hold the Fold3 at least until the 4 to see what they improved (cameras, integrated pen), but when I read they were giving $900 trade-in towards the S22 Ultra, I decided to buy. I only paid $913 for the Fold3 to begin with, so I got 5 months of use for $13 plus the cost of the case and pen. I enjoyed it, and may very well be back. Best of luck to you all!	N

AT&amp;T's s22 series pre-order gives you the opportunity to trade in any Galaxy phone, really, read the list, really old Galaxy phones and still get $800 off your new phone.   Have an old S3 still cluttering up a drawer somewhere? Maybe you haven't quite been able to let go of your Samsung Galaxy Note 2?   Or maybe you have one of those stupid S4 camera phones (zoom).  That too."	N
Is anyone else having issues purchasing an S22 through Samsung's website?	"As title says, it won't let me complete my purchase for an S22 Ultra on Samsungs website when selecting AT&amp;T as a carrier. Samsung rep said that carrier locked devices (with the $800 bill credit) have been having that issue, and suggested I buy an unlocked phone from them (in which would only give me $170 off for an S10 trade in). 
Am I misunderstanding this situation? Or did I just completely switch carriers today just to lose the color I wanted and pay double what everyone else is.
EDIT 1: The issue at hand is that when I ported my service over from a local carrier, the AT&amp;T rep moved my line as a ""bring your own device"" line. This set a temporary 90 day block on my account so that I can not upgrade. The S22 Ultra promo was considered an upgrade. 
EDIT 2: In case anyone finds this and has a similar issue, a very helpful manager was able to find a solution. 
Apparently, while there *is* a way around this, it seemed very convoluted and likely not SOP. HOWEVER, a very simple solution was just me paying a down payment on the financing. This worked well for me, since I have no problem paying a majority of the cost up front. I was still able to be eligible for the $800 bill credit, although I regrettably missed out on the $200 credit from buying through Samsung. Honestly just happy I could fix the issue and get $800 towards a new phone."	N
Another S22 trade in question (still on an installment plan)	"My son has an iPhone XS that we picked up a little over a year ago during the $29/mo bill credit promotion. We still have 16 months of payments left on that phone, but he’s currently using my wife’s old S7 active and not using the XS because of the poor parental controls on the IPhone. 
Is there a way to trade in the S7 for the Samsung promotion, and just turn in the XS and end the bill credits tied to that device so we’d be eligible for the bill credits for the Samsung promotion?"	N
Samsung s22 ultra	"So I ordered the s22 ultra switching from note 9 so definitely big jump for me can't wait so far shipping tells me 24th is it possible to get it sooner or will TMobile only release on the date of release

Any of you preorder the S22 Ultra from Samsung.com?	Samsung's website is showing the $800 off preorder deal from T-Mobile, and the accessory credit. Why shouldn't I order through Samsung? This is if you pick the T-Mobile variant in checkout.	N
Just received UPS notifications for S22 shipments	"Just got 2 email notifications from UPS that I have packages coming tomorrow from T-mobile.  Can it really be for my S22+ and S22 Ultra pre-orders?  I didn't expect them until next week at the earliest.  
Or is it more likely the return boxes for our trade ins?"	N
Just preordered the unlocked S22 Ultra	I'm wondering if I can add a phone (bought from Samsung) to the protection&lt;360&gt; plan or must the phone be bought through tmobile themselves? If you can give me some suggestions on what to do I would greatly appreciate it!	N
Samsung S22 Unlocked vs.T Mobile phone version	I'm going to purchase an Samsung S22 series phone direct from Samsung. I'm trying to decide between the unlocked or T Mobile phone versions. Can someone please explain to me what advantage, if any, to getting the T Mobile version. Also, if I choose the T Mobile version what is the process to get the phone unlocked.	N
Just pre-ordered the 512GB S22 Ultra T-mobile variant from Samsung, but I have a question.	"Hi guys,
I just pre-ordered the S22 Ultra (T-mobile variant) from Samsung.com for $448.29 tax included and I also get the $250 voucher to use on samsung.com after my phone ships. I am very excited to get this phone at such a great price.
I only did a single trade in (Note 20 Ultra) and was able to get $800 for it, and I also got an additional $50 off for activating the phone through checkout.
I had originally pre-ordered the unlocked variant because it was available in the exclusice red color. It's a very interesting color and I wish that there were videos on this color so I can see how it looks like in real life instead of just renders. I was able to get this one for $692.81 (after trade in) and I thought this was a great price, especially since the red color ended up selling out.
But then I found out that if I select T-mobile I get an additional $200 on my trade-in for the Note 20 Ultra and $50 off during checkout if I activate the phone during checkout. I wish the red was available to all carriers, but since it isn't, it's not worth the extra $244.52 for me. 
I will end up canceling the order for the unlocked red one, but before I do, I want to make sure that I will be able to unlock the phone day one. The reason being is because I travel a lot to Costa Rica for work and I want the ability to use my local Costa Rican SIM during my travels. I was able to unlock my Note 20 Ultra (after some hassle) and was then able to convert my T-mobile sim into an esim, which saved the slot for the physical sim so I could use it for my Costa Rican sim. Running dual sim (esim + nano sim) like this has been awesome on my Note 20 Ultra and I want to know if I would be able to do the same thing on my S22 Ultra. 
Will I be able to unlock the phone immediately or do I need to wait a certain amount of time before I'm eligible to unlock the phone? The phone will be fully paid off upon arrival.
Thanks for reading!

Getting a charger for S22 Ultra.	I pre ordered my S22 ultra, but couldn't use the credit for the 45W charger as it was out of stock, so I thought of buying from elsewhere. My friend suggested getting a GAN charger as it is good and all. I was worried if it will affect my phone in any way compared to the original charger. Also, if it is good, does anyone have any suggestions on which charger I should get?	N
Note20 Ultra To S22 a downgrade?	Am I just throwing money away moving from a Note20 Ultra to a vanilla S22 256GB? The Note has become cumbersome in my pocket and whilst I initially used the S-Pen all the time, it is now sitting unused. The things I'll most likely benefit from are the flat screen and the (hopefully) upgraded camera as this gets used all the time on my current device. Or do I save money and buy an S21/ S21FE?	N
S22 ultra triangle warning during charging assuming that's moisture	I just tried charging my s22 ultra and it gives a triangle warning my hands were washed a little before I unboxed but I find it unlikely it's so much the port hit moisture blowing in it didn't make a difference	N
Not sure I should keep my preorder (S22 ultra 1 tb)	" 
Hey everyone,
My  S10+ broke a few months ago so I've been on an iPhone 7 (work backup  phone) ever since pretty desperate to get back on android/samsung haha.   With that, I recently got the 1 tb s22 ultra graphite edition pretty  much fully out of pocket a few days ago from samsung directly. I also  picked the galaxy buds pro, and 65w trio charger and clear stand case as  accessories with the preorder bonus, bringing the total to $1727.99
I'm  having second thoughts on the preorder, thinking the 512 is a much  better deal since the upgrade in price only gets you storage space, not  ram or anything better (from what I understand).
That  being the case, I was going to try to preorder another 512 but all of  the good accesorries I would really be interested are sold out, and best  buy is in 'Coming Soon', so I'm not able to directly replace the  preorder with one equally as good.
Considering that and my situation, thoughts on how to proceed from here?
Thanks in advanced!"	N

S21 Ultra vs S22 Ultra camera differences.	"Looking at some of the photo comparisons, why are there differences when looking at the camera specs are almost the same? Is it hardware or the software? If software, does the older versions not get the update?
Was super excited with the release of the S22 Ultra that comes with the S-Pen. Was looking to buy a Note for about 2.5 years but refrained since every release of Notes will always have an inferior specs compared to the Galaxy series. However, the S22 Ultra is a bit too pricy where I am (around MYR 5k)."	N
Currently have S10 and pre-ordered S22. Does anyone know if Samsung fixed the very close up front camera especially on like snapchat? I know phone isn't out yet but was it fixed on S21?	Essentially what I said above. The front camera was extra zoomed in on S10 which made snapchat unusable or made me put my phone back farther. I remember Samsung kept saying they would fix this through software update but they never did. Thanks	N

Wanting to upgrade to the s22 ultra...	I got the s20 ultra and I was looking at the 22 ultra. The one big thing I didn't like about the 20 ultra was the camera. I don't know what it's called, but its the response time of the camera taking a picture. It seemed very slow for the 108mp setting. Going into lower quality, it seems to take a picture immediately. It could just be my phone, but does the response time for the camera decent? Even for things like motion blur?	N

The S22 series lineup, it could have been the ultimate powerhouse but Samsung missed to little details the SD card slot and the headphone jack and that is a pity!	"I know many people are fine or have accepted the fact that the SD card slot and the headphone jack have been removed from the flagships and will be slowly removed from every device however the S lineup is the ultimate powerhouse for powerusers and the SD card slot and the jack offer the user flexibility if they need it.
Therefore it is a pity that they have been ditched again altogether in what may have been the ultimate phones for 2022.
I hope Samsung changes direction a bit with the next Foldable generation and the next S lineup because they have come back again and are making again good phones after and under tone s20 and s21 lineup I feel and the S22 lineup may have been a very good successor to the wonderful S10 series if it was not for those small 2 details.

S22 Ultra Buyers Remorse?	"I currently own an S10+ which has suited me well until the last couple of months where it will start to randomly select things and I have to restart my phone, clean the screen and get it going again. Happens more frequently than not. But I digress.
I signed up for the pre-order, utter waste of time as the website never loaded. Then when I eventually was able to get through (3 days later), I could pre-order using Verizon financing because to upgrade an existing line I needed to login to my employers business account, which the Samsung link never synced with. Tried to order just a brand new phone with a new number through Verizon financing and always received an error. Ended up going to Verizon direct and missed out on the Samsung credits. Spoke to over 10 Samsung agents throughout the week, none of whom could rectify this. Great. Needs to be through Verizon because my employer will pay for it. 
I'm hoping that when it arrives I'll fall in love with it. Concerned that the Ultra will be not as pleasant to hold as my 10+. Surely it's all an upgrade and I'm going to be wowed upon its arrival? Really just looking for a better camera. Sad to lose my SD card storage, opted for the 512gb.
In reviews I've seen that it doesn't differ much from the S21 Ultra, which I know each iteration is only a slight improvement. Someone tell me I'm in for a treat? Cheers!"	N

Personally I thought they were kind of silly when I got my S9, but now I love them I use them for commonly used apps and contacts and it works me to no end that they're removing them, hell I'm already irritated they removed the expandable storage option from the regular/plus model.  Personally I used to buy a Samsung because of the expandable storage, now they're giving me less and less of a reason to buy a galaxy vs something like a pixel which has longer software and quicker software support"	N
S22 Ultra vs 21 Ultra Battery Test (Exynos)	"[https://youtu.be/Yok\_WszgNmA](https://youtu.be/Yok_WszgNmA)  
Slightly bad news if you're looking to upgrade, although there might be several mitigating factors and the final result is pretty close..."	N
I just checked out the S22s. Wow	Well, wow except for the S22 Note/Ultra. It's probably semi-amazing too, but too big, expensive, fat, heavy, and ugly for lil ol' me. Imagine it with a case - yikes. So I didn't give it any attention. As for the basic and plus - I am in still loving my basic S21, but the screen and the photography of the S22 blows it away. Brighter screen, more colorful pictures, sharper photography (in store). So, the S22 basic is the same width as my S21 basic, but shorter. I don't think I could go back to that, but if you really have small hands, it's a home run. The 22+ is just slightly taller and wider than my S21 and with a case would be at the edge of what I could fit in my pocket. Nevertheless, I am waiting for the battery tests to appear. If the new Exynos (here in EU) is really efficient, then 4500 mah batterty will be just fine for me. I'd be impressed if the 3750 mah on the basic is as good as my current 4000mah, but as I just stated, the size is a bit too small for me now. The only thing I really didn't like, with a brief in-store experience, is that where the edges meet, they feel too sharp, too Apple-y. The S21 feels better that way. Honestly, I think Samsung should have done what Apple does, keep the same frame and size and just update the innards, cameras, and screens.	N

All prepared S22U clear case with tempered glass and Tab S8 Ultra tempered glass. Just patiently waiting for the S22U Sky Blue and Tab S8 Ultra.		N
Why are you not trading your Fold 3 for the S22 Ultra?	I'm not because I came from the S21 Ultra and the S22 Ultra doesn't seem much of an upgrade. I'm not bothered about the camera, barely used my S21 camera. I just smile everytime I open the fold whilst watching content on streaming apps and gaming on this phone is brilliant. Only con is the battery, but I still have 30/40 percent battery when I'm in bed.	N
S22 Ultra or wait for the Fold 4	"Good Evening All,
The title speaks for itself. Should I get the S22 Ulltra or wait for the fold 4. Right now most everything I hear from reviewers about the S22 Ulltra is good especially early indications that the battery will definitely get you through the day no problem and the screen from what I saw at verizon is very large for a phablet. Though I am also tempted to get the fold 4 when it comes out. Thoughts?"	N
Pull the trigger on S22 Ultra- Unlocking?	"Could not pass up the $1,000 trade in. I usually always by unlocked, but Verizon had a much better deal this year. Since it will be locked intially, will I be able to do esim + physical sim? Or do I need to wait 60 days to have them remove the lock.
Side note- The S21 series was very easy to switch between firmwares, will the S22 be the same? So like when i first get it, flash it with the unlocked firmware...or is that 60 day lock gonna stop me from doing it?"	N
Verizons S22 Ultra is not "gimped" lte/5g wise is it?		N
S22 Trade-in Deal question	"Sorry, I know there are a lot of these types of questions floating around. I searched for this specific situation and unfortunately couldn't find any answers.
I was planning on ordering through the Samsung site, not trading anything to Samsung, and then trading in my Galaxy S10 Lite to a physical ATT store. 
I remembered, though, that we have a Note 10+ 5g, in very rough condition. The screen is so cracked that it stays black, but the phone itself does turn on (alarm clock still goes off too). This was my SO's previous phone that was obtained through the NextUp thing; he lost it last year during a hiking trip, but we pay extra for replacements because he's known to not be good with his phones, so he got a new one through ATT. Shortly after, his phone was found, really busted.
I assume that the phone was bricked since we reported it missing. I know that the trade in page says they'll accept Notes in any condition for the $800 credit, but does this include bricked phones? I figured I'd try to trade my S10 Lite to Samsung for 150 off and then trade in the Note 10+ in-store for the 800 credit, but I wanted to be sure first. 
Thanks in advance!"	N
Galaxy S22 Ultra pre Order issue and trade in question	"I originally preordered the galaxy s22+ but Later decided I wanted the Ultra. I canceled the
preorder with a Chat agent. When I did the new preorder and selected the ultra, it went through fine. The Next day I got a cancellation email saying that the line I was upgrading wasn't eligible for the updgrade. The chat rep didn't reset to line status when they canceled the Preorder. So I went back to chat and they did a new pre-order but forgot to add the trade in. They had me call support and they created a new trade in order but got the model wrong. They listed the trade in as a galaxy note 10 but my phone is a galaxys10. He said since galaxies are getting the same trade in value that it doesn't matter what device I send in. So I guess I have two questions:
1) the new pre-order does not list a trade in on the order as it was done separately. The terms and conditions list the undiscounted monthly payment for the phone. Will I get the trade in properly even if it was done outside the order?
2) if the discount should work, am I going to get denied because I am sending a different device in? I was given a website and a confirmation number to track the trade In and it shows the proper offer code but Def also shows the wrong model to be traded in."	N
Pre-ordering S22U at Best Buy (moving from VZW to ATT)	"Hello /r/att —
&amp;#x200B;
My wife and I are looking to move over to AT&amp;T by pre-ordering a pair of S22Us at Best Buy (to get those $200 gift card bonuses). We will be doing this in-person this week. I simply had the question of how pre-ordering works, given that we're switching providers (moving from VZW). Will our phone lines be ported over upon activation? Has anyone had any issues doing this at BB?
&amp;#x200B;
Note: I tried to pre-order online through [Samsung.com](https://Samsung.com) (for the extra bonuses), but being a new AT&amp;T customer seems to limit my checkout option to just one phone as opposed to both of them. Probably a technical error, but I might also be doing something wrong given all the moving parts. To confirm, I have unlocked our numbers for porting over and generated a PIN at Verizon, so that isn't the issue.
&amp;#x200B;
Nonetheless, I'm open to ideas. All help is appreciated!"	N
S22 Ultra Shipping Thread	I figured I'd start an officially unofficial thread related to shipping updates for the S22 Ultra.

If you received a shipping notification or you received your device already, post about it here!	N
You CAN stack T-Mobile promotions with your S22 series order on Samsung.com, but not yet.	"According to T-Force, if you wait for 2/25 when preordering period is over and the device is available for purchase. Directly from T-Force, It means* “At this date, you can purchase it from Samsung directly and qualify for the T-Mobile $1000 off promotion.“*
You cannot order now, because *”If you wish to order the device sooner, it would be required to order it with us to be enrolled in the promotion.”*
So if you have a device that qualifies for $1000 off promotion [on T-Mobile’s website](https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals). You probably could wait for 2/25, buy from Samsung financed over 24 months on T-Mobile EIP, and save money by using a 5% Samsung Referral Code, 7.5% Education Discount, and 12% Cashback code from Rakuten. Which could equate to a free upgrade to Samsung S22 Ultra if you were looking at the Samsung S22+.
Also according to T-Force, *“The trade would be listed on order with Samsung. So essentially, everything will be done with Samsung directly, and they will send the information to us. You wouldn’t have to do anything yourself relating the information to us. This is done automatically with Samsung and us. Once reported to us, you will get an alert that you have been enrolled in the promotion.”* So sounds like Samsung will incorporate the $1000 off promotion into their website."	N

Why is the S22 better than an iPhone for a lifelong Apple user?	I’m a life long iPhone user for no reason other than personal preference. I can easily admit that androids can do significantly more than an iPhone can, but for my daily routine, the lack of specific features doesn’t really effect me. I saw the S21 in a store a few weeks ago and thought it looked amazing. Only a few days later, I saw that the S22 was announced, so I’m definitely intrigued. Ive been having an urge recently to make the switch, but I feel like there are more cons than pros based on my current lifestyle. I communicate with just about everyone in my circle via FaceTime VERY often. Having to switch to Snapchat camera (which we all know is not a very good friend of Androids) I feel would just be all around inconvenient for everyone involved. Additionally, I’m not the most technologically advanced 22 year old around. With a substantial amount of help, I was able to build a beginners-PC which is basically my life’s peak in technological advancement lol. I feel like due to this, I wouldn’t really be making the most of the S22. Let me know what you guys think, because I’m definitely interested in getting this new phone, I just want to have more of a reason to!	N

Upgrade to S22?	I'm currently on a S10+ and considering getting a new phone soon. I can get a S21+, but I heard about the S22 line coming out and may be able to wait for a bit and get one of those instead. Should I just for the S21+ now, or wait for the S22? Is the S22 much better than the S21+. or is that not really known yet? Was trying to decide if it was worth waiting longer for the S22, or if it's too marginal an upgrade compared to a 21+ to even bother.	N

S22+ refresh rate	i just read some article saying that samsung admitted they advertised the refresh rate to be 10-120hz but they just changed it to 48-120hz. isnt that good? bc the higher minimum refresh rate means the phone will run smoother even at it's lowest point	N
What new feature do you wish the new S22 series and Tab S8 series actually came with?	"I have the S20+ and Tab S7+, and although tempted by the T-Mobile and Samsung Store trade-in deals, I am not 100% impressed by the new offerings. As consumers, we have lost a lot of cool and useful features in our Samsungs over the years, and although I can live without them, we should be getting some of the new features on the market at least. A few come to mind:
* Seamless updates with A/B partition (it means after you install an OTA update, you just reset the device: no need to sit at the update screens for 10 minutes)
* LPTO screens in all models/ Variable refresh rate from 1 to 120 hz (helps with battery life;  they are flagships after all, it shouldn't be a S22 Ultra exclusive)
* 256 GB base memory standard (If the micro-SD slot is not coming back, more base storage should be the norm: it costs Samsung pennies on the dollar vs 128 GB UFS)
* Dual-tone LED flash (it somehow fell through the cracks and never got implemented despite really helping flash performance; it's a small ask since Apple uses a quad-tone LED)
What new feature do you wish Samsung would implement on their products moving forward?

S22+ vs S21 Ultra (Battery)	I'm looking for a phone that has good battery and preferably flat screen, but I would definitely prioritise battery after the mediocre battery of my iphone 12. I'm not a big fan of the curve of the S22 Ultra, the S21 Ultra's curve is still okay but I definitely prefer flat screen. Is the battery life of the S21 Ultra significantly better than the S22+?	N
S22+ or IP13?	"I can get both for the same price...
Apple Watch 7 (that I would also need to buy) swings me towards an IP..."	N
Unpopular opinion : the S22 Ultra is a bit small	"Hey, so yeah, I might be in the minority here, but the S22 Ultra feels smaller than what I'd hope for.
I saw one IRL in a phone shop, hold it, played a bit with it, etc.
And while I do agree that it seems like a beast, super smooth and crisp display, wonderful camera, etc. I found it to be... Surprisingly small?
For reference, I come from a Huawei Mate 20X, been 4 years with this huuuuge 7"" display and I didn't think that a 0.2"" difference would be that noticeable.
I'll still get the S22 Ultra as I absolutely love it, but yeah, sometimes I wish for a flagship with the size of my Mate 20X. Maybe a S22 Plus Ultra haha..."	N
Is getting a 256/512GB S22 Ultra for $732/$871 worth getting?	"Okay let me explain my situation.
By doing the math and 
Due to discounts from my carrier, I can basically get a 256/512GB S22 Ultra with a Snapdragon 8Gen1 chipset
for $732/$871, on contract for 2 years.
Or choose to pay it for $30.51/$36.27 per month, for the 24 months.
So only a difference of around $5.76/month 
Or $139 overall between the 256gb and 512gb version 
My personal dilemma is that, I already have an existing Zfold 2 
256Gb Carrier contract for $79.77/month, which will end around September or October of this year 2022
If I were to decide to get an S22 Ultra on contract, I would be spending for both the ZFold 2 and s22 ultra
a total around $110.28/month for the 256gb version 
Or $116.04/month for the 512GB version.
AT LEAST until my Zfold 2 Contract ends on September/October. 
A somewhat big amount but manageable for sure. 
This remarkably cheap promo of the s22 ultra is only available till March 3. 
And of course, I'm planning to keep my Zfold 2. 
I, like most people here, am a smartphone tech enthusiast 
And altho I love my fold 2, the difference when jumping from a Fold to my possibly first ever S/Note series is gonna feel amazing! 
One of the reasons why it is quite cheap is Bcoz of the Preorder discount of $186.97 which I've already included in my calculations 
It also comes with a free silicone cover case  worth $38.93 and a lucky box strap(Idk what this is personally) for $25.30 
If you were in my situation, would you take this promo?
Should I get the 256gb version? To save just a bit? 
Get the 512GB version? For only an extra of $5.76 per month 
Or just not push thru with the S22 Ultra contract deal? 
Your Kind thoughts and opinions on my question would be greatly appreciated!"	N

S22 Ultra Trade In	So, I've decided to swap out my S20+ for the S22 Ultra. I ended up going with Verizon given that they offered more for my S20+ as well as I had some device dollars. After doing so, however, I got to thinking. If I, for whatever reason, decided to leave Verizon before the device is paid off, I know that I would have to pay off the device. Seeing as how the money paid for my S20+ is spread out over the payment period, would I then lose whatever remaining I would have gotten for my S20+? If that's the case, would it not be better to instead do a single payment for the cost of the phone because I would get the full offer amount of my S20+? I have been considering leaving Verizon simply because they don't have the greatest coverage where I'm current at in middle Tennessee.	N
Why is S22 Ultra $100 more when added to cart?	I am looking to buy the Samsung S22 Ultra in the 512gb version. The product shows the price as $1299 because you're getting double the memory for free. However, once it's in my cart the price is $1399 and it doesn't give me any reason why it's $100 more. If I switch to monthly payments they total up to $1299 correctly but I don't want to pay monthly. Other retailers have it for $1299 to buy outright as well. Anyone have any idea why?	N
Galaxy s22 ultra prep order promo with S21 FE	"Hey everyone. I wanted to take advantage of the Galaxy S22 Ultra pre-order deal where you turn in your galaxy S21 for the $800 monthly credits when you have the Magenta Max plan. I swapped my service to Magenta Max, called T-mobile and pre-ordered the S22 Ultra stating that I wanted to take advantage of the promotion. The Rep said no problem and set me up. He said turning in the S21 FE 5g would get me in the promotion l, although I couldn't find that on the website. The pre-order is in and I got an email from T-mobile saying that my turn in value is only $265. Did something go wrong, or is that to be expected for the promotion?
Update: I spoke with T Force and they stated that the Galaxy S21 FE was in fact part of the promotion. They also stated that the turn in value of $265 would be applied to the loan, and the remainder that is part of the $800 on the promotion will then be applied via the monthly billing credits through the 24 months."

Insurance for S22 series	"Hi all,
Have you considered getting, or maybe already got, insurance for your S22 device? It not necessarily has to be from Samsung, could be from any 3rd party. Perhaps you used one before and found it acceptable and could recommend?
Currently debating if I should insure my S22U. Given the price of the phone, it would be a sensible thing to do. On the other hand, the phone now comes with Victus+ glass and enforced frame. Theoretically, this should help protecting the screen from breaking, etc. One can also use case + screen protector.
I am based in the UK, but happy to hear everyone's experiences and recommendations. Thank you"	N

Samsung S22 Ultra or ZFold 3? From Note 20 Ultra, driving me crazy!	"I LOVE the note series. Been faithful since the Note 8.
However, I never, ever, use the S-Pen. I only like it for it's beasty features and the sheer size. I don't like the rounded feel of the previous Ultra series.
I'm stuck between the S22 Ultra or the ZFold 3. I feel the S22U is not a major upgrade from the N20U.. that's why I'm pushed to the ZFold as at least its something exciting and new.

S22 Ultra 1TB availability question. Looking to avert FOMO.	S21 Ultra owner that is interested in upgrading to this version, primarily for storage reasons; the rest of the phone is amazing, but 256GB is woefully inadequate for even my music collection. That said, I only got the 256 because the 512 had been discontinued by the time I pulled the trigger on the phone. I've noticed that the S22 Ultra 1TB is Samsung.com exclusive, and I would love to avoid ordering the phone until, at the very least, more in-depth reviews are posted regarding it. So the question is, is the 1TB model going to be limited in production like the 512GB S21 ended up being?	N

So I gave up and just stuck with my old S9+ for the time being. 
Then my wife's S21 recently started doing the same thing. You can really tell where it's happening if you clean it with some water. The water pools up in the peeling area, instead of beading up and rolling away.
Anybody else experience this? Any signs that the S22 will be different? I've seen it on the different S21's now, but never seen anybody else mention it and don't have this problem on my S9 or my wife's old Pixel 3."	N

Just ordered this phone in 2022 over the S22 Ultra...coming from a S10 plus.. did I make the right choice?	I found a good deal for fairly used good condition note 20 ultra on swappa for $600. Should be arriving in a few days. I'm coming from a S10 plus. I normally switch out my phone every 2 years but after seeing Samsung start removing key features headphone jack and microsd card this made me hold on to my s10 plus for 3 years. If Samsung brought back the microsd card in S22 Ultra I would have most likely updated to that phone instead. I just wanted an upgrade and I feel Samsung will most likely not bring these features back =(. Even though Note 20 Ultra is almost 2 years old now...this felt to be the most logical upgrade for my needs. Did I make the right choice and do you think this phone will still be relevant for the next 2 years which is how long I plan on keeping it for?	N

Considering upgrading from S20 Fan Edition to S22+ but am hesitant due to what I consider data signal issues on the FE. Am I the only one who has encountered this on the FE or other recent Galaxy phones?	"I've had the Fan Edition for just over a year now, and pretty much regret it.  My data signal is only good and fast when I apparently am in an area with a strong signal, and even then, I better not be indoors.  I can go to certain places and buildings that should have a good 5g or LTE signal, but my data is slooow.   I know with certainty it isn't Tmobile because I use my girlfriend's iPhone 6s side to side and hers is fast, whereas I can't even get a google page to load.  Bottom line is, I""m basically wondering if this is a Fan Edition problem or a Galaxy in general problem, or is it just a ""me"" problem?

Currently the Samsung S21 FE has a promotion for either free galaxy buds or $100 in Samsung credit.

At launch, S21 Ultra had worse SOT than S22 Ultra	"So I noticed Android central's [review](https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-review#battery) of the S22 Ultra has dropped on the sub. And there's tons of folks saying the 22Ultra has worse life than the S21 Ultra. I did some digging from last year's [review](https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review) and there's a major discrepancy between both tests. Last year's was 120Hz and QHD+. 
The test for this year is both phones run at 60Hz with no mention to resolution. So take it with a grain of salt from them. I noticed a few people saying they canceled their pre-order, like what? Do your research.
Also, the S21 Ultra has a full year of optimizations. The S22 Ultra is barely getting started."	N

Pre-ordered the S22U, should I get a Tab S8?	"Thinking if I should get a Tab S8 for work/general use since the promo that it comes with the keyboard case is looking really tempting but I'm not sure if I should get one since it's also based on Android so the apps on the tablet should be available on my S22U, and the S22U has an S-Pen with it as well.  
Why or why should I not get the Tab S8?

S22 Ultra with 8GB Ram, will it be noticeable?	"Hi everyone!  
I've ordered an S22 Ultra with 8GB Ram. At the time I thought meh, that should be fine!
However, some reviews and youtubers were skeptical to the fact that it only had 8GB of Ram. That drawing on it would become a bit heavy.
I can switch to a 12GB Ram model, but aside from being more expensive I'll be placed further down the waiting line..
&amp;#x200B;
What do you guys think? How much will I regret that I have 8GB of Ram when using the phone? I'd like to use it for atleast 2 years, preferably 3 years but knowing myself it'll probably be 2 years..  
**I can say**, that I'm very optimized with my phone usage. I always close unused apps, and I maintain the phone in a very optimized manner. (As good as possible) So if I were to draw notes, I would most likely close all other apps, or only have a few open in the meantime.
&amp;#x200B;
Thanks for any advice :)"	N

S22 Plus vs S21 Plus. I've been using an S10 Plus since launch.	"I've had the S10 Plus for almost 3 years now, and it's served me incredibly well. The last few phones that have released have been incredibly underwhelming and Samsung is clearly cuttings costs and downgrading certain features maybe to sell it back to us in future iterations. 🤷‍♂️ 
Anyways I'm looking at two deals both from Best Buy.
S22 Plus 256gb: $999 -$320 Trade in and -$150 in GC so $529 out of pocket.  
S21 Plus 128gb: $699 -$320 Trade in so $379 out of pocket.
S21 pros: Cheaper, Larger Battery, 6.7 inch screen(I do appreciate a larger screen, however idk how much .1 difference will make)
S22 pros: Newer, Larger Storage(but also no expandable storage), and more Ram(Neither will be too useful to me, I'm a light user) 
So honestly only a $150 difference. But I need help from people that have used or tried both phones on which one is better *value*. I will most likely use the new phone for a few years until Samsung releases a notable upgrade. I'd like to get rid of my S10 Plus before the trade in value/resale value becomes worthless."	N
I traded my just bought p6 for an s22+....	"So I saw Verizon was offering 1000 off the 22plus making it 0 a month if you trade in your pixel 4a.  But I just did the trade in promotion which gave me 700 for the trade in with the purchase of the pixel 6.   They didn't want to give me the 1000 for my 4a since I traded it in for the pixel 6 promotion which was only 700$.  But since my trade in 4a hadent arrived to them yet they say I can get the 1000 s22 promo trade in price.  I just felt like the extra 300 in savings and getting a 1000 phone for 0 a month was worth the hastle and 50$ return fee.  So ya I gave the Verizon store my pixel 6 and got an order confirmation # for the s22+ 250 gb which will be shipped to my house.  I didn't have the box for the pixel 6 to return but they didn't seem to mind.  Hope it all goes smoothly.
I had no problems with my pixel 6 so I hope it wasn't a decision I will regret....  Thoughts?"	N

Samsung S10 to Samsung S22 Ultra weight and size	"I am upgrading from an S10 and it is the biggest phone I ever had. The size and weight different to S22 Ultra is insane. 
I really like the specs on the Samsung S22 Ultra but (RANT alert)I am not looking forward to:
* the edge of the phone popping out of shorts &amp; pants
* the sharp corners poking into my hips when sitting down
* getting the phone in and out of your pockets when sitting
* using the phone one handed

Can't decide between the S22+ &amp; Ultra	"So I've been using my S10+ for about 2 years now and I think it's about time for an upgrade.
I'm looking to trade my current device for either the S22 Plus or S22 Ultra. The only thing I don't understand and is my biggest gripe is why did they have to remove the expandable storage/SD card. 256GB for the S22+ (imo) isn't enough &amp; surprised they didn't even have an option for a 512gb variant.
Whilst the Ultra does have higher storage options the curved screen can be annoying a lot of the times, just from experience of using the S10+."	N

Upgrade from S21Ultra to S22Ultra worth it for $153? (fudging the numbers)	"Last few years I've bounced back between the Galaxy Series and the Note Series, I've always loved the pen but admittedly barely use it.  I usually keep each for years before moving on again. I got a S21 Ultra 128 gb in November 2021 so literally months ago, I'm doing the math here and it seems like it's basically $150 for me to upgrade to a S22 Ultra 256 GB. Which would get me
$1,300 - $800 Trade-in = $500 
\- $150 Instant Rebate($100 plus $50 Tmobile activation credit = $350
\-$26.25 Educator discount = $323.74 + Tax = 353.12
And factoring in fudging the numbers to include the $200 samsung credit certificate that leaves a total netloss of  $153 
So $153 gets me a

Now I really like the new S22 ultra and Verizon offers. But I can't upgrade my number A as I'll loose the remaining discount if I upgrade now. I am thinking that I port in another number (let's say number B) and trade in an old device to get $1000 port in gift card and $800 trade in discount. After 4 months when my old device payment is complete, I switch A and B. So old number to the new S22 ultra. And then simply cancel line B (which is now the old line). Can I do that without loosing any credit?

A question about the s22 trade in promotion	So I currently have an S10 that's in perfect condition on att ( I just had the screen replaced, due to a crack) anyways I was curious how it works if I want to keep my galaxy S10 (I have 8 payments left and I have att next up which after reading this subreddit is dumb so I WONT be opting in to that again) I was planning on buying a Google pixel 3 from ebay and trading that in, my question is how would that work exactly if I still am paying off my current phone, which I don't mind just paying off, so that way I have a galaxy S10 that I can sell or give to my fiance? Ultimately what my question is is how does the promotion work if I still have a phone that I'm paying off under contract? Should I pay it off first?	N
S22 trade in question	I go through with the trade in process online, but when i go to check out, it still says that i owe the retail price on the phone, and it isnt giving me the $800 credit option for my note 8. Is this because it is online? Or is it because it is a trade credit, so I pay full price for the phone, and then once they receive my phone, they add 800$ in credit to my line? idk if im making sense, but im a little confused at the moment. Reading the fine print, it appears I pay $800 up front, and then they just add $800 in credit to my line and then I dont pay for the phone on a month to month basis, so essentially just discounting my phone plan + a new phone. Is this correct? Thanks in advance.	N
S22 Trade In	"So, I've got a few questions. I can't find the proper information anywhere and the AT&amp;T store near me hasn't been helpful.
I'm looking to get an S22 Ultra, and I have an S10+ to trade in, but I've never been a fan of ordering a phone from online so I would rather purchase it physically in store on the 25th.
Can I still get the trade in deal on the 25th when I plan to purchase the phone? When does the deal end? Is there actually a chance of me getting an S22 the day it comes out? Is the trade in value online the same as the in store trade in? For example, my S10+ is in perfect condition, other than the back glass being cracked. Online is says the trade in value towards the S22 Ultra is $800, do they honor that in store or is it different?
I'm sorry for the long post. I've never really posted to reddit much and I can't find the info I'm looking for anywhere else, so anything is really appreciated."	N

S10 vs S22+	"So having had my wonderful S10 since it came out I think it's safe to say it's time to upgrade. 
I was comparing the specs on the S10 vs the S22+ and saw this:
S10: **3040 x 1440 pixels, 19:9 ratio, 550 PPI**
S22+: **2340 x 1080 pixels, 19.5:9 ratio, 390 PPI**
Is the resolution worse on the S22+ (I'll be the first to admit I'm not the most tech-savvy).  
My main concern is the fact the resolution on my S10 is one of the things I love the most about it.

S22 Ultra impressions switching from 10 years with iPhones	"Received my S22 Ultra Green - 256GB - Exynos today. Switching from iPhone 11 Pro Max. Been using iPhones since iPhone 4.
**Pleasantly surprised:**
* The screen quality is outstanding
* The device feels just right in the hands.
* 10X zoom is amazing in good lighting conditions. Game changer for me as an ex-pro photographer. 3X zoom is also very good.
* Night mode is ""night and day"" for some situations. Wide angle there is no comparison, iPhone 11 Pro Max was unusable. AF in low light as amazing. But in other situations iPhone wins (read below). Also, ""nightography"" of the stars is amazing, it's not even comparable to the iPhone.
* OneUI 4 is great, responsible and clean, definitely need to get used to it but so far so good.
* Fingerprint scanner is blazing fast, and so is Face unlock, even in pitch black situations.
* Download &amp; installing apps from the Play store is MUCH faster than iPhone's app store (both on WiFi). If I had to put a number I'd say at least 5x faster. Crazy.
* S-pen feels great, really responsive.
* Camera &amp; photos UI (navigating photos and modes etc.) actually feels much more responsive than on the iPhone 11 Pro Max.
**Disappointed / not able to figure out yet:**
* **EDIT : now getting the infamous weird lines on the screen. It's a software issue as often it does not happen. really weird and frustrating... hoping it gets fixed.**
* This thing runs hot... even doing simple stuff like taking pictures.
* Screen brightness setting is way darker than iPhone. I often cannot see the screen unless I manually increase it. Frustrating
* Speaker is inferior to iPhone 11 Pro Max. Not bad, but quieter and not as much bass for sure.
* Cameras struggle with movements. It's a shame because it's just a base settings issue. in Pro mode with high shutter speed, problem gone.
* Camera lens selection is WEIRD e.g. during the night when zooming far, it uses the main lens instead of 10x, and it's extremely noisy and ugly. Once I reach 16x zoom or more, only then it switches to the 10x with less noise.
* 40 MP (and to an extent 108MP) modes are a trap, unfortunately. Dynamic range is inferior and you don't get the scene optimizer thus lose features such as Macro etc. Still nice to have for specific needs in good lighting conditions but otherwise don't bother with it and stick to the base resolution.
* Night mode (main and 3x lenses) sometimes sucks compared to iPhone 11 Pro Max, sort of. It's very weird. sometimes, S22's output is  not as sharp, and the noise removal is way over the top. It does a good job in moderately dark situations , capturing more dynamic range than iPhone 11 (but with blurry patches...). Quite disappointed with this one - I need to test it out more.
* The battery consumption is really high, so far. But it usually improves in the first days from what I've read.
* S-pen is not that easy to pull in and out, especially with a case on. I sometimes leave it in but with the click-tip ""pushed out"" for easier access, but I fear I might damage it this way.
* No silent mode button: I'm lost and still can't figure out how to switch from normal to silent mode on Android.
* Smart Switch (to transfer data from another device) is bugged. I selected only contacts and wifi settings and it marked 3 hours required for the transfer. I gave up after a minute.
* As much as I dislike Siri, Google assistant is even worse, surprisingly. It does understands phrases with good accuracy, but it's quite slow when it comes to taking an action and understanding what I say. I need to play more with it though.
Overall, I'm **very** happy with the S22 Ultra, despite the few quirks. I look forward to testing more and getting the hang of it. If you have any tips or suggestions, please share! Thanks for reading."	N
Went from S9+ to S22 thinking I'd want a compact phone again, but I think I want the S22+ now.	"Anyone else having regrets with the smaller S22? I guess that's why phone manufacturers keep making the bigger sizes. I got so used to how to handle my s9+ size that going back to a small screen is a downgrade except for putting in my pocket. With the grippy rubber case on my s9+ I was able to have it just lay on my 4 fingers without slipping out of my hand and I could still stretch and hit most buttons, but now when I try to 2-hand type and everything  on my s22, it feels too cramped. Maybe a case will make it a bit bigger feeling.  
I'm gonna go to the AT&amp;T store today to see if they'll  let me try out some cases and the S22+"	N

Form over function - S22 Plus vs S22 Ultra	"My S22 Plus is coming in tomorrow according to FedEx, but now I am having second thoughts and wondering if I did in fact made the right decision.  Did anyone else also choose the S22 Plus over the S22 Ultra? I feel like I am making a mistake, but I am not sure.
The S22 Ultra is nice, but I can't stand the following things:
* Way too big for my pockets and hands
* Really dislike the boxy design which I know is going to get annoying for me over time.
&amp;#x200B;
The S22 Plus is nice, but I am not a fan of the following things:
* No 10x zoom for the camera.  - (This also bothers me quite a bit)
&amp;#x200B;
That said, I understand the S22 Ultra has the S Pen, but to be honest I don't mind not having it at all, so I am really just torn whether choosing a 10x zoom lens, or a comfortable body. Another way I see this is whether it's better to be sad every time I hold/pocket my phone due to its size but be happy whenever I take a zoomed in picture OR to be sad every time I zoom in to take a picture but be happy every time I hold/pocket my phone. 
&amp;#x200B;
Was anyone else in this boat? What did you choose? What do you think I should choose?"	N
S22 Ultra Black Window on Side	"I just received my s22 today. I noticed there's an oval black window about the size of the volume button on the right side of the phone. Does anyone know what this is? Some sort of sensor? I couldn't find anything by googling.

Today's the day! S22 Ultra out for delivery!	Lmk if you have any questions I'll do my best to film the unboxing!	N
S22 Ultra delivered today	"T-mobile, green 512GB upgrading from ceramic white S10+ 8GB RAM.
First impressions generally track with what's been released in the media thus far. 
It's big. The S10+ in a Spiggen ultra hybrid case actually fits into the Spiggen Neo Hybrid case I have for the Ultra. I prefer larger phones, so this is OK.
It's very fast. Coming from a three year old phone, the increase in speed is very noticeable. The S10+ is still a very capable phone, it's just showing its age. Can't comment on speed difference versus newer models, so your experience may differ. 
S-Pen is fantastic, accurate, fast to use, and tracks perfectlyOn board pen stowage  is a huge plus. I had the Note 4, and actually still have a Note 7 and I forgot how much I missed having the stylus. The 22 Ultra could easily be branded and sold as a new Note. 
The screen is fantastic and being true 1440p is an excellent plus. Not really a surprise with Samsung's reputation for display quality. 
Transferring the contents of the S10+ to the Ultra was painless. It comes with USB C to C cable, which I used with Smart Switch, or it can be done through wireless. It took about an hour and a half to transfer every account, app, media, messages, and all settings, about 350+ GB of data in total.  You can pick and  chose what to transfer if you don't want everything to copy over. 
No factory screen protector, which sucks and is my biggest gripe with the whole experience. Make sure to order one when you get a case. 
While it's a gorgeous phone, It's incredibly slippery and I have concerns that the sharp edged corners would transfer increased force into the phone if it were dropped increasing the likelyhood of breaking the glass. A case with good corner padding is a must IMO, for protection and preventing it slipping out of your hand or off something.
No comment on battery life just yet, I've only been using it for around an hour after the transfer finished. I'm assuming, like previous models, it will learn usage patterns to adjust and adapt for best battery life.
I'm quite pleased overall and looking forward to getting acquainted with it over the next couple days."	N

S22 Ultra S-pen menu stuck/duplicate bug	"S22 Ultra S-pen menu stuck/duplicate bug
Anyone else have this?
Have been using my 512Gb exynos version for about a week now and have this happened twice. 
I have the popup menu set to appear at the right side but when this but happens the menu goes up on the opposite side. 
Then when i put it the pen back it doesn't close.
I pull out the pen again and the proper menu goes up on the right side but I lose all control the display exept the current S-pen menu. 
If I try to use an S-pen button on the new menu and i can for example draw a screenshot but then i can't press the save button (managed to take this screenshot using the hardware buttons power+volume). 
If i now put the pen back the new menu sticks. 
And if i pull out the pen again there are a new menu on top of the stuck one and now that one is the only thing I can get to respond on the screen. 
The only other things i can do at this point is the pull up / down gestures from outside the display to to home or pulldown the quick toggles.
Only way to get control of the phone again is a hard reset with the powerbutton+volume until it reboots.

S22 Ultra - big performance issue	I got my S22 ultra 512GB yesterday (exynos 2200) and I tried playing some games like PUPG, Asphalt 9 or COD mobile and its really not good. On COD I cant even choose higher grafic settings and the games look terrible. My friend has a I phone XR and PUPG is way more fluent. What can I do or what could be the reason?	N
S22 Ultra battery life	I got my S22 Ultra in yesterday at like noon and the battery life is idk fine I guess anyone else who has got theirs have you noticed it being bad? Well not bad but not stellar. Maybe it's because I'm moving from the 13 Pro Max (your opinions of apple irrelevant the battery life on that phone is next to none) I'm just too used to that? Like even now I unplugged my phone drove to work and I'm at 97% it was fully charged idk I have the Green 512GB model if that means anything. I've had the note 20 Ultra and the s21 Ultra and the z fold 3 so I'm not new to Samsung but not a lifelong user is there battery saving things I can do in settings or idk what	N

Mundane things about the S22U	"For context, I have the T-Mobile 256GB Burgundy S22U.
The box itself is very thin. The cameras have a bit of a bump to them, so I recommend a case to keep them from getting scratched. The S Pen is black, as expected, but it's also covered in a grippy plastic that reminds me of rubber. 
The SIM card slot is down by the charging port and very small. During setup, the top of the phone next to the cameras gets a little toasty. 
There is a plastic chunk on the right side that looks like the same plastic you peeled off earlier. This is something 5G antenna related.
Both Google Messages and Samsung Messages come preinstalled. Just like the other apps, you have the option to choose. Facebook is no longer a required app. You can uninstall it as usual.
Will update as I continue using the phone."	N

Galaxy S22 Exynos owners reporting defective devices	"Many early adopters of the Exynos S22 Ultra seem to be experiencing an issue with their phones where a column of pixels is displaying jumbled data. This *typically* is a hardware issue, caused by a loose display cable or fault in the display or GPU.

Might return my S22+. Odd situation. I have questions.	"So, I just scored an S20+ for $200. Amazing deal on a still pretty solid phone. I have an S21+ I was going to trade in, but I'm considering keeping both the S20+ and S21+ and the $550 I paid and putting it all toward a Z Fold 4 later on, or perhaps even the S23 series.
Anyway, the geek in me thinks it would be neat to compare three generations of plus models beside each other for a couple of days, then ship the 22+ back within return window.
...however, part of me wants to refrain and not open it since I'm pretty sure I'll be returning it anyway. If I opt to do that, I can probably catch the FedEx guy and refuse the package, and they'll send it back, but I'm not sure if I should notify Samsung about the return/refund first?

S22 Ultra Exynos Question	"Hi all,
Hope you are all enjoying your new S22's or eagerly awaiting delivery!
I've just been down to my local Curry's to test out an S22 Ultra in person - Luckily they had them on show and I managed to have a good play around with one and came away quite impressed. Sadly, it was bolted down so I couldn't test the Camera's or get a feel for the shape &amp; weight. ! I think what most impressed me (Apart from the display which looked outstanding!) was, surprisingly, the S Pen...Super smooth and just fun to play with.
Anyways, what I wanted to ask, was that I couldn't help but notice that the UI was quite ""stuttery"" and a little ""laggy"" - I wasn't doing anything intensive, just moving around the UI and browsing via Chrome. I know the Exynos has gotten a lot of flack, and justifiably so, but my understanding was that after Samsung moved from in-house cores to ARM, the Snapdragon &amp; Exynos CPU's were neigh on the same?
The only thing I did notice was that the phone was in ""Demo/Retail Mode"", so I didn't know whether that had something to do with it? I thought this was more to do with limiting certain pieces of software to make it ""showroom ready"" and wouldn't really effect performance but I may well be wrong.
Could I kindly ask whether anyone with an Exynos variant also suffers with a laggy/stuttery UI?"	N

If the OM5 has a wider grasp I'll go pick up up but was hoping someone has played around with this already as I have to go shoot some video next week.	N

Does FedEx notify when a package is going out for delivery?	I ordered my S22 the 9th, and it's been at the sort facility closest to me since Sunday, the 20th and has not moved. It's not that close to me so I assumed it would be sent off some other place closer so they can deliver. My thing is, it's still saying it's at the sort facility and I'm wondering if it's going to notify me that it's going out for delivery because it's set to arrive today, the 22nd. I need to get out of school on time so I don't know if its really going out today.	N

Stuttering when scrolling and typing S22 Ultra Exynos	"Good day everyone,
I have the phone for almost five to six days now and I am getting annoyed at the fact that this phone stutters a lot. When I scroll in Apps you can see the lagg when scrolling, and often when I type something on the keyboard the keys get stuck and then after 3 seconds or something everything that I wanted to type will be typed in rapid speed. It's almost as if the chip is stuck or something and needs to catch a breathe with the intense task of simply typing.
The stuttering happens randomly on OneUI, when you scroll through the apps or you open basic apps like Gmail or Keep Notes or the news, the animation simply isn't fluent. When I go to FHD mode instead of WQHD the problem is somewhat mitigated, it's really as if the chip is not able to handle the resolution or something. Very unoptimized.

Thoughts after one week using S22 Ultra (exynos)	"I got my phone last Saturday. I spent Sunday setting it up and brought it to a cabin with the family last week.
Usage is never normal for the first week or so for me. Installing apps, playing with the phone more, using the camera more, so I'm still up in the air regarding battery use. I've had to charge it every day with my old 18W Samsung charger, which has been fine and fairly quick. I just got a new 65W PD charger which I am looking forward to trying.
So far everything is fluid and snappy. I feel a bit more backgrounding of apps compared to my old P30 Pro, especially resuming whatever I was playing last on Spotify or Pocket casts it takes a couple of seconds to resume playback after I have been listening last. Sound is better on my Buds+ thanks to adaptive sound profiles catering to my busted hearing after too many rock concerts.
The camera bump is annoying but I am waiting for my case, which I hope will reduce the table wobble, which is really pronounced.
Speaking of the camera, it's apparent that something is amiss with the shutter when capturing movement. My daughter is two and does not stand still for me to take photos of her, and it feels like I am discarding 20 photos of her for each one which is in total photos. This is my biggest gripe right now. Video is awesome and the selfie camera is unreal, but I've missed out on capturing some great moments this past week.
The wobble is very annoying when using the S-pen. The phone is hard to hold in one hand and putting it on a table is not an option as the wobble is so pronounced. Again I hope that a case will help with that as well as making it easier to grip.
All in all its a great phone, but it could be better still. I really hope that Samsung will fix the shutter issue in a software update.
EDIT:
I've had two spontaneous reboots, that I haven't been able to replicate. Last night, my phone rebooted when I pressed the side button twice to launch the camera (because fuck bixby) while it was charging. Just rebooted. I haven't been able to replicate it.
Then again this morning my podcast stopped when I put my phone in my pocket, and I thought I must have stopped it. Turned out the phone was just rebooting. It wasn't hot or anything."	N

Can't set up the phone without a SIM card?	"I just got my S22 delivered, yay! When I pressed start on the opening screen, it said to enter a SIM card and didn't allow me to proceed until I did. I like to keep my card in my old phone until the new one is fully set up so I can still make/receive calls and texts as needed, because full setup can take a while. This is the first time I had this happen. I don't know if this was done by the phone, carrier, or both, but I have not experienced this with other phones on T-Mobile including other Samsung phones. I actually got an A32 5G free from T-Mobile last year, and I set it up without a SIM card so I can explore the UI and features. I had never had a Samsung phone until the A32 5G and I was very impressed and decided on Samsung for my next phone if they made a small one.
So is T-Mobile or Samsung moving towards forcing the user to use the phone with a service line if it's bought through the carrier? Kinda cringe if so. They didn't even include a SIM card which is okay for me because I had one, but what if I didn't?

Samsung s22 ultra black screen issues (exynos)	"Hi all,
I have had my 512gb matte black s22 ultra (exynos) for about 1 week now and wanted to document a few of the issues I have come across. 
1) The phone is sometimes difficult to wake from ""deep sleep"". That is, if I leave the phone overnight it sometimes takes 5-10 presses of the power button to wake up the phone.
2) the screen randomly goes black when scrolling in chrome. This is a very odd issue. I tried using screen recorder to capture the behavior, but even if screen goes black the screen recorder shows everything still (and the webpage even continues scrolling.

Anyone switch from Pixel 6? What is your experience?	"Hi,
I have a Pixel 6 and have been using Pixels for the last couple of years, but have had a few problems with the Pixel 6, which I'm starting to get tired of.

S22 Ultra lag?	"Hello everyone, 
The last Samsung/Android phone I've had was a Galaxy S8 and I was pretty happy with it, it wasn't always smooth but it is what it is. Since then I have used an iPhone Xs and now an iPhone 13 Pro Max but the switch to the S22 Ultra is really tempting. So I went to my local store to play with the S22 Ultra and it had a few moments when it did lag quite badly and had a few hiccups (Exynos variant) which I find unacceptable since it is such an expensive phone. On the other hand I have a friend that bought a S21 Ultra at launch that claims he has never had any lag or hesitation. My question is why did it lag? Do you guys experince the same issues on your S22s/older Samsungs?"	N

\- Haptic Feedback feels quite nice, I would say it's an improvement over Note 20 Ultra  
\- Speakers seem pretty much the same as Note 20 Ultra  
\- Phone feels VERY fast  
\- Kinda have buyers remorse I didn't get the 512 Model to be honest  
\- I use my phone all day when at the office ( usually streaming youtube vids while I work with headphones on, wifi, bluetooth ) - I'll give a battery impression when the day is over with. Only had two charge cycles so far. On my Note 20 Ultra, I would have to charge the phone before leaving the office because it would be around 30% by 5pm  
\- Phone feels heavier/more solid. Obviously it IS heavier, but you can really feel it.  
\- Be careful when swapping SIM CARDS!!! The speaker hole is right next to the sim ejection HOLE! How many people are going to shove the ejection tool into the wrong hole?? ( I DID! )"	N

Dome Glass and UAG Monarch Kevlar combination on S22 Ultra?	"Hey there

[S22U] ZAGG Fusion Curve with D3O Screen Protector, bad experience	"Got my 512GB white Ultra from Verizon today and got ready to install the ZAGG Fusion Curve with D3O that I got directly from ZAGG ([https://www.zagg.com/en\_us/fusion-curve-d3o-galaxy-s22-ultra](https://www.zagg.com/en_us/fusion-curve-d3o-galaxy-s22-ultra)). Between the barebones instructions and the process itself, I separated the adhesive layer from the screen protector itself. It comes with a tray for installation, but the phone sits too deep in the tray for the adhesive layer to stick properly. Even applying pressure with the squeegee, this adhesive layer comes right up, allowing dust to magically reappear every time.
I put in for a warranty replacement, but they currently don't have any in stock for warranty replacements, of course. Hopefully I keep the screen damage-free in the meantime. Has anyone else tried this screen protector yet and had any experience, good or bad, with installation? I've installed ZAGG before on my iPad and my Switch without issues, but the process with the S22U and this model was a little different."	N

Upgrade from S10 (normal sized)?	"I have skipped the S20 and S21 due to the overall specs and materials seemingly being a downgrade 😕 but i quite like the S22 stuff. Issue is I do not like the sizes of the plus and Ultra models, too big for everyday out and about use.  How would the gurus rank the S10 next to the S22? Only ""downside"" i see is the screen PPI. Would going from 550ppi to just north of 400 be quite a shock (on simmilarly sized displays)? Cheers.
Samsung did set the bar high with the S10 (normal sized), and the following ""smallest of the family"" flagships were lacklustre in comparison ☹️
I am no ""power user"" by any means, but i do like a crispy display and decent cameras. The lack of 3.5mm jack would be an issue as i use mine daily after the buds go flat.. but i guess having 2 sets of buds if i preorder the s22 would solve that."	N

No SD no problem, well sorta.	"So Samsung has released a USB drive that'll plug into the USBC port of the S22 devices.

SmartSwitch: useful hints and guidance to avoid issues?	"Hi All: 
i have always been a bit nervous whenever i use SmartSwitch to transfer data from my current phone to the incoming new generation phone. often, it works well. once in a while, there are hiccups. 
may i please ask if anyone has good tips and hints that would be helpful to avoid issues please? 
in particular, of all the options this SmartSwitch app gives us, are there any to be concerned about and best to not use? should we be particularly careful about any particular steps please? 
there is hardly anything at all written up and included with all Samsung's new phones, so i always feel that i'm doing this in the dark! 
thank you in advance."	N
US purchased phone has non-US IMEI	"This is the 2nd request today for a mod to fix my typo - please change IMIE to IMEI and TIA! 
I attempted to register my new S22U for Samsung Care + and received an error that the IMEI wasn't a valid US number. I just got off the phone with Samsung and was told this is a known issue and the case is being escalated. So, just a heads up, to check your IMEI for it's registered location"	N
Haptic feedback and notification vibration	"Hi everyone,  
Just received my S22 ultra and enjoying it for the most part but I remember some people talking about a lesser known advantage was the haptic feedback and notification vibration was supposed to be a lot better 
From my experience it is the same at best anyone else notice this, was this improvement to this feature abandoned or am I just not seeing it on the settings?

Did you trade?	"Just curious what phone everyone traded in for their S22 (if you did trade)?  
How much did you get, and from where (Samsung, Carrier, etc.)? 
Good deal?  
I actually did not trade this year because I have all pixel phones and the market on Samsung or carriers wasn't good for Pixels. I will probably be trading my S22U for the S23U next year though..."	N
Unicorn Beetle Pro doesn't work with wireless stand!	"So i have the samsung fast wireless charging stand and it doesnt work with it. Apparently the case doesnt rest up against it enough to charge due to the bottom lip of the charger. Works fine without a case on.

Face Unlock Very Fast	I set up face unlock which I have never used on any phone before. It is instantaneous. I was adding a new cc to Google Pay and it now requires a lock screen that I don't typically use. I tried setting a pin, but that was too much of a hassle. Fingerprints can be a little cumbersome too so I thought I would try face unlock. I am impressed.	N
45 Watt charging is just a number	"Like many of you I am Ultra excited to get my new device. Since I ordered a custom color I know my wait will be long so to pass the time I've been watching as many videos on the S22 series, mostly the Ultra, as there are being released. I don't care for the camera videos too much because most of the images look the same to me on screen. With the announcement of 45 Watt charging though I've found a new category of video, the charging comparison, which has lead to some new discoveries. Like did you know that OnePlus has an 80 Watt charger? Yeah neither did I.  
Which brings me to the title of this thread. I thought if 25 Watts was fast 45 Watts would be ridiculously fast. I mean it's almost double, right. Well imagine my disappointment when 45 Watt charging is only 12 minutes faster than 25 Watt charging. Yeah you read that right. I've watched about 3 videos now and in the first one I watched the difference was like 3 or 4 minutes. I couldn't believe it so I went looking for another. I found the one attached in this thread. The difference being that the vlogger specifically mentions that not only do they have a 45 Watt charger but they also have the thicker cable recommended to be used with it. This all sounded promising and I thought that is the key, but 45 Watts ended up only being 12 minutes faster than 25 Watt charging.  
In both videos the S22 Ultra failed to reach 50% by 20 minutes, which is what they claim, but only by a few percentage points each time. Somewhere in the neighborhood of 44%. Even so 44% after 20 minutes still works out to a full charge at around 50 minutes. The charging cycle really must slow down as it approaches a full charge, which most of us know and expect, but a mere difference of 12 minutes is very unexpected. The vlogger even states that they performed the test multiple times with similar results.  
So what do you think?   "	N
S22 Ultra First Impressions	"Got my VZW S22 Ultra yesterday. 
Upgraded from Note9.  
Phone arrived before my case, so I am caseless at the moment. 
Protruding camera lenses seem to gather pocket lint very quick. 
Hard to use while laying flat on a desk as well.  
Vibration motor seems VERY WEAK. 
I miss not having an LED notification light on the front face.  
Also, on my note9 I could unlock screen with a hard press on the lower middle portion of screen. I miss that! 
Camera is great
Screen is great 
Speakers are just okay. 
No headphone jack or SD card doesn't really bother me.  
Overall, feels like a great upgrade from Note9."	N

Disabling 5G?	Anyone figured out a way to do so? I tried doing the \*#\*#4636#\*#\* code and it went to LTE and after a few seconds switched back to 5G.

Has anyone found any good folio wallet magnetic detachable cases?	I got the Clear protective case from Samsung and I was considering the Spigen CS case, but I opted for the VRS Design Damda Glide Pro for a little bit more space. This case is already a bit thicker, so I have been looking over folio cases. I don't like the normal design where you flip the folio around and show off that you have credit cards to the world. I think I'd like a nice folio to put everything I need in it, including cash, but have the main part of the case be detachable so I can remove it when I want to use the phone in public. Anyone have any suggestions?	N

Samsung official standing protective cover vs Spigen vs ??	"Hey ppl,
since Rhinoshield cases are not available yet, I bought both the Spigen Neo Hybrid (as it is IMO the best spigen case: awesome protection with precise camera cutouts) and the official protective standing cover for my soon to arrive s22 ultra.
Does anybody have experience with especially the standing cover so far? Also how was the protection level with these in recent years? It kinda feels like the Spigen ones are better designed for weakening the drop impact.. 
It also seems to me, that the side lips (just like for the neo hybrid apparently) do not go above the screen. This is only the case for top and bottom lips. Do the side lips exceed the screen height in any other Spigen case? Maybe tough armor?"	N

Screen Protector Recommendations?	"Hi guys,
My S22 Ultra came yesterday! Absolutely love it! I jumped on buying a glass screen protector for the new phone however I was extremely disappointed. There is a obvious circle where the thumb print sensor should be which is very off putting as it's constantly visible, the black rim has a number of defects (randomly flicks up, as if it was following a pattern of a smaller phone), and the product should have come with protectors for the cameras too, which it didn't. Can't complain to seller on amazon as the seller has conveniently 'ceased trading'.
&amp;#x200B;
Anyway, my post isn't about complaining about that -  I normally get screen protectors off of recommendations, so even know it's incredibly early days for this phone, are any of you guys aware of/ can recommend any particular (hopefully inexpensive) tempered glass screen protectors that I can get a replacement for?"

Can the S22 be rooted?	"I'm used to rooting all my phones mainly so I can install titanium backup and freeze various apps and services that cannot be uninstalled. Helps with battery life and unclutters my phone.

Preorder or wait for BestBuy?	"So BestBuy seems to be doing the same deal as Samsung; 100 discount, price match lower storage, gift card. Yet, you can't even buy on their site.

S22 Ultra terrible battery life - I set it up using SmartSync transfer from my Note 20 Ultra	"I have two S22 Ultra's. One of them I set up from scratch, the other I restored everything including Settings and Home Screen configuration from my Note 20 Ultra.
The one that I set up from scratch has decent battery life. The one that I set up based on the Note 20 Ultra has terrible battery life. I'd probably barely get 3 hours SOT with this.
The battery status for both devices are still calibrating, but since I am in the unique position of having two exact same devices, just set up differently, I'm pretty sure there's something wrong with the one I set up using Smart Switch.
I am going to factory reset and set up from scratch on the device with poor battery life.
My recommendation to everyone setting up their new phones is not to restore any Settings or configuration. Media would probably be fine to restore.
Also, since I know will get asked, both devices are Exynos. But I don't think that is important here.
Edit: I used Samsung Smart Switch, not SmartSync. I am unable to edit the title of this post to correct it."	N

Can I Recommend Upgrading to the S22?	"We're obviously going to spend a lot of time in this group talking about the new S22 and the decision to upgrade or not. As such, I thought I'd offer the following:
I had the pleasure of daily driving the 22+ for the last week. I work for a mobile software development company, so I get to test drive the coolest hardware. However the S21+ is my ride or die daily driver. It was largely the same with the S10 and S20, the Galaxy S line is just consistently my favorite Android Phones. I say that so you’ll understand just how excited I was for my turn with Sammy’s latest and greatest. So I thought I’d weigh in on the upgrade question. 
Subjectively, the camera and image processing are maybe a 10-15% increase in quality, on par or surpassing anything from Cupertino or Palo Alto. Screen quality is largely the same, though the increased brightness on the S22+ meant that in full daylight my display still looked beautiful. Running some high demand apps simultaneously, I noticed a surprising increase in computing power from the S22's Snapdragons 8 Gen 1. Its fast folks. Like really FAST. It ran through Genshin Impact without so much as a stutter. It must be said though that the S21's 888 tore through the workload at a pace that wouldn't leave anyone reasonably wanting more. I also noticed an increase in battery life by about 4-6 hours, from a smaller battery no less. Most likely, this is attributable to the  new chip's efficiency and a more variable refresh rate on the screen. 
Here's the Bottom Line: Samsung didn't take a huge generational leap with the S22, so there's no big risk feature to focus on. As such, the S22 is a little boring, but for all the right reasons. Samsung took what was already the best Android phone experience and just dialed up what we already loved. Put more simply, it just works. It's hard to complain about a phone that doesn't deliver a perfect 10 in every category, but never let's any area drop below a 9. If you love the S21, you're going to love S22, but you won't be surprised by any massive advancement in capability. It's still a Sammy though, so you know you're still guaranteed to get the best tech.
I won't be trading in my S21+ anytime soon, but I wouldn't blame anyone who buys the S22 to get just a little bit more of what you already love."	N
Switched to the S22 Ultra or did I 😮🤔		N
Upgraded from S20 to S22	You wouldn't think going from a 6.2 inch screen to a 6.1 inch screen would be noticeable, but its a big difference. Also no more options to change the resolution; you will have a 120hz refresh rate whether you want it or not!	N
S22 Ultra is going back... Fold here I come	"So I'm not loving the S22 Ultra.  It's super heavy or at least it feels heavier than my old fold 2.  Must be down to it's width and weight distribution.
I have found a Fold 2 available for 450 usd and a Fold 3 for 600usd.  
I Loved my Fold 2, used it without a case from day 1, but did eventually manage to break it.  All my fault.  Insurance paid out but got the Ultra instead.  I'm debating on going back to the Fold as they are more fun and useful when reading in bed or for general media consumption.
What do you guys think about choosing either the Fold 2 or 3.  I use to use the selfie cam on the inside screen a lot to take pics with the kids.  The Fold 3 under screen camera looks like sh\*t, and i'm hearing the battery is bad.

Can I exchange my s22?	So I bought the s22 and it says it will be here tomorrow and I can't wait, BUT after reading some reviews online I'm wondering if the s22 is enough of an upgrade for me ( I'm upgrading from an S10) I like the size of my S10 the way it fits in my hand and all that but Im wondering if it will be enough or should I have upgraded to one of the other models?

Upgrade to S22 series. Need help	"I am stuck and in need of help. I have gone through all the posts on how to stack the $800 AT&amp;T offer with Samsung offers. But I am here with more questions than answers:
Currently, I have two 10+ and one S10 on an old 12GB plan which I am willing to upgrade to Unlimited plans.
All three phones are paid off.
I have a few S7 Edge as well as S3 in my drawer, all of them work, but have cracked screens, and other cosmetic damages.
I am willing to part with all these phones if needed.
Now, I go to Samsung website, and went through the  ordering process. I can get $240 instant credit for each S10+ and in the same ballpark for S10. Then I select AT&amp;T payment plan and go further, I don't see any option for the $800 bill credit or a box to enter the promo code.
At this point I got nervous and got out. I guess I am not confident about how AT&amp;T knows I will be trading in another phone?

Samsung eSIM transfer issues on the S22 Ultra? Here is what you need to know.	"* First thing you will need to do is remove the eSIM from the old phone.
* From your new S22 Ultra, you will need to get past the first setup screen
* On the first setup screen, push the volume-down key for 5-seconds and then tap next. This will allow you to setup without a SIM card, which later you will be able to install an eSIM.

My S22 Ultra got delivered on TWOsday, 02/22/2022 at 2:22PM. Samsung and FedEx,. I'm amused.		N
Got my S22U in SG!	"Had a pleasant surprise to be the first to get an S22U in Singapore to receive the phone, just because I'm the 22nd shoper in the ecommerce platform! Best part? Additional freebies (got the duo wireless charger, powerbank, and buds 2)! Yay!
Currently using the S22U to post this, and definitely love the smoothness of the phone. Although it looks similar to the N20U (which I own), I'm actually quite happy with this switch."	N
WARNING: S22 Ultra Users looking for cases	"Do not buy cases with any sort of magnets on the back of the case. It will cause disturbance with the S-pen and cannot use it!
Just found out today after figuring out why my S pen kept failing the diagnosis checks. 
Thanks for the attention! Have fun!"	N
Flash Review of the S22 Ultra (512GB SD)	"Hey, y'all! Got my S22 Ultra in the mail today and I had some thoughts:
* Speed is impressive, right off the bat you can see the performance gains from even just a few generations ago.
* The rubberized s-pen is a great move! Much easier to grip and it's a lot more comfortable.
* The write-on-any-textbox feature on OneUI 4.1 is phenomenal!
* The battery life is to be seen, but I'm hopeful.
* Night photography and the camera, in general, are the best I've seen on a smartphone, with app integrations it is a serious competitor to the iPhone.
* OneUI 4.1 overall has some great quality of life changes.
Now some notes:
* Those graphical glitches on Exynos? Yeah, they're on the Snapdragon too. This is 100% a software issue, I had it to less of a degree on my Note 20 Ultra and it exists in the same places too (fullscreen videos, unlocking with face). It's not bothersome but something to keep in mind.
* Cooling is not significantly better, that may change once I get normal usage patterns set*.*"	N
Anybody order early and still not have their S22U ship yet?	"I ordered a Burgundy S22U 256GB T-Mobile Version through the Shop Samsung App on 2/10 and it still hasn't shipped yet, it says ""Backordered"" ""Will ship week of Feb 23, 2022"". Anybody have the same thing?
Edit: I looked up the order on the website instead of the app, and there it shows an arrival date of 3/11. The Anybody else order a carrier version on the 10th and already get it?
Edit2: support chat sys that the delivery date is scheduled for the 25th still but FedEx doesn't show any incoming packages."	N
Day 2 report : S22 Ultra reboots by itself + screen artifacts. Disappointed :(	"Hi - I've switched to Samsung after 10 years with Apple. I loved my experience with S22 Ultra (Exynos) on Day 1. But after using the device more, I'm starting to regret the switch.
1. I get weird lines on the screen whenever doing random things like taking a note, watching a YT video etc. This is not hardware related it seems, as sometimes it disappear. It's very frustrating. 
2. My device reboots by itself, almost like if it was ""overheating"". It happened 4 times now, in different scenarios (e.g. just now, I was simply taking a picture)
I don't know if it's Exynos related or S22 Ultra in general, but I would be cautious before buying. I'm sure tons of people do not experience these issues, but if this affects my device and it wasn't detected by Samsung's quality control, I assume it can happen to others as well."	N
S21 fe for 400 or s22 for 100 more?	Besides camera improvements is their any other reason I should consider getting the s22 over the s21 fe?	N
my review of the s22 ultra after using it for a few weeks now	"the s22 ultra is the first phone in years that i considered keeping i am still whithin the return window of swedish law and this one had a weird triangle error when charging for the first time so i want to swap it any way 
here are my thoughts
this is by far the most beautiful phone i've seen it even outmatched sony and i loved their phones adored them untill the xperia xz3 which is where i stopped loving them, this phone is like a true successor to the sony xperia xz series the old notes had a weird hybrid tube design where corners were slightly curved this is a perfect symmetrical tube design, i have seen a lot of people complain about the camera lenses design but i adore this design it's subtle and exactly like the xperia xz1 it's a perfect camera design just perfect and i will take that over a huge unnecessary bump any day, the lenses are what counts why fill space around them with useless pieces, i am so happy they didn't go with the weird thumbs down p shape that we thought, and ofcourse i hate the ce markings as they are beautymarks on something like this which is so beautiful.
screen, this is the first time i am in love with a screen from samsung, earlier models suffered from lack of brightness and a yellow tint see example but i also like really cold displays with a high brightness so i may be biased when i say this so experience may vary.

[taltigolt på Twitter: ""this is what i mean abou tthe note 10+ screen simply not being good enough here i am comparing i tto the mate 10 pro which white looks best to you? and may i add the note 10+ is at the coldest possible display setting with intensive mode so it sshould have a blue tint it doesn't https://t.co/AykPLMyOfb"" / Twitter](https://twitter.com/ZZCOOL/status/1177292994740924417)  
samsung refused to acknowledge this even samsung care didn't see an issue i sold the note 10 at a loss for this reason
&amp;#x200B;
even my old huawei mate 10 pro was brighter than the note 10 , this display doesn't it's bright and vibrant theres a setting in advanced options that boosts the brightness even further and that to me was the sweetspot in brightness, it's a display i approve with my perfectionism, i fully approve this display, not even the sony xperia mk1 was bright enough as it was limited by software
battery life is decent, my s21 ultra got 4 hours of ost so i sent it back, this one gets 6 hours while gaming nonestop and i think that for todays phones is decent and i doubt i can get higher than that at my usage, my mate 10 pro is still the master of battery to me, it did 9 hours of onscreen time with max brightness and the idle battery was incredible too, it's the benchmark for me when it comes to battery
&amp;#x200B;
here are the things i didn't like
camera this is where i am extremely dissapppointed, holding the phone perfectly still still produces images that aren't as sharp as i'd want even my mate 10 pro seems to beat these even older galaxy phones seems to do a better job, see example here  [taltigolt på Twitter: ""Taken with Samsung galaxy s22 ultra exynos what is happening https://t.co/sslDpTNgNe"" / Twitter](https://twitter.com/ZZCOOL/status/1495804926718533640)

performance, when i play mariokart tour it sometimes lags especially when videochatting at the same time, i feel it's overheating but i haven't checked this, if it is indeed overheating then it may go back
&amp;#x200B;
reception seems to be terrible unless something happened, i wen't outside my apartment expecting to have the full reception i get from my xz1 and i didn't even had internet it was not until i moved further from the apartment with my scooter that it started to come, i am not sure if it was just really slow to update but that reception was terrible if that was the case  
this review was conducted using a s22 ultra that i received around 3 weeks ago so it had time to calibrate the battery, it's the 512 gb 12 gb ram model exynos my usage is adaptive brightness off and max brightness as far as it can go, with the extra brightness boost setting, the game i played was mariokart tour."

Should I cancel my preorder for S22 Ultra?	"Seems to be a lot of delivery issues going on for the S22 phones. I ordered my S22 Ultra(256gb, burgundy, ATT) on the Feb 12th, the original expected delivery date was Feb 25th. Then it went to Mar 1 and now its Mar 4th. I don't really want to keep looking at the date change as I've seen some people get their orders pushed back to April.
Should I try my luck in a store on release day? I'm thinking I'll just cancel the preorder and see who's gonna have it in stock this friday. Anyone else considering this?"	N
Theming on S22?	Is Theme Park not ready for the 22 yet? It doesn't seem to want to theme anything. I'm stuck with odd green text bubbles and I'd rather use my own colors.	N
S22U reboots ?	"So I'll be getting my S22U this coming monday, but I've been reading some concerning stuff about it.
What is that reboot issue that people are having? Some even reporting that their phones are bricked?
I am coming from the Xperia 1 III that I love very much (though it does have some shortcomings) and I'm just wondering if I'm switching for a worse phone lol"	N
S22U Battery Actually Smaller Than Advertised?	"I received my S22U in the mail yesterday morning and one of the first things I did was download Accubattery. Based off the couple of charges I've done so far its showing battery capacity at 4,782 instead of 5,000 as advertised.
I've compared this to the Pixel 6 and a couple of other phones and they all have shown to charge to the capacity promised (or higher).
Has anyone else used Accubattery to see what they're actually getting? I realize this is still early and I'll need plenty more charges to nail down exactly but I'm curious of others results."	N
Received the S22+ in the mail today but my SIM card from my old phone doesn't work	Hi guys, I just received my S22+ today and everything was going good until I put the SIM card in... Keep getting error "SIM 1 not allowed". I don't know what to do and need help. Only thing I can think is that the SIM is from my S20 which is from Sprint with a T-Mobile sim in it. I bought the S22+ from Sprint's website and I didn't get any SIM so I used the T-Mobile SIM from the S20 in the S22+. Can someone help me please?	N
Whitestone Done S22U.	Anybody install the Whitestone Dome tempered glass screen protector on the S22 Ultra yet? I used a standard garbage TPU screen protector on my S21 Ultra, but I was considering a glass one for my S22 Ultra because I don't want to put grooves in a TPU one with the s-pen. Any loss in screen sensitivity or issues with the fingerprint scanner? Thanks.	N
Cannot feel S22 Ultra notification vibrations, nor can I hear it when it's sitting on the table in front of me.	"Hey guys, I received my s22 ultra today and been absolutely loving it. Practically every aspect had been awesome including battery life.
However. I noticed something.
The vibration feels absolutely great in hand, but it is EXTREMELY quiet ... when sat down on the table on in your pocket. I missed several notifications while the phone was in my pocket which is almost a dealbreaker. I don't want to be missing important texts and whatnot. I doubled checked the setting and I had the intensity all the way up.
Funny enough, MKBHD also released the review video today and mentioned the exact same thing I was thinking which can be seen in this [timestamp](https://youtu.be/vXIAB_1FEC0?t=352)
___
I did an experiment. I set an alarm off so it was in constant vibration.
Couldn't feel it in my khakis, gym shorts, shorts... only felt in my super tight jeans. Unless the phone is pressed up against you, you'll like miss it. It's unbelievably bad, I think there will be a flood of unhappy consumer once the mass finally start getting their hands on them.
I also sat it on the table and made it go off and I can barely even hear it while directly listening to it. 
Someone posted video of what it's like here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agF7YdXrrTc
----
What are your guys thoughts/experience with this?  
You think they can have software fix to increase intensity? ...
I'm not sure what to do and getting kinda worried. Don't know if I can have a phone where I can't feel in my pocket. I don't a watch as a hack alternative...
EDIT - should note I've tried various patterns and intensity is maxed."	N
Official samsung s22u cases	"Has anyone tried a smart view case? I'm coming from an s20  ultra whuch honestly with a shitty rubberized slim case has been able to withstand a ton of abuse. I threw my phone through one layer of a hollowcore door with just scratches. 
I abuse my phones, but tend to baby this one. I'm considering just getting a soft case like the one i had but the rounded edges make me nervous, and so does the camera stick out.
How protective are the smartview cases? Are they leather. Or.... aamsung cases overall? Opinions? Not expecting miracles in terms of a case like my s20u"	N
S22 Ultra is going back. Fold here I come	"So I'm not loving the S22 Ultra.  It's super heavy or at least it feels heavier than my old fold 2.  Must be down to it's width and weight distribution.
I have found a Fold 2 available for 450 usd and a Fold 3 for 600usd.  
I Loved my Fold 2, used it without a case from day 1, but did eventually manage to break it.  All my fault.  Insurance paid out but got the Ultra instead.  I'm debating on going back to the Fold as they are more fun and useful when reading in bed or for general media consumption.
What do you guys think about choosing either the Fold 2 or 3.  I use to use the selfie cam on the inside screen a lot to take pics with the kids.  The Fold 3 under screen camera looks like sh\*t, and i'm hearing the battery is bad.  
&amp;#x200B;
Love to hear your feedback and pointers to help me make a final decision.

Cheers"	N
[Question] What are the odds I'll get my s22u before April?	"Hello everyone!
This is my first time pre-ordering a Samsung phone.
I am slated to receive my phone in April. In the past, has Samsung  ever delivered the phones earlier than that?
Not in a rush (I know I ordered late), just curious.
Cheers!"	N
If I ordered a T-Mobile version of an S22 through Samsung will it come activated already?	"Was going to gift it to my sister but when I bought it through the Shop Samsung I checked the option to activate online to save $50. I'm just not sure if it comes activated with a SIM card or eSIM. The phone number that I chose to activate it though is my phone number and I'm currently using my S22U with it so I also wasn't sure if that'd cause any problems. I just wanted to know if she can just put her old SIM card in there and be good to go
To anyone that bought a T-Mobile S22 from Samsung did it come pretty activated or could you just swap the SIM card to it?"	N
S21 Ultra or S22 Plus?	"I am shopping for a new phone after my iPhone XR gave up. I was a happy S8+ user before the iPhone and now I want to get back to Android. I don't care for the S Pen and S21 Ultra design is SICK. I find it open box on eBay for 800 USD. I am NOT considering the s22 ultra however I do consider the s22 Plus. I have held both at Best Buy and they seem fine. The s22 Ultra is too edgy for me (and I live in Illinois, having to use 2 hands to handle a phone in winter is BRUTAL).
I understand that the s22 Plus has one more year of support. However, I am very attracted to the design of the S21 and I'd say that the cameras on the S21 are a bit more flexible.
I tried the Pixel 6 for two weeks: great software, I had no bugs, but the screen looked a bit crappy, not bright enough. So here I am looking into Samsung phones.
My use cases are fairly normal: messaging apps, plenty of email and browsing, quite a few photos, not so many videos. I don't game on my phone.
Since I am a Google Fi costumer, I can get the S22 Plus for 1000 + 550 in Google Fi credit. Since i don't plan on switching carriers soon, that would be getting S22 for 450...
What would you choose? S22 Plus for (essentially) 450 or s21 Ultra for 800?"	N
S22 ultra 256gb seeming only has 10gb ram?	"Got mine today and checked with cpuz and device info, they both report back with total ram at 10gb instead of 12gb, unsure if this is an isolated issue or if the information provided by Samsung and stores was wrong (at time of writing Verizon only has an 8gb and 12gb ram model listed, and the 8gb is only on the 128gb storage model)
Anyone else having the same issue?"	N
S22 Ultra 8k Recording?	"I believe the snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip is capable of 8k/60fps recording but the S22 ultra doesn't seem to have that. It also does not have 8k/30fps, why has 8k recording stagnated with the S21 Ultra at 8k/24fps? 
30fps should be the absolute minimum and it is a disappointment that Samsung hasn't raised the frame rate from 24 to that. I can understand the decision against 60fps due to size and heat but not even 30fps at 8k?"	N
Just got my S22 Ultra! What are some things I should do with it?	I just got my preorder today, switching over from a OnePlus 6T, and this is my first Samsung phone since I retired my S4. What are some Samsung/S-pen/One UI tweaks/tricks/etc I should know?	N
S22U First impressions	"I upgraded from a galaxy s10+ which was a really solid phone. I probably could have kept using that phone for several more years if I just replaced the battery but I felt it was time for something new.
I got my S22U in the mail today and it is so much bigger than I expected but it feels solid. I wasn't sure how I felt about the camera layout not having the support around it.. and I'm still not.
Really disappointed samsung didnt include extra nibbs for the stylus or a charger and is asking me to send in my old phone with its charger &amp; adapter.
Only thing besides that is the speakers seem quieter and the vibrator seems softer than my s10+"	N
Temporary Cases for S22U	I've got a Speck Presidio 2 Grip on order but they have yet to tell me when it's shipping. The older version Presidio Grip is what I bought to replace a worn out Otterbox Symmetry on my outgoing S9 and it's been great (took a year and half with a few drops before showing any signs of wear) With my phone delivery expected tomorrow, any recommendations for something I would stand a chance of actually picking up that could get me by till it arrives? Or am I delusional for thinking I'll even find anything locally or that can ship asap?	N
S20FE to S22 upgrade?	"I got the S20 FE on the 50% buyback program from Samsung back when they used to do that. I can pull that trigger at any point from now until June. I get $350 when I send the phone back.
The promo on the S22 trade in is only $300 so the buyback is the best deal money wise.
Is there a decent improvement between these phones? I gravitate towards the normal S22 for the smaller size and it's slightly cheaper coming in at $21/month including Samsung Care. The S22+ seems like it might be a tad large as the S20 FE is about my limit. I'm big on one-handed use and having it fit in a front pocket.
My choices are either pull the trigger now and get the S22 or wait closer to June where I don't have remaining payments to make on the S20 FE to zero that one out. Seems the promos now on S22 are more about trade in than price of the phone. But I doubt that will change in 90 days.
If June passes and I don't do the buyback on the S20FE then I am on the hook for the rest of the remaining phone value or I take whatever low value Samsung will give me in the future which will quite a bit less than what I can get now."	N
Epic fail by Samsung on S22 shipment.	"For whatever reason, Samsung told FedEx to hold my  the order containing my new unlocked white S22 256gb phone with Galaxy Buds2 for an extra day in Dallas to so that it would be delivered no sooner than 2/23. However, due to an ""unforeseen local delay"" by FedEx in Atlanta very early this morning, the delivery of my order has been delayed to a date to be determined.
This likely could have been avoided by Samsung allowing FedEx to deliver my order as quickly as they had intended on doing so to begin with!"	N
S22 ultra first impressions	"Camera is great
software is great
battery life is ok, and I'm at 60hz and 720 screen res

Bixby consumes battery even when I'm not using it"	N
Please see the Question I posted on r/S22Ultra		N

Anybody using the RAM Plus Feature in device care?	I saw that my S22 ultra has a Ram Plus feature and its set to 4GB and im wondering if its better to turn it up to 6 or 8gb? what are the benefits and if any the downsides?	N
Unlocked S22 Ultra not allowed to install Verizon apps?	"I usually use TrueCaller and Verizon's spam app (Call Filter) to keep out unwanted calls throughout the day. When I try to install Verizon's Call Filter app, it just sits there on ""Checking account status.....please wait."" I've tried clearing cache on it but it doesn't change anything. Does anyone else have this problem? 
Using Verizon Sim card and old phone was Note 10+ Verizon version."	N
Zoom is ridiculous	"Its cold and snowy here so I haven't had a lot of time to play with the camera. But holy heck, has the zoom improved from the S20 ultra and the note 20 ultra.

S Pen issue?	Having owned every Note since day one, this is the first time I notice that when pulling the S Pen out, it doesn't come out as smooth as on previous phones. Was this done in purpose?	N
eSIM + S22 on AT&amp;T Prepaid?	"Been back and forth with Customer Service at AT&T (chat and phone) as well as gone to the corporate AT&T store, and nobody is able to get my S22 eSIM set up, although everyone also say it should be possible. 
At the store, they said I need a physical paper with a QR code (which seems idiotic, since I could just scan it off a screen) but that they don't have any in stock?! Insane. 
And on the phone, they said only Apple devices are available in the drop-down on their screens, so they can't activate it, even though the EID and IMEI are provided. 
Anyone in the US had any luck with eSIM and AT&T Prepaid? I need it for dual SIM capability."	N
My Phone Was Stolen	This is what I got today. My phone was stolen. Lol. That black styrofoam block was supposed to be my Phone.	N
Is it red or orange? (Samsung exclusive colors)	"Why does the Red color appear orange on the Samsung exclusive colors page? 
I want the deep vibrant red."	N
Has anyone had any luck backing up the Samsung Keyboard data?	I wanted to back up the Samsung Keyboard data like Samsung used to so I can put it in to the S22 if possible (where it saves all of your words you've put in). Samsung used to do this automatically via the cloud but stopped for whatever reason.	N
Trade In Thread	"Anyone else send in their trade ins yet? Figured I'd start a new thread for tracking the status/approval.  
I sent out both my S21 ultra and my S7+ Tablet this morning."	N
Where is the "5G" icon on my phone screen?	I received my new S22 Ultra phone today and went to a local Verizon store to have them install a brand new 5G SIM card into the new phone. A few minutes later the phone worked perfectly and I saw the 5G symbol at top right of the screen. But a short time later it showed 4G instead. I did a soft reset of the phone and it still only shows 4G. What happened to the 5G signal? I had it initially when the phone was first activated. I'm near downtown San Francisco, a major metropolitan area that should have 5G signal. Any solution?	N
Post your Battery Life and SOT	So far so good outstanding battery life have my extra brightness on have 120hz and WQHD all enabled	N
Screen Shots	"Anyone know where the screen shots button Is?
I'm use to it being in side edge."	N
Charging questions and Protect Battery option in device care S22 Ultra	"So is it true its best to charge to 85% max to get the best out of the battery? I see an option to protect battery and wondering what do you guys think of this? Do you use it? For me i dont think 85% battery is enough to get me through the day. 
Is it best for the battery to go down to 30% for better battery life and charge it up from there? I heard letting the battery go below 30% is not good for it?  
Is it bad to charge your phone before u sleep and leave it plugged in until you wake up? 
Does making the font size and screen zoom bigger than default consume more battery?"	N
Samsung Health	In my Note9 I could measure blood oxygen in Samsung Health app. Is there any way to do it in my s22 Ultra?	N
For us former Note 20 users. How does the S22U feel?	"I had the S21 Ultra and the Note 20 Ultra before this. TBH this reminds me of the Note 20 Ultra A LOT. except being a bit faster and better camera. Honestly, other than that I don't see a HUGE upgrade from my memory of owning a Note 20 Ultra. 
Still like it much better than S21 Ultra because the pen has bluetooth and all."	N

Bloatware removal for S22	"Hello everyone,
I received my S22 ultra yesterday (loving it) and thought I'd share this with you all.

Samsung credit on S22 and S22+ increases by $50 when trying to pre-order from iPhone!!	"&amp;#x200B;
https://preview.redd.it/mz0bfd21pqj81.jpg?width=576&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e57e50835d9061709b102dc9a0ef7e0359af0a66
As you can see the Samsung credit offered for both model increases by $50 when checked on iPhone. I placed my order from a windows machine and all I can get is regular $100 credit. I checked on mac safari, but there it is regular $100. Thought someone might find it useful.
This reminds me of airlines charging more if booking is done from a mac/iPhone!"	N
s22+ LED cover		N
Screen brightness	I know I'm going to feel dumb. But I've noticed on all the videos I've seen of the S22U. I see them adjusting the screen brightness slider and it's on the bottom. Mine is still on top. How is this being done?	N
Any comparisons yet between Spigen Tough Armor, Encased Rebel, and Torras Guardian for base S22?	"Been using a Otterbox Defender w/o a screen protector for the past 3 years on my S10+ without any issues I really don't find it all that ""bulky"" as a lot of people say, other then the price. I have dropped the phone occasionally during that time but never anything major, no scratches, tho case itself has seen better days. I do like the idea of a more thinner case per say but I use for work and it's in my hand for most of the day so def need something with a good grip.
Seeing as I got the S22 for free and money is a lil tight at the moment but I want it covered asap, I'm looking at some of the more budget friendly options as mentioned. Never used any but after browsing the subs for a couple hours those were the three I ended with all around $15-20 .. other then the middle ground $40 dbrand, latercase, peak design, and maybe one or two others in that range I forgot to write down.
Sorry in advanced for another case post but any input is appreciated!
edit: I should also add the Encased Falcon .. looks like it's the one step up model to the Rebel with extra hard shell/frame underneath I believe"	N
Best Buy orders	"Anyone who pre-ordered from Best Buy and had an April 1st date get an email saying it will be ready tomorrow? 
I pre-ordered on February 9th at like 4pm and it said pickup on the 25th.  The next day i got an email saying April 1st.  When i called BB they said they see in their system for release date and i should get an email today (the 24th) saying it will be ready on the 25th.  Just being impatient but i wonder if anyone has already gotten one of these emails?"	N

Battery learning patterns	"A lot of people mention this ""The phone is still learning your usage patterns"" when someone complains about the battery being terrible.
Does anyone have any facts about this, because my theory is, that what the phone is really doing is learning your patterns so it can ""accurately"" predict how much time you've got left and that's all. Also, is this even a thing on any other brands as well?"	N

I am a university student which mainly uses the phone for photos, music and texting and occasional gaming. If so, should I go for the 256gb model? Is the pink gold worth getting - seems a bit pale has anyone gotten their hands on it? And lastly samsung care! Is it worth getting samsung care?

S22 ultra in red shipping ???	"I pre-ordered the s22 Ultra 1TB in red. Boy, was it a hassle to even get it. I was feeling some buyers remorse and was going to order the 512GB version instead. When I went to cancel my original order it was denied with the following email:
We were unable to cancel all or part of the requested items below for your order xxxxx because it has already left our shipping facility. If you still do not want the item, you may either refuse the shipment when it arrives or you can return your item later.
Is my phone already on its way? It had a arrival date of April 8. If so screw buyers remorse I can't wait. 🥲🤣"	N
The S22+ will be my first smartphone that's not just whatever my carrier offered for free. How do I make the most of a phone at this level?	"To give you an idea of where I'm coming from: even being able to use Spotify in the background without my phone freezing when I open the browser or Google docs is going to be a novelty for me.  The other day my wife asked me to look up directions before we left the house... Five minutes into our drive I had to use her iPhone instead, because Maps was still loading on mine.
Now that I finally get to experience what I'm sure most people think of as basic smartphone functionality - and then some - what should I be sure not to miss out on? Are there any life-improving tricks/apps that are popular with Samsung fans, but maybe not obvious to carrier-brand yokels like me? I've already made a note of a couple of Bixby routines."	N

Returning trade-in device via FedEx - where to drop it off?	"I'm seeing multiple options near me - Walgreen's OnSite, OfficeMax ShipSite, FedEx Office, and a bit farther away is a FedEx Authorized ShipCenter.

I get that its... preference? and very subjective. and we all have different hand sizes. but i'd like to know everyone's thoughts :P Also... how about the weight? like how about single hand scrolling or web browsing? is the weight too heavy? how about weight balance? will the phone keep tilting because of the weight?

Switching from iPhone 12 Pro to S22+	"The titles pretty self explanatory but I’m going back to Samsung after having an iPhone for the last 3.5 years and I’m a bit scared I’ll be making the wrong choice? My siblings and all my close friends all have iPhones so I’ll miss imessage the most. But I do miss the customization with android. For having the iPhone 12 Pro, my battery sucks badly. I charged my phone to full before bed and woke up to it with 50% 🙃 
My S22+ is being delivered tomorrow and I was just wondering if there’s any tips and tricks that can be recommended? I’m somewhat familiar with Samsung but since it’s been so long, I can’t exactly remember &amp; for those coming from iPhones, how do you feel about the S22 line?"	N
Mostly a farewell post, since I upgraded to my S22 Ultra two days ago and I love it! I also loved my S21 Ultra, though (fond memories!), but the storage is what got me. I simply can't use 128GB anymore, otherwise I'd keep it for another year. Hope everyone that's keeping theirs enjoys another year!		N

Note 20 Ultra to S22 Ultra - is the trade-in worth it?	So, I have a Note 20 Ultra (as well as a Fold 3, which I'm currently using for everything except pokemon go). I was looking at the S22 Ultra since Samsung is giving pre-order deals, such as larger HDD space for cheaper and limited edition color choices, but upon looking at the stats, if I'm not mistaken, the S22 Ultra is a downgrade from the Note 20 Ultra, right? It has less ram, it's a tiny bit smaller, and it seems like the only things it has on the Note 20 Ultra is 500 mah + in battery size, and a better front-facing camera. Am I mistaken? Samsung has also gotten rid of external storage on the newer models, which I'm not thrilled about, but can live with. My concerns about keeping the Note 20 Ultra were that I had read that it will only receive one or a few more OS updates (is this true?), and that its value will dimension, which was the primary reason I was thinking of upgrading in the first place. What's everyone else's take on the S22 Ultra? Are there other stats I am missing that make the S22 Ultra superior to the Note 20 Ultra? Do you think I should take advantage of the 600 off / pre-order perks and trade-in now?	N
f3 -&gt; s22u -&gt; f3; thoughts after one day of using s22u	"once you go fold, everything else is ooooooollddddd!! and if i gotta 2-hand a phone, it gotta be bigger than the s22u.
the only +s i have to say about s22u is that it has better cameras and that it's a big glass display. that's it. better cameras on paper, but it still pretty bad with moving subjects.
some pain points of s22u, coming from someone who's last samsung phone was the note 5:
- fingerprint sucks, dry finger ~7/10, slight damp finger ~2/10; ive trained the same finger 3 times and i made sure to angle my thumb how i would usually hold the phone. fold3, 9.5/10.
- curve screen warps what's on display, impossible to get glass screen protector.
- it's top heavy. i found it difficult to one hand.
- s-pen is pointless. it's tiny. writing on glass is too slippery.
- s-pen/its slot has texture, so it doesnt 'glide' in, if u put it back in a slight angle, it'll get caught
- battery life is meh
- media, while it doesnt have top/bottom black bars, it has side black bars 
- speakers seems ~same as f3
- the curve of s22u body makes it very slippery and hard to hold without case; using a basic clear case made it grippier to hold
s22u software:
- weirdly, s22u loads some apps i use slower than f3???
- i find overall reaction speed of f3 faster than s22u, both observed while battery is ~65% and no real activity prior to using
- sometimes, loading apps like reddit sync/google photos, i get a black screen, and i would need to restart the app completely????
s22u is not a bad phone obviously. but def not a worthy trade from f3"	N
All of you need to chill with the S22U	You hate the fold and wish you didn't have it? Sure switch, got the fold on one of those almost free mobile carrier deals and wanna keep credit you can do that but if you're not in one of these groups and can wait more than a year for a new phone wait for ZF4 like actually so many posts about this	N
I'm thinking of canceling my S22 Ultra pre-order.	"As the title states, I was going to get a S22 Ultra as sort of a bridge until I can see what the Fold 4 has to offer.
I was originally a Note guy until I thought the line was dead. I grabbed a Fold 3 as I thought that was the replacement. When I saw a S22U had the S-Pen I ran to try to get one. Last night I was watching YouTube on my Fold and I don't know if I can give this thing up."	N
FirstNet S22 unlocked users you need U firmware	"Another year another U1 optics.img not including FirstNet for AT&amp;T. Calls will make the phone drop to HSPA.
Save yourself a ton of trouble. Download any carriers U firmware, ATT is usually impossible to fund. TMB/DSH will work fine. Flash it, you can even use the HOME_CSC so you don't need to factory reset. When you see the AT&amp;T boot up screen you are set. VoLTE, WiFi calling and VVM will work. Enjoy your S22 unlocked on FirstNet and don't forget to debloat."	N
S22 payoff question	So I just bought an s22 through att on an installment plan but how does it work exactly? Im trading in a pixel 3 for the $800 In bill credits but I now am reading that's over 3 years, so do I have to keep this phone for 3 years? I can't pay off the remaining balance for instance next year Incase I want a new phone?	N
Galaxy S22 ultra 5G Band on AT&amp;T	"So at&amp;t hasnt enabled N14, N30 on this device S22 ultra or i dont know if this device supports it? I am using Unlocked U1 version.

Free Galaxy S22 with ANY Galaxy?	"I’m looking to upgrade a phone on one of my lines. I want to take advantage of the free upgrade with any Galaxy phone. 
I have a Sprint Galaxy S II. Will I really get the $800 credit for this? The offer ends soon and their chat support hasn’t been very helpful."	N
My S22 did not come with a SIM card or any T-Mobile information in the package.	Exactly what the title says.. Just received my S22 but it came with absolutely nothing except the S22. No paperwork, no SIM card, nothing else.. When I start up the phone it then asks me to insert a SIM card to continue. (Though I was able to bypass it by holding the power down button)..	N
new s22u unlocked, from sprint s9	"guessing my easiest/best option is to head to the corp store, get some sim cards, and have the phones activated ?? (one s22u here, still no tracking on the other, both were scheduled for 2/25) I think we have some sims we were sent long ago branded as T-Mobile, the store is like 10-15 minutes away.
any drawbacks or other options, ??  Debating if we should have gone branded, might hop to spectrum mobile, or jump on a T-Mobile 55+ plan. that's my thoughts anyways. 
then i get to see if wifi calling, rcs, 5g and other things work. use to follow xda quite a bit, been a number of years. guess i need to get to reading again. 
thanks much for your time."	N
Will T-Mobile have S22 Ultras in stores on the 25th despite pre-orders being backordered?	Thinking of getting a green if they have it in stock and cancelling the red I pre-ordered through Samsung.	N
Galaxy S22 Ultra Google Messages Chat (RCS) not working?	"Does anyone else that has a Galaxy S22 and using Google Messages for sms/RCS having issues getting RCS chat working with any contacts that it worked with previously?
My settings state chat features are working for my number.  I've disabled and re-enabled multiple times, and started new chats and it just sends SMS and MMS only.  It isn't just my phone either my wife's S22 Ultra is also working the same way.  Does RCS not work on 5G?"	N
S22 ultra first impressions (snapdragon version)	"Mine came this afternoon. FedEx guy needed a signature and everything. He would have left had I not been there which I just so happened to be home, got lucky.
Everything arrived (s22 ultra snap dragon version, leather case, keyboard case for tab 8 ultra) except for the tab 8 ultra which still hasn't shipped.
Phone is stunning and sleek. Beautiful design. Transferring all my info from the z fold 3 to the s22 ultra has gotten faster from when I did it from my s21 ultra to the fold 3.
The crypto.com app was the only third party app that kept giving me crash issues. Had to Uninstall and install again, works fine now.
This phone is still on the January 1st security update. The fold 3 has already received the Feb 1st patch so I'm looking forward to this phone getting it. 
Out of the box it's everything I expected, fast. 
Coming from the fold 3 I honestly think the next fold device would be perfect if the front screen was the same size as this phone's screen size. Having this form factor to then be able to unfold it for double the screen size will make the next fold devices unstoppable. 
I'm not going to lie, I'm going to miss my fold 3. I won't miss the knit picks I have about the fold 3 though (small front screen, lack luster camera, crease etc) but I'm going to miss being able to open it up for a larger screen from anywhere. That's why I got the tab s8 ultra though. 
The form factor of this phone is definitely setup better for apps. UI software for third party apps is still lagging behind for fold 3 optimization. 
Been using this phone for the last few hours non stop and haven't noticed any over heating issues. There are some hiccups here and there with third party apps but I can tell that will be easily fixed with the next security patch. 
The smart switch experience with going from the old device to the new one is getting crazy good. All my data and info was transferred over, wifi passwords, email logins. I had to manually put in reddit but that's no biggie. Bluetooth works flawlessly between both devices. Before I would always have to repair everything on the newer device.
I one thing I did notice is that I always have to manually change over to textra and SwiftKey. I obvious Samsung wants everyone to use their message app and their keyboard, which are trash imo compared to SwiftKey and textra. Just my preference, but Samsung is definitely not making it easy to use third party messaging and text. 
Still, Definitely digging this phone. The speakers are definitely louder (turn on Dolby atmos) than my fold 3 and s21 ultra. Love the look (green 512gig with black leather case), it looks classy and professional. 
Job well done again, Samsung. 
Let me know if you have any questions
Edit:  the vibration haptic motor is fine. Not sure why people are saying they can't feel it if it's in their pockets. I have it on normal what ever it came as and I haven't had any issues.  I wear normal form fitting clothes. Maybe baggy clothes are the issue."	N

S22U: X axis vibration motor feels more premium	"Is it just me or does the X axis vibration motor actually feel more premium than the Z axis one in past phones? Like I see why Apple uses X axis. It feels more premium for the haptic feedback like when typing or pressing a toggle. 
Yes, it makes a weaker sound when getting a call or notification, but you can just turn on the sound and put it really low if you were trying to hear vibration for calls...
Overall, I'd say the s22u's x axis vibration motor feels premium and is awesome. What are y'alls thoughts?"	N

Having trouble choosing S22+ or S22 Ultra... S10 512gb user here... Thoughts?	"Seeing that the promo is done tomorrow, wondering if anyone can chime in getting the S22+ or S22Ultra for $300 more..I would pay $750 cad or so for the S22 plus and about 1100 for the S22 Ultra all before taxes. this is after $100 code, workplace discounts and trade in S10. 
I really would love 512gb and 1440p screen but the size of Ultra kinda bugs me, not sure I get used to it after regular S10. the regular S22 feels a bit small and the small battery is a big bummer to me. 
I like the S22 + being a good compromise with bigger battery and screen though still only on 256gb which sucks coz on S10, i have 512gb and a sd card..its a downgrade for now...anyway thoughts? my s10 battery is killing me!!!"	N

Problem with picking up S22 Ultra at FedEx after delivery attempt	"I ordered an S22 Ultra on Feb 12; Fedex made an attempt to deliver this morning while I was at work, which was expected.

So I get out of work and drive 30min out of my way to the location just to be told they won't give me the package due to shippers instructions of it to not be released until the 24th. So I'm confused. 
If the shipment wasn't supposed to be received until tomorrow, why did they try and deliver today? Why would they tell me I can pick up at the FedEx location?

Thanks for any suggestions.

Ideal Screen Setting for S22 Ultra	Hi guys what is the ideal screen setting for S22 ultra? And what you are currently using? Choices are HD+, FHD+, WQHD+?	N
S22 Ultra Battery life	I got 6 Hours and 9mins of screen on time with mostly 90% brightness. That's also with watching about 1 hour and 30 mins of video with the brightness at 100%. With the S21 ultra I got usually 6 to 6 and half. So the battery life is pretty much the same as that if not just a bit Worse. In my opinion anything over 5 hours and 30 mins I consider good battery life. With the new 45W Charger you can charge your phone for 30 mins and get about 70% so that's big positive.	N

However, my parents also ordered new S22's and they want cases that have "some extra grip on the side".

Note 20 Ultra vs S22 Ultra - pros/cons to upgrading	So, I have a Note 20 Ultra (as well as a Fold 3, which I'm currently using for everything except pokemon go). I was looking at the S22 Ultra since Samsung is giving pre-order deals, such as larger HDD space for cheaper and limited edition color choices, but upon looking at the stats, if I'm not mistaken, the S22 Ultra is a downgrade from the Note 20 Ultra, right? It has less ram, it's a tiny bit smaller, and it seems like the only things it has on the Note 20 Ultra is 500 mah + in battery size, and a better front-facing camera. Am I mistaken? Samsung has also gotten rid of external storage on the newer models, which I'm not thrilled about, but can live with. My concerns about keeping the Note 20 Ultra were that I had read that it will only receive one or a few more OS updates (is this true?), and that its value will dimension, which was the primary reason I was thinking of upgrading in the first place. What's everyone else's take on the S22 Ultra? Are there other stats I am missing that make the S22 Ultra superior to the Note 20 Ultra? Do you think I should take advantage of the 600 off / pre-order perks and trade-in now?	N
S22 Plus screen faded to black and stayed black until force restart?	I was setting up my new S22 plus. Not sure if this is related but was trying to log in to Snapchat. After like my fifth failed Snapchat login attempt, the phone's screen faded to black and didn't come back on. The phone was still responding as if the screen were showing things, vibrating when I pulled up to go home or held the power button. Had to hold power + volume down for about a minute to force a restart. Not sure what happened here but scared the crap out of me. After restart the screen works fine again. I'll update if anything else happens. Anyone else run into this? S22+, not Ultra.	N

S22 Ultra Cases Hard To Remove	"I received 4 different cases using the free $200 credit.
I put on the official leather one (no flap, just a standard case with leather material), and liked it well enough...but when I wanted to remove it, I had extreme difficulty.
Like I was so afraid I was going to crack or bend the phone trying the peel off the case around the corners.
And I didn't want to ""punch out"" of the case by pushing on one of the camera lenses (obviously).
I was finally able to get it out without damage (that I can tell).
I now have it in the S-Flip cover case, but I'm scared to try and take it out.
Any tips on this? Thank you."	N

Questions about 45W Charger	"So i heard you need to use the cable that comes with the samsung 45w charger and not the one that comes in the box of the s22 ultra because the cable in the box is thinner so you wont get full 45w charging? Is this true?  
Is it best to use the 45w charger with the s22 ultra? 
Are you getting a 45w charger with your s22 ultra or using your old 25w charger? 
Phone Arena Quote:
If you plan on getting a 45W charger, you should know that it comes with a thicker cable in the package, and only with that cable you get the full 45W speeds, so avoid pairing the 45W charger with the thinner cable in the box (it will work, you just won't get the full 45W charging speeds)."	N

Call & text on other devices	So with Google messages being difficult I was afraid that the call & texting feature on tablets would be disabled. Checked the phone settings and see that I was right.

So much disappointment (S22 Ultra, US T-mobile)	"I love the Samsung family. I had the switched from iPhone & got the Galaxy S4 the day it came out & never looked back. My next phone was the 6, then 8 plus (didn't last long due to drops) then Note 9 which is still by far my favorite phone. 
Some complains:
Missing the LED blinking light at top for notifications? IMO this is what stood out the most vs an iPhone. I had no way of knowing if I got a notification without waking up my phone unless I want to drain the battery even more (don't get me started with that) and keeping the display on.  
Well speaking of battery life. It's brutal. Two nights in a row I went to bed at 100% & averaged 6 hours of sleep. Woke up both days with my phone at 91% 
The phone can't lay flat??? What the heck???? I can't use the pen right without the phone wobbling all over the place. Whoever designed the back needs to be resign. 
And my pants fall down everytime I put it in my pocket it's stupid heavy.  
I also miss the headphone jack but I knew that going in & is also why I still love my note 9 more.  
And lastly - I miss the volume buttons being on the left. I never swiped my hand before to take a screen shot.  
Some pros though -  
Screen is beautiful. Watching movies & such on the phone should be enjoyable.  
Camera is by far one of the best coming from a photographer. I hope it holds up well at confers too.  
It's fast lol but it's also new so...  
Anyways that is my little rant. Even thinking about actually switching to my note 9 again since I kept it. I'm going to give it at least 1 week though before doing anything but like I said I'm just disappointed in some of the small features missing that I think could have easily stayed."	N
S22 Ultra with Exynos has performance & display issues	This does not bode well for all those users in Europe who will be receiving their Exynos S22 Ultra devices from Samsung on their official launch day, today, 25th February... The retail Galaxy S22 Ultra with Exynos has performance and display issues "the only thing I can say is to hold off on purchasing the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra for now if you live in Europe, because as it stands right now, the Exynos 2200 Galaxy S22 Ultra is completely unusable as a daily driver. It’s incredibly laggy and the battery life is terrible, too. This isn’t even the first day, it’s the second, and even “calibration” shouldn’t cause it to only have 50 minutes of SOT with 67% left." (Source... Adam Conway, Senior editor at XDA-Developers) I have a feeling that the new mantra for the Exynos S22 Ultra devices will be... "Hopefully there will be an update to fix this soon" If Samsung are able to release an update to fix these and other issues, they need to do it quickly before their returns date ends.	N
Improved Signal	"Has anyone else noticed that that the signal is better on the s22 than it is on the previous Samsung phones when you are in a low signal area? 
I usually have to use my AT&t hotspot at work because I didn't even have a signal in my office because it's so horrible with verizon. Today I was able to use my phone without the hotspot and go anywhere in the building and keep a signal it wasn't a strong signal but it was a signal and I was still able to use my phone. 
I know I saw an article somewhere that talked about they found a way to improve the low signal quality but I didn't think it would actually work."	N
Will the Ultra S22 phone have better cell signal VS my Note 10+ via Verizon service?	I have Verizon as my cellular carrier. The one thing that irks the cr@p outta me is having spotty cell signal service in various spots in San Francisco. The worst is having barely 1 bar of signal strength inside my condo unit of a high rise building in the busy downtown area of San Francisco. Even when I'm inside a certain restaurant, I will have almost no signal. I have zero signal inside the elevator in my condo, which is probably to be expected. The only saving grace for me is that my Note 10+ has wifi calling, so I simply connect my Note 10+ phone to my home wifi router and that's the only way I can have reliable cell connection for phone calls, etc. Otherwise without home wifi, my Note 10+ phone has terrible signal inside my condo unit. I have complained to Verizon in person about this issue, and even tried swapping out a new SIM card, but nothing helped. My question is whether the new Ultra 22 with its 5G signal will have better cell connection while I'm inside my high rise condo unit. I realize this question is based on speculation and nothing is certain until I receive my new Ultra 22 phone. Just wondering if anyone has also experienced this problem and hopefully the new Ultra 22 phone with its 5G signal will be the solution?	N

S22U vs IPhone 13 PRO Max. User prospective	"Writing this to help someone out there decide. 
Disclaimer: benchmarking for me are a tool when over clocking my PC’s GPU/CPU and never used them on my phones.
1- camera
The Galaxy takes a better still images and has better dynamic range (specially with sky and shadows)
iPhone is better in videos 
2- battery 
Have the Exynos one and the battery has been great tbh, getting around 6 to 8 sot in 24 hours 
The iPhone has far better standby management. For example: charging both to 100 &gt; sleep 8 hours &gt; iPhone is still 100 while the Galaxy is between 92-90 (same apps on both)
3- The Galaxy is more fun to use, and has a better balance in the hand.
4- Accessories: 
-AirPods 3 are just too good / better than the Galaxy ones (buds pro and live) 
-have the watch 3 and apple series 7 is much smoother. Watch 3 has a better auto detect (sleep and training).  Don’t know about watch 4
5- trust factor 😅
If I’m going for a trip so I’m taking the iPhone with me, not because it’s better (Galaxy is imo) but I trust it more as a companion device :)"	N

S20 vs S22: an ergonomic improvement	"The wider screen on the new S22 seems like such an ergonomic step up. I decided to put a pop socket on the upper part of the bottom half and it made holding the phone comfortable, which didn't seem to help on the S20; the length of the phone still made using it with one hand somewhat awkward. However, the increased x axis real estate feels like it allows my hand to be less cramped, which makes texting feel more natural. I'm sure the pop socket helps a lot, but it's very noticeable to me that I just enjoy this wider screen much more. I imagine this might be a similar change from the s21. The older galaxies seem to have a wider screen and I did, in the past, feel like the long and narrow aspect ratios just weren't as nice. 
One thing that I'm adjusting to is that the screen resolution drop isn't as unnoticeable as expected. I can tell the resolution is a bit of a step down, but I'm not sure it makes me like the phone any less. Overall just I like holding this phone a lot.
For clarity, upgrading was a bit of a stretch just because the S20 has been an absolutely amazing phone. Unfortunately it suffered a number of cracks despite having a case on it. I put a small crack in the camera cover glass the day I got it, if you can believe it. But that brings me to another point:
The flat screen is a feature I'm thrilled to have: maybe I can keep a dang glass screen protector on it now, and can actually protect my screen! I struggled with the curved edges on the S20, I just couldn't find a protector with an installation tray good enough to apply one correctly, so that it would stay on those curves.
Eventually I put a small crack in the corner of the screen of the S20, too. So trading it in with Samsung just seemed like the logical choice this year. I was disappointed to give up the SD card and high res screen, but with 256 on board I am not concerned anymore. 
Samsung pre-order shipping experience was an embarassment, though. Artificial delays on the package put me in a position to expect the phone to arrive for three days in a row, each day, which was a huge waste of time."	N

Cat Controls on S22?	" Just got my S22 Plus and I'm loving it. I did a smart switch from an S10 that has Android 11 on it. I've been working on setting up the phone and I noticed that under ""Device Control"" -&gt; ""Manage Apps"" the option to turn on ""Cat Controls"" is there. Do other people have this option? I chatted with Samsung and they said this is now standard. Or did something transfer to my new phone from the old one? I don't even remember having cat controls on my S10. Anyone else have this option??

So, I don't think it's wrong to expect a longer battery standby time. And she goes to office daily, and she says it's off by afternoon some time, and she charges sufficiently before leaving. 
So, the s22+, using trade-in seems like a good one, but I've heard the chip draws a lot more power now and they've reduced the battery size, so that's a bit concerning. I need more insights on it and those who have the s22+ can share their experiences here."	N
Best Buy Update	"I know there have been a lot of questions surrounding Best Buy orders (patience is not my strong suit).  I figured I'd share my recent experience because I think it may answer a lot of questions. 
I have the order status of: ""we'll let you know as soon as it's ready for pickup"" 256 GB Ultra Green
I stopped by the Best Buy to see if they had any idea of when I might actually get my phone. It came down to ""carrier or unlocked?"" The employee told me carrier phones would be picked up Friday, Saturday or Sunday. Unlocked phones ""not clear when they will have them"". 
Not sure if this will apply for all Best Buy's just wanted to share the news I got so people could have better expectations."	N

Did I buy the right charger (25w vs 45w) for base S22	I don't need fast charging. But I'm pretty sure even the 25w is considered "fast." Verizon has a sale right now on most Samsung accessories so I bought the 25w charging block for my base S22. My understanding is that 45w doesn't work with the base model. Regardless, I never need "fast charging." Should I get an even lower wattage charger if it might help my battery age more gracefully? I keep my phones a long time.	N

Battery health in the long run	I'm curious on what all of you do in order to prevent battery degradation over the course of a few years. I plan on keeping this phone for 4 years, and was wondering how I could best protect my battery. I have heard tips such as turning on the protect battery feature which limits the maximum charge to 85% and turning off fast charging. What do you think? I also remember hearing a few years back that Samsung promises 95% battery retention after 2 years starting on the S8. What do you think of that?	N
Samsung Galaxy S22 - "Real Review" - YouTube		N
Got my S22U 3 days ago &amp; I'm too afraid to use it lmao	"It arrived early on Tuesday, wasn't supposed to come til tomorrow. My screen/camera protectors came in the mail yesterday, but the screen protector was crap and both camera covers broke as soon as I put them on. Additionally, the phone screen sticks out of the case I bought, which makes me nervous about setting it face down.
I have a new UV gel screen protector and some camera covers arriving tomorrow. As for the case, I'll just have to wait until I get my Samsung credit and buy a legit one from them unless anyone has a recommendation for a better one!
Just think it's kinda funny that I've been waiting for &amp; talking about getting a Galaxy for about two years...now I *finally* have one, and it's just sitting on my desk. Literally haven't even turned it on yet because I'm too worried about dropping or damaging it. To be fair, it is HUGE for my tiny hands and I am a very clumsy individual; my anxiety doesn't come from nowhere.
Maybe someone who has opened theirs can tell me to relax and get it fired up already 😆"	N

Using The RAM Plus Feature on S22	"So I know that the RAM plus feature allows you to allocate storage memory on the phone to virtual RAM. My question is, would there be an advantage to increasing this to the max 8GB even though the ultra comes with 12GB RAM??
Would it be really necessary to get more RAM? I mean, I'd see this being useful if you have tons of RAM hungry apps running but usually Android does a decent job of managing your phone's RAM.
Any thoughts??"	N

Delivery date delayed AGAIN	So on Feb 13th around 8am I pre-ordered the s22 Ultra 256gb in burgundy (at&amp;t variant) and until a few days ago the delivery date was Feb 25th, but then out of nowhere with no warning the delivery date on the order tracker switched to March 4th. Now today I get an email saying they're going to "try" to get it to me by March 25th 😒.

Which screen protector did you buy and is the fingerprint feature working well with it?
Thanks!"	N
Is the S22 carrier specific	It's been quite a while since I looked into this and I'm having trouble finding the answer. Phones used to be carrier specific even if unlocked. I.E. you couldn't use your Verizon phone on TMobile and vice versa. I have put in a preorder for a S22 ultra from Google Fi which uses sprint and T-Mobile. Will this phone have Verizon or AT&amp;T bands as well if I decide to switch?	N
Is there a standardised way of measuring battery life rather than SOT?	"All these conflicting battery life SOT numbers making me wonder if it is a reliable form of measuring battery life capacity.

Battery strategy for ultra?	"Enjoying my green S22 Ultra so far and want to get its battery off to a good start / have better charging habits than I did for my last phone.   Is there value to deep cycling at first (full charge down to empty)?  
And in general, similar to my macbook, with slow charging to 80% then down to a low amount before recharging?  Am I over thinking?  I even have the 45W charger but figure I'll only use it when I actually need a quick charge. 
Oh and I did set a Bixby routine to prevent fast and super fast charging over night... any other useful routines I should put in place?  Can (and should) you force charging to stop at 80% for example?"	N

Galaxy Watch 4 &amp; Galaxy S22+	I love my new S22+. I set it up last night and linked it with my watch. The only thing that stinks about this setup process is that you have to factory reset your watch to pair it with the new phone. I was able to backup most things, but had to redownload several things and adjust settings even though I backed up and restored all data from my watch. A small complaint but, other than that, the whole system is working well together!	N

Verizon put my preorder for the s22 ultra on hold, has yet to ship.	Idk what I plan to accomplish with this other than to just vent and see if others have had this experience. I pre-ordered the s22 ultra on the 11th in store. My card was ran and I was unaware that the charge had dropped off of my bank account. Well on the 18th I got an email saying my payment method had failed and I needed to update it. I did so immediately, and it showed up on my credit card as a pending charge. My order still says "on hold" yet everyone I have talked to said I will have my phone tomorrow. It has yet to ship, I have no shipping information. The pending charge has posted. At this point I am very very frustrated and customer service is not helpful at all, even when I went into the store they just said "looks good on our end you'll have it on the 25th." I just want my new phone, I've been looking forward to this release all month. At this point I'm ready to cancel, but even if I do there is no guarantee I could walk into TMobile tomorrow and have a phone available to purchase...	N
S22 Ultra messages app doesn't have same features as 21 ultra	So I just got my new s22 ultra on verizon. The preinstalled Beta version of Google messages that came with the phone no longer gives me the option for imessage reaction or Google photo integration. I had all of these features on my Verizon branded S21 ultra. Has anyone had any issues activating these features on their new phone? I also did not have Carrier services on my S21 but it seems to be forced installed on my new one, should I disable it and hope it fixes itself? Anyone else having issues activating these features?	N

Finally Got My S22+ But How Can I Return My Old Phone?	I pre-ordered the Galaxy S22+ for trade-in at the T-mobile store and it finally came today but nothing else.

If I cancel my online order and go to a store and pre-order, is there a chance I'll receive it any sooner?

Reasons why you are not ordering the s22	Last day to preorder. Wondering why are you not ordering the s22.	N
Note 9 user switched to S22 Ultra after 3 years. Advantages and disadvantages between the two phones.	"These are some of the things I've noticed within my first few days of owning the phone. I know a few of these are features that were updated in previous S/Note phones, but they're still upgrades to Note 9 users like myself so I'll include them. Feel free to let me know if I'm missing anything
Pros:
WiFi 6
5G
120 hz display(adaptive)
4 Cameras (Ultrawide is nice to have. Was something I felt I was missing when the Note 10 came out. And all the other photography improvements)
Screen (brightness/color/size)
5000mah battery
45W fast charging
Reverse power share
S pen latency
Facial recognition is much faster/more reliable
Snapdragon 8 Gen 1
Adreno 730 
12 GB RAM
No bixby button 
Lost features:
Rear fingerprint on Note 9 was great! It was really fast, and I could have my phone already unlocked before it was even fully out of my pocket. Swiping down on it could pull down notification drawer. The Ultrasonic under display works well, but I kinda feel like Samsung did it to flex on Apple that they could do it first. All phones have empty real estate on the back and I thought it was a really smart use of it on the Note 9. Just my 2¢
Edge lighting (custom colors per app, the key word thing doesn't work the same) 
No Notification LED 
No expandable storage: (this isn't a huge deal for me because I opted for the 512GB vs my 128 GB Note 9 so I got plenty of space now, but it's still a lost feature)
I can't customize vibrations within Textra anymore
No headphone jack. Didn't really use it that often, but always liked that I could flex on iPhone people with it. (Pour one out for the homie)
Didn't there use to be a heart rate monitor?
P.S.
Obviously very happy overall so far and the ""lost features"" aren't that big a deal to me. I'd say the biggest one is the notification LED, which I knew it would be. (aodNotify is working very sporadically for me, but maybe just need to tweak the settings)"	N

S22 Ultra Exynos user here who's new to Samsung. Really disappointed by game performance. Is there really likelihood for a software fix/drivers needing to be released, or is that all copium?

exynos ruins the galaxy s22 ultra based on my experience after two weeks of using it (512 gb)	"i love this phone i adore it it's everything i wanted in a phone, but the performance is worse than my huawei mate 10 pro it's on par with my sony xperia xz1 which hasn't been reset in years
i get stutters everywhere and look at this, i held down the volume button and it lagged extremely noticably  [taltigolt på Twitter: ""this is unacceptable on 12 gb of ram exynos fails again it destroys good phones and we are forcefed it #GalaxyS22Ultra #S22Ultra https://t.co/H0gMG5ozZP"" / Twitter](https://twitter.com/ZZCOOL/status/1497084776448204803) 
&amp;#x200B;
the camera performance as i mentioned earlier is terrible just absolutely terrible photos look like they've been taken in low light with shaky hands, and based on what i can find this is exynos fault, i have a passionate hate for exynos and i am tempted to send the phone back because it feels like i bought it 4 years ago
it's not enough to purely lag but you do feel it everywhere you go it doesn't feel smooth"	N
Is the S22 Ultra a good device to replace my iPhone?	"I have been a loyal Apple user since the iPhone 4S, and currently own the iPhone 13 Pro Max, but am not impressed with the devices. They've been kind of the same for a while now, not much is happening design-wise, and progress is happening very slowly at Apple. I am not too caught up in the ecosystem, I only own an Apple Watch S7.

S22 telephoto pictures show up as 12mp	When I take pictures using the telephoto 3x on my s22, they save as 3000x4000 (12MP). I thought the telephoto camera was only 10MP? Is the phone upscaling the photos?	N
Is it worth upgrading from S9+ to S22 Ultra purely for the camera?	"Have no issues with the battery. I have no issue with slowness or anything. I love my phone. I love the 3.5 mm audio jack, the back of the phone physical fingerprint scanner, and all.

Biggest gripe switching to S22 after 10 years with iPhone.	"I just got the S22 Ultra and I seem to be allowed only 5 seconds to read my lock screen notifications. After that it goes black as I'm reading. This is so frustrating! 
I spent a few hours searching but it doesn't seem that lock screen timeout can be adjusted on Samsung phones.
On iPhone you can read your notifications just fine and the phone does not turn off after 5 seconds.
I would ask for help but I'm not sure there is a work around. I tried installing apps such as Good Lock etc but no luck.
This is mega frustrating for me as I use my phone for work and productivity and need to quickly read my notifications at a glance."	N
Finally got my phantom white unlocked 512g S22 ultra, but where the hell are all the camera options?	I can't even find the macro mode or even the different camera resolutions like I could on my Note 8. I don't wanna take basic photos at max resolution as it's a waste for work based stuff on slack	N
S22 battery life is a problem	People keep saying you need to run it a couple of days , but that sounds like some bias excuse the folks down at Apple would give . For the size of the battery I gotta be honest its disappointing and hasn't at least in that aspect lived up to the hype. S10 galaxy plus still might be the best phone pound for pound that Samsung has made . Edit: I already know about the usage learning phase pls stop telling me about that .	N
Meritcase for S22 Ultra	"Has anyone tried Meritcase's waterproof case for the S22 Ultra yet? I've had one on my Note 4 for about five years now, and I freakin' love this thing in terms of protection from both water (we get way too many heavy, spontaneous storms in Houston) and drops. My only complaint is that their new case does not have a kickstand, versus this Note 4 case with a horizontal/vertical kickstand. I do like that the back is clear vs the solid color on my current one.
If not Meritcase, is there a brand you can recommend that would fit the whole bill, or is that a hopeless cause?"	N
Can S21+ battery beats S22+ ?	I have an S10+ and I’m deciding to buy 22+ but I don’t like how it feels like an iPhone so I’m wondering if 21+ have a better battery and because I don’t care about camera features so the battery is the important to me	N
S22 Ultra (Exynos) lag?	"Just got my S22 Ultra today, its the UK Exynos model.

I have 8GB of RAM Plus set up and have processing set to high in the battery menu.
My Fold 3 just seems much smoother when it comes to animations. Anyone else noticing any stutter or lag?
I'm wondering if it has anything to do with the Snapdragon 888 vs Exynos 2200."	N
S22 ultra reset	I know its annoying, but i highly recommend everyone does a factory reset with the S22 after they set it up. I noticed so many gigs of random data that I didnt install and it was being laggy. I think this is from when it was activated during production. Regardless, it works so much better after and decreased about 10 gigs of random data	N
S22 Ultra Charging? What's going on with it?	"So I've been seeing a bunch of alerts about S22 Ultra Charging. Its pretty mix bucket imo. Some posts saying its not performing. Some saying its working fine, 20mins 45W 50%. 
I wanted to know from the users. Anyone who got the phone already, how's it doing charging wise. Are you using the Samsung 45W brick? Or 3rd party brick? 
I copped a UGreen 45W charger brick in wait for the phone yo come in, cuz I didnt realize they were shipping without the brick, or I wouldn't ordered the Samsung one. 
Anyone with 3rd party brick please lmk how your experience has been."	N

Using 1440p @ 120hz but I was toggling between 1080p &amp; 1440p and feel like I can't tell a difference.  I was poking around on Reddit/Instagram/TikTok but really couldn't see a difference.  
Is there something I can look at that really shows off the higher res option?"	N
s22 ultra feels laggy	it's not a lot but it does lag is this due to exynos?	N
S22 Ultra Vibration motor sucks	"Coming from a s21 Ultra the Vibration motor in the s22 Ultra sucks. I know they changed the motor to go side to side instead of back and front. The difference in strength is night and day. I have the Vibration intensity turned all the way up on the s22 Ultra but it feels like one of the lowest settings on the s21 ultra. 
Was this a cost saving measure? Because frankly my phone has been on vibrate only for years and this feels like a deal breaker for me."	N
Update: Samsung is now blatantly lying about S22 order statuses	"It is no secret that launch day was a complete mess. The website and app were both down in states of limited to no functionality for multiple days. Samsung did not acknowledge this. First red flag 🚩
The majority of us who did manage to get our orders through on launch day have been left with orders stuck ""processing"" with no movement or updates at all.
Instead of being transparent about the current state of their fulfillment teams, they are now sending hundreds of customers emails saying that ""extreme weather"" has delayed our orders. A blatant lie to customers who have already fully paid for a product whose status and whereabouts are completely unknown.
After a lengthy discussion with customer service today, they admitted that it is not severe weather. They are just unable to keep up. This should speak volumes to the companies organizational skills that after 15 days, they are still unable to sort out orders from the launch day.

Question regarding screen dimming	"Hi Everyone, 
So far I am really enjoying the S22 Ultra but one issue I have is keeping the screen from not dimming when I have it charging on a charging stand. 
I have developer mode on and set it to screen always on while charging, also, Adaptive brightness is set to off. 
When I put the phone on the charging stand it remains bright for about 15-20 seconds and then it goes to what looks like half the brightness. 
Any idea what setting I need to select to keep the screen bright constantly while charging? 
Thanks"	N

S21U to S22 users, give me your honest opinion.	"This is specifically for people who went from the S21 Ultra to the S22 Ultra. Are you satisfied? I was an S21 Ultra user, but decided to go to the S22 Plus instead of the Ultra. I thought the S21U seemed too big, and the size and weight of the S21U was pretty much my limit. Plus I didn't like the square corners or the curved screen. But, I'm having trouble getting used to the smaller size of the Plus, and I'm wondering if I should've just gone with the Ultra. 
Tell me how you feel?"	N
Rakuten	Has anyone seen their cash back from Rakuten on their preorders yet? I emailed them a week ago and they said they had to wait for Samsung to confirm my purchase, even though I gave them a copy of my order. When I preordered my N20U, I think that cash back showed up immediately.	N

Trading in Fold 3 towards s22	I have a Verizon fold 3 sitting in my drawer that I still owe Verizon about 1600 on. I was considering trading that in towards an unlocked S22 for my wife.

Is there a built-in screen protector on the Ultra S22 ?	On my old Note 10+ phone, there was a built-in screen protector out of the box. Over time, that thin piece of screen film started peeling off on the corners, so I just removed it entirely without issue. I'm wondering if the S22 Ultra phone has the same type of built-in screen protector, and if so, will it also peel off over time? I personally stopped using screen protectors because a good carry case for protection has always worked for me. I have never, ever, not even once, cracked a phone screen in the many years of smartphone usage...no exaggeration! I credit this to always using a good carry case.	N

Software Updates (Unlocked Phones, S22 Ultra)	"Hello. 
I have a S22 Ultra that I received last week like many here. My question is I am not getting the March update, I still have what the phone shipped with which is February 2022 update. I have read that the March 2022 update is out but my phone isn't picking it up when I manually try to search for any updates. Do carrier locked phones get the updates first? My mind would think that unlocked phones would get the updates first since they don't have to jump through the hoops of all the carrier stuff. 
This is the first phone that I have ever purchased that is factory unlocked. Usually I go through my carrier(Verizon). So I'm just curious, is it normal that I have no received the update yet because it takes longer for unlocked phones to get it or is it something else? 
Thank you for your help!"	N
Issue with Blood Glucose meter - Solved!	"Posted this to reddit as well, but... 
I have a One Touch Verio Flex blood glucose meter. When I switched to the S22Ultra, the app wouldn't see the meter. I could pair it with Bluetooth, but I'd get the ""an app is required to use this"" message. The app would go through the motions, but the connection screen shows no meter to connect to (as in the pic (although looking at the screenshot embiggened on the PC now, I see my error...).   
While on the phone with One Touch tech support just now they walked me through the setup, and when I got to that screen again I said ""I wonder if it's a dark mode thing?"" Tech support assured me that no way could it be a dark mode thing, I agreed and we had a laugh about the absurdity of it being a dark mode thing...while I changed to light mode and went through the steps again, just in case. 
It *was* a dark mode thing, as you can see in the pic if you look hard enough. I told him that they're probably gonna get a lot of these calls soon, so get the word out to his colleagues and he laughed again... 
tl;dr- If you can't connect to your glucose meter on the s22Ultra (Snapdragon), turn off dark mode and try again."	N

S22U Screen Protection	"I stopped by Zagg today as I usually do to get a glass screen protector. No glass from them for S22U and the guy wanted $70 for a soft screen protector.

Pixel 6 auto brightness vs S22 Ultra.	"I just got an S22 Ultra since my Pixel was really annoying me with bugs, signal drop, etc. and it's crazy to me how much better auto brightness is on the S22 Ultra compared to the Pixel 6. The brightness transitions are so much faster and smoother and so far, has been very accurate to ambient lighting. I'm confused as to why Google implemented such a poor auto brightness algorithm. 
That's really it, just wanted to say how nice it is to have a good auto brightness again."	N

Unlocked vs carrier model signal?	"Hello. I had a carrier model s21 ultra and have had my unlocked model s22 ultra for a few days. From what I've read, unlocked is supposed to have just as good signal and that the s22 ultra is supposed to have great upgraded signal. Well that doesn't seem to be my experience. It seems that my s22 is getting worse and unstable signal. My s21 ultra will get around 3 or 4 bars in my home. The s22 signal alternates between one and four bars and in-between. You can see it go up or down one bar at a time every 5 seconds at times. I kept moving my SIM card back and forward and the s22 gets around -99 to -105 dba while the s22 gets -118 to -108 dba. Also driving in some places in spotty connection with android auto, I think the bar said no signal longer compared to my s21. However, Google assistant worked fine, so maybe it wasn't out of signal?
Thing is though it hasn't really affected me much and I've been able to access my internet whenever I wanted to. It is at a fine speed even with low bars. There was maybe one or two times it's been slower than normal, but I'm not sure if that's not a different issue such as the website having trouble. 
Can my phone be defective or is there maybe a hardware difference between unlocked and Verizon model? Is Verizon doing anything shady maybe or do I need to try something. Both Verizon and sending support are not helpful telling me to contact the other. Is anybody else experiencing anything similar?"	N
Please Help me Figure out if the Unlocked S22 has s s a Different eSIM Menu Than the Carrier Branded Phones	"I had an S21 Ultra, and bitched and moaned a bunch about the ""SIM Card Manager Menu.""  Unlike the variety of eSIM in the rest of the Samsung world, the US version forced the user to set a default SIM (eSIM or physical SIM) for data, voice, and SMS.  The rest of the world version lets you set separate default SIMs for each.  
The US version precludes the common use case of one SIM for data and another SIM for SMS/voice.
Initially I was very happy when I got the S22 - it had the ""rest of the world"" SIM menu.  However, after the phone updated with the T-Mobile software, the good menu was gone and the crappy menu replaced it.  Put another way, T-Mobile vandalized my phone.  
That left me wondering if the factory unlocked phone had the better ""rest of the world"" menu.
So, if someone out there has an unlocked S22 US variant, I would appreciate if it you could check the SIM Card Manger Menu, and tell me if it looks like menu #1 below or Menu #2.
***Menu #1*** (note that there are separate settings to set default SIMs for calls, messages, and data.

Being honest	"I really don't care for the design of the S22 Ultra that much. I don't want a curved phone anymore. One of the things I'm experiencing using the s-pen on a curved phone is I end up running the pen right off the edge of the phone when trying to edit photos for example. Have experienced this since the Note 7 really. I want the high end specs of the ultra, but I'd really prefer the design of the S22+. The plus feels like a much more manageable size phone, having flatter edges vs a double sided curve is far better for gripping the device.
Don't get me wrong, this phone is absolutely fantastic so far. Let's not lie to ourselves though, this isn't an S series device. It's a Note with an S name.
I got the ultra because I was presented with a ridiculously good deal through my job to get it at a steal of a price. Couldn't say no. I do really like the phone so far though, just would prefer slightly smaller and a flat screen."	N

Any "Official" (Company or Employee) Updates from Best Buy?	"Have seen a few threads on various models and individual experiences.

Have also seen some on Twitter speaking authoritatively, though not claiming to actually be affiliated, about BB's situation. Not sure what to believe.
Every support avenue I've tried, including asking in store, has been as informative as a shoulder shrug at best. Outside of the 128GB model actually being in my store, most show various pickup dates around late March through mid/late April when I look at product pages. Mine in particular is just ""Sold Out"" instead of having an order button.
Rumors say BB never received *any* of the unlocked Ultra stock from Samsung that they were supposed to, except for 128GBs. April 1 is a placeholder because they have no idea when they will. But they think it'll be before that. No idea if that's true, but I know the 1TB was barely available at all from the start.
Just hoping for *something* more solid by way of an update. Whether I should expect April 1, earlier, or cross my fingers to see one by June. Radio silence from BB leads me to believe these things aren't coming anytime soon and they just don't want pre orders cancelled. (Which to be fair, mine 100% would be if I could get it from Samsung in weeks and BB in months)."	N

With Samsung's help I created an ordering mess! What to do now?	"Let me start off that I helped create the mess I'm about to explain. I'll admit that right off...  
On Feb. 9th, I pre-ordered a Red S22 Ultra but didn't take advantage of the *extra* ""pre-register"" $50.00 accessory credit as I had trouble like others even setting up the order. I also didn't initiate the Rakuten 12% cash back. $600.00 trade-in for my Note 20 Ultra. So, on Feb. 19th I decided to cancel the pre-order Red Phone and order again to get the total $250.00 accessory credit and (*now*) 10% Rakuten cash back.   
1) On Feb. 19th, I logon to [Samsung.com](https://Samsung.com) and hit the **Cancel button** for the Feb. 9th order. The only thing that actually gets cancelled are the ""credits"" (Spotify 3 months free, YouTube Premium – 4 Months Free, 6 Months Free of SiriusXM Streaming, &amp; my $200 Samsung Credit). I get an email stating that the phone cannot be cancelled.  
2) Same day (Feb. 19th) I go ahead and order the Red 256GB again, this time receiving the $250.00 accessory credit and (now) 10% Rakuten cash back.   
3) Feb. 19th I go on a Chat with Samsung. The Rep. assures me that he has notified the ""Fulfillment Department"" and my Feb. 9th **Phone** portion of the order will be cancelled too.   
4) Jump to Feb. 22nd and my Phone ordered for Feb. 9th is *still not cancelled*.  
5) At this point I'm fuming mad. Go on another chat and the Rep. states that there is **no way** to Cancel the original Feb. 9th Phone order but when it arrives, refuse the delivery and Samsung will credit back my credit card. UGH! They apparently have no way to contact/advise the Fulfillment Dept.  
6) At this point in time, I say what the hell, forget about these credits (Spotify 3 months free, YouTube Premium – 4 Months Free, 6 Months Free of SiriusXM Streaming) and Rakuten cash back and I'll just keep my original Feb. 9th order (due to arrive March 8th). The assured me *several times* that I can call and Samsung will provide me with a $200.00 credit voucher a few weeks after my delivery date.   
7) I said OK, and went ahead and cancelled the Feb. 19th order. Same crap, different day. The Phone itself isn't cancelled, credits are. Rep. says again, just refuse the delivery and Sammy will refund you the price paid.  
**Why in the world do you even display an active Cancel Button when a customer** ***cannot actually Cancel an entire order*****?**  
8) Now/today (Feb. 27th), Samsung is offering max $825.00 for my Note 20 Ultra, No more $100.00 memory upgrade to a 256GB but it would include a $100.00 Play Credit ( I could care less about this). I'd rather have a larger trade-in amount than the accessory credit. I do not really need much of what is offered and when you do receive that credit voucher, you cannot use it on everything that Samsung sells, just certain items and it's only good for 3 months (in the past, it took months for many items to even come back in stock).
*Should I order today* for the better trade in value (&amp; only 3% Rakuten cash back) and *refuse both pre-order phones when delivered* or just keep the first phone that arrives? I'm not so anxious that can't wait for an S22U until the end of March or the beginning of April.   
Just my luck, no phones at all will arrive and both will eventually show as being cancelled! LOL!  
Thanks for any advice!"	N

I didn't experience problems nearly as bad as a lot of other users reported; I have my settings cranked, WQHD+, Adaptive refresh etc, and my battery was fine. I did just come across from the Fold 3 however, so it could potentially have been that ""fine"" in my eyes has been skewed slightly by that. The main cause of concern for myself was that certain apps would just chug and stutter. Twitter for instance ran smoothly on my Fold, but the app on my Ultra would being visually clunkier than before. Scrolling didn't feel smooth like the previous device, or even my S21 Ultra before that. I did hold out for the first performance update, but even after that I still noticed these issue.
Having seen a few posts by users discussing their issues after setting up with Smart Switch, I decided to bite the bullet and fully reset my device with no backup. I sync my contacts with Samsung/Google as well as photos, so it wasn't a particularly hard task to set up again as new with a few screenshots for saving my homescreen. I will mention now I did attempt a reset of all settings + clearing the cache as another user suggested, but saw no marked changes to the reported performance issues I'd had.
&amp;#x200B;
After fulling restarting as new, and after redownloading my individual apps from the Google Play library, the device is running like a dream. Apps that previously stuttered now run smoothly with minimal to no issues, and the battery has shown noticeable improvement to the point I'm much more comfortable about using it with commuting when returning to office work next week. I also decided to run through some steps outlined on the XDA forums for general performance improvements ([https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/adb-no-root-extreme-samsung-optimization-guide-unleash-the-full-potential-of-your-galaxy.4376755/](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/adb-no-root-extreme-samsung-optimization-guide-unleash-the-full-potential-of-your-galaxy.4376755/)), but didn't debloat or use any ADB steps on my device. I did run through an app optimisation with Samsung Good Guardian - Galaxy App Booster as advised there.
&amp;#x200B;
I'll post some photos of my Battery Lifespan once I get more use out of it; unfortunately I didn't think to screenshot prior to the reset. 
**TLDR:** I can confirm for myself at least that after a full factory reset, I experienced a noticeable increase in device performance when setting up as new over using Smart Switch. I hope this helps people who were feeling apprehensive about resetting their device, but of course your mileage may vary compared to mine."	N

Anyone compare NIGHT vlogging with an iphone 13 vs s22?	"Hello,
I'm coming from a huawei lite p30. I like going into nature at night, and I was thinking about picking up a new smartphone to start night vlogging on youtube, using the front facing camera.
I'm not sure which phone would be better for my needs, i'm looking at the iPhone 13(not pro) or Samsung s22+.
I'm sort of leaning towards the s22+, just because i'm more of an android person, but i'm not sure. As I have no experience with iPhones or Samsung phones.
My previous phones were the Xperia XZ, and the Xperia Z3 Compact, and now my current Huawei p30 lite(terrible camera quality), all my phones have been mediocre with the front facing camera or front facing video. 
I would greatly appreciate the help."	N

Deciding between the following S22 plus cases	"Trying to decide between the following. I like the Torras and dbrand but obviously they don't probably give the same protection as the others which would be a concern. Also I like the idea of a kickstand (currently have the tough armor for my S10) but admit I don't use it often. I like the the kickstand on the UB Pro/Poetic models because of being able to use it has a pop socket like handle. UAG Pathfinder is also a possibility but figured the UB Pro/Poetic ones give similar protection with the added benefits of the kickstand. The Tough Armor I currently have for my old phone is good but scratches up easily on the back and it shows.
I'm not super concerned about having to show off the phone so don't need a clear case and have young kids so nothing too slim with little protection.
Things I like/dislike about the choices:
STA
Good: Decent protection, go to choice
Bad: Has KS but not a great one, one color, scratches easily on back.
TMC
Good: Sleek, good kickstand, good reviews.
Bad: Doesn't seem like a lot of protection, lesser known brand, one color.
PS/PR/UB Pro
Good: look nice, good protection, all have similar KS
Bad: Don't love having a cover over the charging port, bulky
UAG
Good: Probably best protection
Bad: Expensive, no KS
Dbrand
Good: looks really nice, good grip
Bad: Expensive, not sure about protection, no KS
If I'm missing or wrong about anything, please let me know since the only brands I've ever had have been Spigen (S10) and UAG (S3 &amp; S6).

Anyone finding the soft spots in the Samsung silicone case really annoying?	"**TL;DR: Phone is amazing. Silicone case is close to greatness, but the soft spots near power port and volume rockers make this case pretty annoying.**
Got the S22+ after using the P6 for a while. Love the phone so far and I've removed most of the Samsung bloatware while keeping some of the useful tweaks to the OS they've made. Huge step up from the disappointing P6.
My only complaint right now is the nearly perfect silicone case is completely ruined by random soft spots near the charging port and the volume buttons. Is everyone else seeing this on their cases as well or is mine defective? Because I fail to see any functional reason to not have support around these areas. I suppose these areas are the most prone to ""break"" when you put a rigid liner around the lip...but this isn't the solution.
In fact, I'd go as far as to say making it soft like this significantly reduces the utility of the case as dirt/lint/dust are easily trapped in there, requiring a cleaning way more frequently than my comparative iPhone silicone case from Apple."	N

Should i get an S21 Ultra over a S22plus?	"Hi everyone, where i am both the S 21U and S 22+ are essentially the same price now. I was wondering what you guys think would be the better purchase.
Specifically may i ask how the S21 Ultra handles indoor shots of people nowadays? I have a S10 am aware that this environment has always been a problem for samsung phones due to shutter speed/processing issues.
On the other hand, the 108mp front and 40mp rear (from what ive read) really do give significant advantages to how photos taken look."	N
base model s21, or s22?	"ive seen so many mixed reviews about the battery life on the new galaxy s22.  anyone switch back to their s21?

S21 is now worth $550 towards S22	Now that pre-orders are over the S21 has increased by $160 in value. Sub total to go from S21 to S22 is now $237.49. Probably still not worth it for most but just FYI. You also get $50 google play credit and 6 months of OneDrive 100GB.	N
Sending back my S22 Ultra and going back my S21 Ultra	"I am normally the kinda guy that gets a new phone every year so despite having no issues with my S21 Ultra I decided to take advantage of Samsung's killer trade in deals to upgrade (and get an upgrade of my Tab S7+ for only $25 more).
Unfortunately after 3 days with it I knew the S22 Ultra wasn't for me. I have yet to find a major use case for the pen but the biggest issue is the design itself. I have small hands and can barely manage the S21 Ultra although One Hand Operation+ helps a lot. The problem ultimately is that even though the S22 Ultra is only 2mm wider than the S21 Ultra it feels even bigger thank to the boxy shape. This ultimately made me not even enjoy using the phone which at this price is a problem.
Overall I am kinda upset that I couldn't make it work due to the deal I got but I'd much rather keep my amazing S21 Ultra for another year than a phone that is too big for my hands or downgrading to something like the S22+.  Hopefully Samsung can continue on their track record of adding new features to former flagships to improve them as this will be the first time since I switched to Samsung with the S10 that I haven't gotten the latest model."

S-Pen Interchangability w S22Ultra and Note 20 Ultra	"I have been able to confirm that the Note 20 Ultra Spen fits perfectly fine with the S22 Ultra. However the S22 Ultra will fit in the silo and ""pair"" (just like the n20u pen) BUT it will not perfectly fit and have that ""snap"".
I hope this isn't confusing, but my wife (n20u) and I (s22u) tested this and I'm totally not gonna steal her white n20u pen to pair with my s22u pen. I'll just buy one like a real gentleman. Hope this helps!!!

Questions about Trade In + New Line Promo for S22	"I swear they try to make this whole process as confusing as possible so you can't easily take advantage of the offers but are persuaded to upgrade because of them. And based on past experiences, I’m not confident someone in the store would be able to answer any of this for me. So I'm hoping my fellow Redditors can explain how to get the best deal. 
Relevant Info (let’s call this phone/plan Line 1):
1. Current phone: Note 10+ 256GB in Aura Blue from Best Buy (looking to trade this in)
2. Current plan: 5G Start
3. Current Lines on account: 5 (I think max is 6?)
4. New Phone Desired: S22, S22+, or S22 Ultra
5. Willing to run a 6th line for 1-2 months if it means a couple hundred dollars      extra in promo/trade value, but would definitely want to cancel it and not      continue paying any more than 2 months for a line I don’t want.
Questions:
1. Are there better promos I should consider than the one offered by Verizon?
2. How can I expect to receive these promos: As a monthly credit/reduction to my bill, as a Mastercard gift card, or something else?
3. Can I use Verizon Device Dollars in conjunction with promos?
4. If I add Line 6, do I have to have a phone active on that line? 
1. If so, does it need to be the new phone (S22) in order to get the discounts? 
2. If so, what are my options with Line 1, since I will have traded in my Note 10+? Will I need to get another phone to keep on Line 1 until I can close Line 6 and transfer the S22?
3. How quickly can I cancel line 6 without forfeiting discounts/promos?
5. Roughly what would my initial out of pocket cost be for this, and my new monthly bill (just for this line, so I can compare to what it is now)?

Trade-in Issue With S22 Pre-order	"Pre-ordered an S22 and S22 Ultra for the two lines I have. But when I went to download and print off the shipping labels for the trade-in phones, I noticed they weren't exactly the same as the phones that were on the account prior and the IMEIs don't match up.

Singal quality degraded notably single getting S22+	I will note upfront signal strength at my (inside) home has never really been great. However, since getting my S22+ (upgrading from S20), things have really degraded. More often then not, my I am not getting 5G nor even 4G, but 1 or 2 bars of GSM. I have called T-Mobile and they have done whatever voodoo they do, but to no avail. Their best advice was to set the phone to 4G/3G/2G rather than 5G/4G/3G/2G that has helped at the margins, but not significantly. What is especially disappointing is the reviews suggesting that the S22 with the X65 modem would notably hold a weaker signal better than the older X60 (S21) or the X55 in my S20. When I am outside, there is a notably better signal, and I understand the impact that walls &amp; windows can have on cellular, but I'm just comparing what I had in the house before with the S20 and what I have now.

S22 Ultra - Amazing Phone, but One Criticism	"Owner of the S22 Ultra here, I adore the phone! It's an absolute beast and I'm so happy to have the Stylus back just like the note series. However I have one criticism/issue with the phone. 
When doing things like cropping, selecting, or writing with the Pen on the edges of the screen, the incredibly annoying curve pulls the pen right off the display. It's such a pain to be cropping an image, and when you get near the curve it just sucks it right down and messes up the crop or whatever you were doing with the Pen.
I really hope the next phone we just get a flat piece of glass. Enough with this curved display that brings absolutely no functionality to the phone and is just becoming a clunky ""feature"".
Again, this is my only one minor critique, because other than that the S22 is perfect in my opinion. I'm in love with this thing...."	N

Yet Another S22U (Non) Power User Review	"Good evening fellow Samsung-ites!
Like many of you, I was frothing at the mouth when I got the notification that my pre-order had shipped well before Feb 25. I was also distraught when it got delayed two days from Feb 21 to Feb 23 due to still unknown reasons. The battery has settled, and I am here to offer a non-power user's opinion to the huge whirlwind of information swirling around the latest entry to the smart phone world.
**Device**: 512GB Phantom Black Snapdragon S22 Ultra
***Display***
The display is large, clear, and gorgeous. As a user who games and streams TV shows and movies, this display shows you everything. Even the FHD setting is higher quality than what the S10+ I upgraded from had to offer. I have not tried the highest settings, but most of that is because I've been trying not to burn the battery too fast just yet.
Clarity is not lost even on powersaving mode which I think speaks volumes about the advances Samsung has tried to bring to the table in the display department. 
***Camera***
Wow. Both for the quality and the number of cameras. The detail you can get from this camera system is impressive. Not only is it clear with bold colors, but the detail is insane. I'm not even sure my 20/20 vision can see the kind of definition these cameras get of the individual hairs on my cats.
My only complaint is the way the rear camera stack juts out, both from the phone and the way it's molded on my phone case. 
Probably worth mentioning how the camera still struggles with moving subjects, but that has been rather widely reported.
***S Pen***
Long ago I had a lovely device whose brothers and sisters decided to try to blow up several planes and homesteads. I'm very happy to return to the club and enjoy S Pen functionalities and to have the pen live with the phone. 
I've noticed very low delay and very accurate tracking. I've also been extremely impressed with how accurately the phone can understand my chicken scratch when I use the handwriting to text function. 
It likely will simply take more practice on my part, but certain air gestures are still hard for me to execute, and certain apps don't respond to them despite setting them in the S Pen menu.
***Battery***
This has been the reason I waited until today. 4th full day with the device, and second on powersaving. Everyone has been obsessed with the battery life or lack thereof of this device. 
The first couple of days were rough during calibration. Add in some heavier than normal streaming early on and I was right there with most of the naysayers.
But,  here are today's stats on regular powersaver:
* 33% left
* 13h 27 m since last charge
* 7h SOT
* 6h 36m left (supposedly)
I guess powersaver is cheating, but these look like pretty great numbers to me. As a guy who mostly games or reddits and peppers in some streaming, these numbers are very encouraging. 
My only lingering detraction would be that my wireless charger seems to charge a little slower than my S10+, but then again the battery is much bigger and not aged like my old device. 
***Final Thoughts***
I love the S10+ I came from. If it weren't for some fantastic pre-order and trade in incentives, I might not have upgraded just yet. However, I am not regretting the decision at all.
Despite being larger, it's extremely comfortable in my hand. The processor power is evident even when handicapping the device with powersaver mode.
I think battery concerns are somewhat overblown, but you can tell the big battery is necessary to keep the beautiful screen running wonderfully. 
I'm very much looking forward to discovering what else the S22 Ultra has to offer, and if things keep going as they are, I will definitely try to keep this device well past the 3 year mark. 
Enjoy your new devices friends, try not to let the waiting drive you too crazy."	N
Upgrading from Oneplus 6T to Samsung S22+	I never thought I'd ever leave Oneplus but the company went downhill after ruining the perfectly good Oxygen OS. I am super excited and have already pre booked the S22+ in white colour. I can't wait for March 11th and finally get my hands on it. As this is my first Samsung flagship purchase, do you guys have any tips for me? Or something that I should try out in OneUI as soon as I get it. Let me know because I am very excited!!	N
Galaxy S22 Battery life	"Hey guys!  kind of a rant or a vent more than anything useful to anyone.  I got my new Galaxy s22 from Samsung the other day And so far it's been great!  Definitely a nice phone.  My only real complaint so far is battery life.  it isn't awful it's just weird that a phone with a 3700mah battery is similar to my iPhone 12 mini.  
every other year I switch back and forth between Android and iOS because it's fun to use different phones and I love both for different reasons.  I wasn't really expecting however to have such a ""it's fine"" battery life.  before my iPhone 12 mini my Galaxy s10e was pretty great, it wasn't the best but it did fantastic.  it's not so great now that it's a 3 year old phone but still.  when I got the iPhone 12 mini I was pleasantly surprised a phone with only 2227mah could provide such a decent battery life.
so far from the very short time I've had the s22 the battery life has been very similar to my now, 1+ year old iPhone 12 mini.  more testing is required but first impressions says ""this isn't the small phone you're looking for"""	N
Should I upgrade to S22+ or S22?	"I current own a Note20 (Exynos Chip Variant) which I got on it's release date and now I am thinking if I should upgrade to the S22+/S22. I am happy with my current device but upgrade to samsung allows me to exchange my old phone for a good amount.
I was anyway planning to upgrade to the iPhone 14 Pro or something equivalent sometime around Oct-2022.
Any opinions?"	N
Upgraded to S22 from iPhone!!	"I've been wanting to switch for a long time and I'm so happy I finally did it! I've been jealous of my wife's Z flip and all the cool things she's able to do and now I can finally set my phone up just the way I want it. 
I've done nothing all day except stare at my screen and mess with all the customization available. I really thought I was going to regret the choice as soon as I switched (it's happened before) but wow! I'm so pleased. Also as someone who hates heavy/boxy phones the S22 is so nice to hold with one hand."	N
S22 Ultra Can't Install Snapseed	I cannot install Snapseed from the Play Store no matter what I do. I cleared cache and data. It just says "pending" and never downloads. This is the only app I am having this issue with so far. Is anyone else experiencing this?	N
S22 Ultra Network Band Selection Saving Battery(But It works on s22 as well, probably other newer samsungs too)	"So l enabled anything except NR so far, and my battery
life has increased dramatically. 
It seems this phone kills itself trying to connect to 5G when the 5G signal is weak.
If you live in a strong 5G zone and dont have wifi
available I suggest not using this.
But, if you have wifi and no need for 5G or the 5G signal is kinda bad, try using this and Imk if it helps your battery life?

Extremely satisfied with S22 Ultra battery life	"So I pre ordered my S22 Ultra and have been using it for about 5 days now. Before I got my hands on it, I watched a couple of reviews that stated that the battery life was not as good as S21 Ultra. This had me concerned and almost made me cancel my order. But I'm happy to report that this phone is a battery beast. I was home all day today and wanted to see what's the maximum screen on time I could get out of this thing with normal usage. From jumping between YouTube, reddit and tiktok with plenty of messeging in between, I ended up with about 10 hours of screen on time from 100% to 1%. For me personally, this is a 2 day battery. On usual work weekdays I never find myself using my phone for more than 5 hours. So if you're looking to get this device and your biggest concern was battery life, I'd tell you to put that aside and go for it! 
Some notes:
I was using adaptive refresh rate with WQHD+ resolution. My data was turned off as I was on wifi throughout the day. I didn't play any graphically intenvise games. I also have the 12 GB RAM version if that makes any difference. 
If anyone have any questions about the phone let me know and I will share my experience!"	N
S22 or ZFlip 3 ?????!!!!!	"So in the UK vodafone is offering the S22 (just the normal version no + or ultra) and the ZFlip 3 at effectively the same price with trade in (S10e).
\- love the idea of owning a folding phone but am worried the novelty will ware off and the durability
\- the S22 comes with the buds pro which I believe will work well with my laptop (Galaxy book) 
Really cant decide between them and even if this is the right time to upgrade, could wait another year for the next Flip but S10e might not be worth much then.
Opinions???!!!
Thank you to anyone who replies : )!!!!!"	N
S22	Well, how is everyone liking the S22s? I just got mine Friday and haven't really had a chance to check out any of its features till now. Looking pretty promising	N
Microphone on the S22 ultra	Hi! I'm wondering what the microphone quality is like on the S22 ultra? I'm especially curious how it works for those of us with deep voices. All the phones I have owned I have to use a higher pitched voice for it not to cause issues when talking in the phone (getting filtered out, not picking up my voice at all, etc.) does anyone else have any similar experiences and know whether or not the S22 ultra does it as well?	N
S22U vs Fold 3	"I'm having a really hard time deciding if I really like my s22U after having had my fold 3 since August.
So I've come from a note 9 that i had for a year and a note 10+ that I held on to for 2 years. I paired a z flip with my note 10+ cause I loved the idea of a foldable phone but the novelty wore off really fast and I ended up using my note way more than the flip. When they revealed that there would be no new note in 2021 (which I had planned on upgrading to) I went for the fold 3 and traded in both my note and my flip for it. For the first few months it was cool but then I started missing my note and was looking into getting one again. Then I started having an issue with the inner screen protector on the fold and was really unhappy that I was having issues with such an expensive phone that I convinced myself that I was gonna trade my fold in for the new s22u cause it was the new ""note"". After I sent my fold in to samsung for repair I had to go back to my old iPhone 6s+ for the TWO WEEKS it took for them to sort things out and cover it under warranty. By the time I got my fold back I had a whole new appreciation for it. I decided not to trade it in for the s22u but I still wanted one so I got myself one. Now that I have both its really hard to say which one I'd prefer. I love how easy this one is to type on but media consumption just isn't as nice on this as it is on my fold. I LOVE the cameras on the s22u though and the feeling of the durability of the device since i do doordash often and have my pgone with me a lot. I'm considering sending the s22u back but I guess if I have to opportunity to keep both I might as well. I've got a kid on the way and I want to make sure that I have some of the best cameras I can't get to capture all the best moments(aside from the video on the iPhone 13PM) 
Idk what the point of this post was honestly I just wanted to rant ig"	N
My experience with dropping my S22 Ultra on the ground !	"So I returned from work and while I was making sure my motorcycle was secure, my S22 Ultra dropped from right chest pocket of my jacket along with my heart. I didn't notice at first since music was playing in my earbuds but after checking where my phone was, my heart almost stopped as I got scared that I dropped my phone while on the way. Since it was really dark where I parked my bike, I lost my senses for a couple of seconds thinking where it could've been dropped and after gaining back my reasoning power, I searched the ground and there it was, laying facing screen down. 
Again, my heart skipped a beat since it was laying on gravel ground and I was sure my screen got damaged even though it got Spygen NeoFlex Screen protector, protecting it. To my surprise, after removing the screen protector I don't know if it's the Gorilla glass Victis+ saving itself or it having the additional layer of protection, screen wasn't damaged as much as I thought when it fell from almost 4ft, only two small dents which are only noticeable if looked from certain angle. This time I didn't want to take a chance and ordered Whitestone Dome tempered glass. Fingerprint scanner was a hit and miss but its working 60% of the time so it's a normal tradeoff for protection I suppose. 
TLDR: I dropped my S22 Ultra on gravel ground which left two barely noticeable dents on my screen."	N
S22 Ultra stuck in Texas	"I ordered the black 256gb S22 Ultra and a watch with the $200 credit Samsung on February 16th and received an estimated delivery of March 4 for both. they ended up shipping on the 22nd of February and I was given a new estimated delivery date for the 25th, but it's been stuck in Coppell Texas since the 23rd. FedEx eventually updated it to show that it was delayed yesterday morning, but there is still no update on where it's at. I know some other people have had similar issues, especially since FedEx is the one handling most of these orders. My brother also ordered one and we have identical shipping dates and updates.  
I wonder if there some delay due to weather or if it's just FedEx being FedEx. I'm hoping they update the estimated shipping soon since I have school, my brother has work, so it's difficult to have someone at home between 8am-8pm every day. Has anyone had the same issue with orders being held in Texas with no reason given? If so, how long was it until it was finally delivered?"	N

S22 Ultra texting photos issue	I texted a few photos to my wife who also has an S22 Ultra. First time I have tried that with this phone. She received and can see the photos within the text thread but she can't open them fully. There is a little lock symbol below the bottom picture. On my phone in the chat thread it is also showing the lock symbol too. Any ideas what this means and how to resolve it? I would assume it is a setting on my S22 Ultra and not hers?Never had this issue with any of my other Samsung phones.	N
The S22 Ultra is a thrill!	"After spending years with an iPhone, my return to Android has never been more enjoyable. I forgot all the awesome benefits of not being in such a ""closed source"" ecosystem. 
Also, Samsung has made fantastic strides with its android skin 👏. I remember how bogged up and terrible they used to be. 
Performance has been great for what I do, not incurred any issues with the exynos chipset which appears promising, although I'm using a slightly lower screen resolution until they fix that silly software bug.
Overall, really pleased. Can't wait for the Buds Pro to arrive, and the 12 months of Disney+ is a welcomed addition.
Bravo Samsung, Bravo."	N
Samsung S22u exynos version battery optimisation	"Just spoke to Samsung on the phone about my poor battery life, since I hard factory reset my phone yesterday and only added my contacts, and reinstalled my apps one by one, as of now I've got 3hours 48 mins SOT with a  percentage of 55% all on WiFi, when the battery learns my battery usage patterns, will the battery life improve, as the Samsung spokeswoman said that It can take between 1-2 weeks for the battery to be fully optimised for my usage, has this been the case for you guys did your battery life improve? 
If not I'm gonna ask for a replacement device because I doubt it's every exynos with this problem."	N
1 TB S22U stock	I keep checking for the past week and the 1 TBs are never back in stock . Samsung chat keeps telling me they have no info. Is there no one in the Samsung sphere who has information on restocking ??	N
I absolutely love S22 Ultra.	I've always been big on upgrading phones with new releases. Changes are not huge on S22 Ultra when compared to S21 Ultra or even Note 20 Ultra, but they are significant enough. For example, finally Samsung Keyboard that can keep up with my fast typing and no noticeable lag or delay. Battery is great, camera is slightly improved, speakers in my opinion is better on S21 Ultra. Display quality is already great so very little can be done to improve. It's very snappy and just works a bit better overall even when compared to S21 Ultra. Just wish edges didn't feel like knifes 😄	N
Is your S22 lagging?	"So my brother has the s22 and i have the ultra. We are both gamers and are well.... quick to notice lag on these things. On my brothers s22, if he rapidly switches apps between idk reddit and discord, then tries to click on mesages on discord to test touch latency,  the touches will literally lag hardcore. I also noticed this OCCASIONALLY on my ultra, but not nearwhere as consistent and reproducible  on his phone. 
So we managed to fix it. I never got any lag whatsoever after i turned the ram+ to max 8gb. So I thought, what the heck why dont you turn on your ram+ to 8gb too. So after that his phone reset he opened up tons of apps and tried repeating the issue. Never lagged ever again.
Imo I think it has to due to something  with idle ram even when all apps are closed. For me the system idles at 6/12 gbs ram and for him it idles  on 4/8gbs of ram. It might be because the UI has all these features that hog up tons of ram or whatever, but nonetheless  if you do experience  any kind of lag on these phones, why dont you try enabling ram+ to 8gb."

Crypto.com app crashing ui launcher on s22 ultra (snapdragon)	"The only fix I can find so far is Uninstalling it from the Google play store. If you try to Uninstall from the ui launcher itself it will freeze or crash all together. Has anyone else experienced this?

Samsung Galaxy S22 review	"I got my S22 on Tuesday 3 days before released date and i have to say i’m not impressed but good phone. It’s better than S21 but it’s nothing major to go crazy about
Display: It’s 1300 nits display bright enough but S22+ and S22 Ultra are 1750 nits. The display is bright and great color accuracy 10/10
One UI 4.1: Nothing major from One UI 4.0 but good improvements, it’s fast with no lag at all, it’s not heavy like TouchWiz was. 10/10
Camera: It’s great and probably the biggest improvements from S21, the 3X optical zoom is great and sharp with no distortion. It take awesome pictures and night pictures are good enough 10/10
Battery: The battery is the weakness of the S22, i have to charge it 2 times a day because i’m a heavy user. Everyone using their phones different but this is my experience 8/10
Final score i’m giving the S22 is 9/10"	N
S22 Ultra's S-Pen - I hate the texture of it!	"Coming from a Note 10 Plus user.
Removing it from the slot is SOOOOOO much more difficult due to the rubbery-like texture of the S-Pen!  It is like having sex without lube!  Anyone else feels this way?!  I hope Samsung releases new S-Pens that has the similar feel of the Note 10 Plus.  I will gladly buy them!"	N
This battery is killing me (S22U)	"I have the S22U unlocked us variant, and the battery life is frustrating. The phone will easily last all day if I'm not using it, but the minute I turn the screen on, it gets extremely hot and my battery life falls off a cliff. I watched YouTube for 45 minutes last night and my phone so hot it was uncomfortable to hold, and it used probably 16.8% of my battery.
Hopefully we get a software update to fix this soon
Edit: so I changed the display resolution from WQHD to the middle level and that seems to have made a huge difference so far. Unbelievable"	N
Best plastic screen protector for S22 Ultra?	Thr S22 does not come with a screen protector like my note 10 did. So im looking for something that will take scratches over scratching my screen, no glass ones i never had any luck getting any of them to work with the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor	N

s22 ultra changes color temp for no reason	"I thought I was going crazy seeing a yellow tint sometimes after the update then I finally saw it, as soon as I unlocked my phone the color temp changed from warm to cold
I've now tried unlocking it a few times and it jumps between warm and cold randomly I've also noticed the brightness changing sometimes despite having adaptive set to off
eyecomfort is also off i never turn that thing on, i caught it changing color temp now clearly, i opened the settings panel and it wen't from a yellow tint to no tint, it did this infront of my eyes this time it wasn't subtle either, it is very difficult to notice but if you're sensitive to any kind of yellow tint you'll feel it.
you may not see the change but if you look closely and compare both grays one is brown and another isn't, these photos were taken seconds apart and all i did was unlock and lock the phone multiple times to compare what i was seeing, this change was clearly visible to my eyes, so it's not the camera that causes the color to be slightly different.

Compared the S22 Ultra to my Note 20 Ultra	"So yesterday I went to my nearby Samsung store to check out the new S22 Ultra and compare it a bit to my Note 20 Ultra.
I can't believe I'm saying this but in many aspects the S22 Ultra seems to be worse. 
So let's start with the design, almost identical. The S22 Ultra is a hair shorter and a hair wider than the Note 20 Ultra but you won't ever notice in day to day use. I loved the fact the side rails where substantially thicker and and the screen was ever so sightly less curved making it overall more comfortable in the hand. Also the green color looked stunning! 
Screen, I always thought my Note 20 Ultra was bright but comparing it to the S22 Ultra I was stunned how dim it was in comparison! I checked out the QHD+ setting with the adaptive refresh rate and even though you could see a slight improvement in sharpness I don't think it's really worth it. Colors look identical to my eye. 
Cameras, okay Samsung what the hell happened here?! The photos of the S22 Ultra look worse than my Note 20 Ultra. The colors are extremely muted, I understand some people prefer that sort of look but to my eye it looked awful in comparison. The photos were also horribly oversharpened which gave the S22 Ultra more of a cheap smartphone photo look. The zoom and ultra wide camera's had the same processing problems. But at the very least the main sensor now uses the more common 24mm focal length which is nice!
Performance, so I have to note that I live in Europe so I have to deal with the Exynos versions of both phones. I never had any issues with my Note 20 Ultra in terms of performance, the phone has always been extremely snappy and continues to be to this day. The only drawback is the awful battery life but I digress. Checking a phone out at the store is never truly a good indication of day to day performance anyway but I was still curious. I opened up some apps, did some scrolling, app switching, browsing, etc and there seemed to be a lot of random micro stutters during my time with the S22 Ultra. Not only that but some apps took ages to load compared to my Note. I know a big software update is promised so let's be hopeful but it seemed to perform worse than my Note 20 Ultra side by side which is worrying. 
All in all though the problems I mentioned could theoretically be ironed out with software updates. I want it to be fixed because I was hoping to upgrade to the S22 Ultra but not like this. I'm holding off for a few more months and will wait if they fix anything. Let's hope they do. Because this is unacceptable for €1300"	N
'taro' board? S22 Ultra	"[CPU-Z Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/w7Wa0C9)
So I got my S22U 12GB RAM (supposedly Snapdragon variant, based on country) 2 days back and I noticed I was getting some fps drops when playing Genshin Impact.
At first I thought I was getting the Exynos variant which many users reported laggy performance about. I then went to downloaded CPU-Z to check what's up.
On the device tab, it's showing 'taro' for the Board and 'qcom' for Hardware. Based on this, I'm certain I have a qualcomm chip but I can't find any info on this 'taro'. Anyone has any ideas?"	N
Samsung S22 Ultra first impressions	"Hopefully I can keep this short, but I came from a OnePlus 9 that broke because of my stupidity and love that thing to death and decided to give Samsung a try (a third time) and see how it'd fare out. I got to say, i'm very impressed, but not without a few nitpicks.  
The likes:  
\- Screen (with a caveat) is absolutely stunning and that peak brightness allows me to enjoy content I wouldn't be able to otherwise on other displays  
\- The general design of the phone. It's sleek and looks great in matte black and without that camera bump which I personally didn't like. The rounded edges also allows one handed holds to feel comfortable in the hand.  
\- The battery life. I was skeptical at first because I came from a phone I could panic charge and would last a long time after the fact. However, the sheer battery life on one charge alone is enough to make me rethink fast charging as a whole. The 45w fast charging is definitely enough for me  
\- The camera. Damn, i'm a photographer by hobby and this thing really stands out even against my own camera. The zoom capabilities far outmatch any other phone in the market right now and makes it convenient for travels where I don't want to be burdened by my camera and tripod.  
\- The s-pen. I got the S22 Ultra because of the camera, but now I fell in love with the pen. Not only is the experience super smooth, you can do a lot of things with it that I wouldn't be able to do with any other phone. Like take photos remotely with the s-pen, which is something I personally adore.  
\- OneUI. I came from OnePlus and Apple and those were really barebones and nice experiences. OneUI seems to be almost as good as those two if not better in some aspects and I can respect that.  
The personal nitpicks:  
\- The display leans over to the warm side even if the the white balance slider is all the way towards the cool side. I personally never liked yellowish tints and idk if it's my display but it makes skin tones in various pictures look very ""yellow"". It's a stunning display, but I wish I did have more control over the colors a bit like I did with OnePlus. Even a saturation slider or a broader white balance range would be a huge step up personally.  
\- ""bloat"". Love how they managed to make the bloat not intrusive, but many apps just shouldn't be there at all like the wearables app. Once again, JUST a nitpick. This hasn't hindered my experience with the phone.  
\- Curved screens. I just don't like curved screens, that's it. However, compared to the OnePlus 8 I had before with a curved screen I like the way Samsung did it compared to how they did it.  
I went a bit more in depth about this in a video I made but I shouldn't self promote so i'll leave it as is.  
As for what i'd like to see in the future it's really just the display configureability. the OnePlus 9 had an ""AMOLED wide gamut"" mode which I thought was pure eye candy. While many people do not like oversaturated colors there are people who really like that added amount of flexibility as to what you can do with the colors of your display. Otherwise, aside from skin tones looking really yellow on my screen compared to other phones i've used, this is an exceptional phone."	N
the s22 ultra is a great phone but it should have been made by sony it hardwarewise it feels like it was	"samsung is still not perfect and they damage their own brand
first off theres exynos the biggest issue that cripples samsung phones
then there was the sudden finding out that eyecomfortshield can't be turned off, it can just be reduced, eyecomfort and less blue light is something sasmsung has advertised a lot, i started noticing that my display wen't warm for no reason, someone told by this was by design, which makes sense as they do use less blue light in their advertisements, it's something they force as they think thats what people want.
then theres the lag and microlag for no reason as i described plenty of times likely exynos related
&amp;#x200B;
sony phones don't have these decisions that samsung forces on us like kids mode for example
&amp;#x200B;
i adore the s22 ultra i really do but it's damaged by samsungs decisions, i thought this time it was different as i've been fairly happy with oneui, using good lock made the ui not look like typical oneui with rounded curves everywhere that i dislike  
sony phones don't force things on the user in the same manner as samsung does samsung has an ecosystem and a decision how their phones should function regardless of what the user wants, sony just provides a phone and let's the user be in charge of it it's a blank phone rather than samsung which is a pure samsung phone, with all it's pros  and cons, the only thing i can compare with sonys decisions is the forced gamebar on sony phones and forced auto brightness"	N
Trade in Z Flip3 5G For S22 Ultra?	"The Flip's battery life and camera (relative to Ultra) are severely lacking, but the cool factor and size of the Flip make changing difficult.

For everyone having problems with their Exynos S22!	"I also had an extremely laggy and terrible experience out of the box, but I found some settings that really help alot.
First find the power saving settings and make sure everything is turned off. I had my cpu limited to 70% speed.
then go to battery settings, more battery settings and set processing speed to high or maximum.
Changing these settings has made it feel almost as snappy as my old zenphone 8.
Hope this helps!"	N
S22 battery life	Other than turning it off, what's the best way to conserve battery life on the regular s22 when it's not in use? Say when it's sitting on your nightstand overnight. Any special settings?	N

Messages app starts with big header taking half the screen	Ugh, So many small differences from my S21 to S22.

Hope we get a update to make this battery better....	"I got the T-Mobile S22 Ultra and i am at 74% with only 1hr 56m of screen on time and to me that is pretty bad considering this phone has a bigger battery 5000mah than my old phone 4100mah so im kinda disappointed so far. I have these battery settings turned on even to help like adaptive battery,processing speed on optimized,a bunch of unused apps put to sleep, and i even disabled some apps that are really not necessary to me. Screen time out at 30 seconds,dark mode always on,both my wallpapers for home and lock screen are dark. I also dont use any fast charging or super charging just normal charging using the samsung 45w charger i got with it. 
Any advice? I had this phone for 5 days now and also would like to add my wifi is on all the time and i use wifi mostly for data but still it was the same way on my old phone which was a s10 plus and it did better throughout the day."	N
S22 Ultra had to reset my Galaxy Watch 4	"Had to reset my Galaxy Watch 4 as it was hooked to the S21 Ultra

How do i fix the new Samsung skinned Google Messages for S22/+/Ultra?	I have the new Samsung S22 Ultra and have used Google Messages as my default SMS app since my S10 days. But this new S22 version changed the chat bubbles to green instead of the usual light blue (still dark blue for my fellow Google Messages app contacts), with no option to change the colors. Also, the entire top half of my conversations screen is blank and it just says "Messages". How can I change the colors, and how do I get the top of my screen to be the start of my conversations??? Please help!!	N
Transferring a very large sms file	"I tried to move a very large sms file using Samsung Smart Switch but it freezes up when it reaches the export of text messages. The file is upwards of 20gb in size. I don't want to elect to delete everything before 2 years (one of the options presented in Smart Switch).  
I tried to use SMS back up and restore app by backing up my SMS file to Google Drive but that has been trying to restore for the last 2 days and is only at 12%. I'm 90% sure it will not complete the transfer.  
I also tried to back up the entire phone to Google but it doesn't back up the texts and there doesn't seem to be any option to back it up either.  
Can anyone recommend a way to move these texts over to my new S22 ultra? It's frustrating as apple has no limitations on how far back your messages go. They don't force you to delete your entire file or purge most of it just to move to a new phone. Surely android has a solution for people that want to move a large sms file? Thanks in advance for any help."	N
S22U less RAM than s21u	Just setting my s22u up. Notice that these only have 12gb RAM, where s21u has 16gb. What gives? I know can setup ram+	N
How is the battery life on S22?	I've used the S21+ for a while and after all the optimizations I've done, pretty happy with the battery life. Considering the regular S22 for the small size but concerned about battery life. If I'm not playing games and use dark theme for everything, how is the battery life based on your experience??	N
Restoring Google Messages restores everything including Archived into Inbox	When I'm setting up the new phone and restoring Google Messages, it restores every single text I've ever archived, which is fine, but it restores it to the inbox. So now I have to select over 1000 messages to archive them again. Any way to just restore the messages in the inbox?	N
