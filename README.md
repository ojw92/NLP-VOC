# NLP-for-Text-Classification

This repository contains notes and project files related to natural language processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis / text classification.

Please refer to BERT_VOC.ipynb for the updated version of the classification model.

Some of the concepts utilized in the project files and covered in the notes include:

    * NLP & sentiment analysis
    * data cleaning (preprocessing) for NLP
    * BERT & its variants
    * word embeddings
    * convolutional neural network (CNN)
    * recurrent neural network (RNN)
    * Bag-of-Words
    * ROC curve & AUC
    * Tf-idf
    * Word2Vec
    * CART
    * Random forest
    * ... and much more!

This will mainly serve as a backup folder for my ongoing projects and notes I will be taking from learning new skills related to NLP. More updates to come.

If there are any questions or suggestions for improving this repository, please do not hesitate to contact me at joh15@illinois.edu.


Thank you.
