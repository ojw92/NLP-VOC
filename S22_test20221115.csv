18211	Model Number Question	"

I was looking at the factory unlocked Galaxy S 22 Ultra on Amazon today.   Wanted to check the model number against  AT&T's list of compatible phones. 

The phone being sold on Amazon has the model number â€ŽSM-S908UZGEXAA.   AT&T lists SM-908U and SM-908U1.  What's the meaning of the 'ZGEXAA'?, and would this be compatible on AT&T?"	N	None	10/12/2022 8:51	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

18213	S22 Ultra screen glitch, but only when turned off...	Like the title says, sometimes by freak accident or spontaneously, my S22U glitches it's display, but only when it is turned off. It has almost never happened while it was on. Maybe it has something to do with the tap twice to turn on feature? Or maybe the display settings just like the problem other Ultras are having with a glitched display? Maybe both?	R	:green: Exynos 128GB	10/12/2022 8:51	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
18214	Honestly, I think this phone is bulletproof	Drunk me, the display and cameras survived 3 different crashes (I don't want to use any case) and phone still works as expected. I have insurance but I'll wait for a major break (i.e. display) as I only have 1 free swap. Minor annoyance, back is quite rough on the fingers, maybe I'll consider some wrapping.

18215	The one thing I hate	The only thing I can clearly state that I dislike about the s22 ultra is that the battery SUCKS!!!

18216	Prioritize Which WiFi To Connect To?	Is there any app out there that would allow my phone to prioritize which WiFi it will connect to?  Here's my situation, I run both a 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz network.  If I turn on the WiFi on my phone in a location where the 2.4Ghz network has a stronger signal than the 5Ghz it will connect to the 2.4Ghz network even though the 5Ghz network provides significantly faster speeds.  The reason I have my phone configured for access to both networks is because the 5Ghz doesn't reach a few spots in the house.  Ideally what I want is for the phone to not connect to the 2.4Ghz network if the 5Ghz network is in range even with a weak signal.	N	None	10/12/2022 8:51	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

18221	Late to the party. Just discovered Pro Video mode on the S22 Ultra. Is this one good alternative to Filmic Pro for a crime drama series project I'm shooting? Also...	..I shoot at 24FPS, but I can only set speed to either 45 or 50, instead of 48. Does this mean I'll have to shoot at 60, and then reduce the FPS in post?	N	None	10/12/2022 8:51	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
18222	I want to love this phone. I do not.	"I had the Pixel series from 1-4. Pixel 4's high price and poor support soured me enough to skip the Pixel 5, but the other devices in that generation weren't appealing either. When my Pixel 4 started giving up the ghost about a year ago, I resolved to just get the Pixel 6 and move on. 

Then I saw this shiny delight of a phone with gorgeous animations and a stylus. I research the specs and start having a hard time justifying the P6 over the S22U. Better cameras, faster processor (or at least not the first gen of an in-house processor), stylus for myriad uses, faster charging speeds supported, bigger, better pixel density, etc. etc. On paper, I'd buy the S22U every day of the week over the P6 (and maybe even the P7).

I took the plunge. I regret it. I can't stand this phone.

Setting aside the boxy, sharp corners, my grievances are all about functionality. The camera is slow to respond, heats up the phone (not tons, but some), and chews through battery. 
The UI stutters 7/10 times any animation appears. 
There's no aptX support. 
The app drawer only scrolls sideways instead of vertically like every other android phone (launchers correct this at the cost of performance in my experience on this phone). 
Reception is worse than any other phone I've used. 
The boosted screen brightness in direct sunlight is, admittedly, wildly impressive: I can read articles and look at pictures in broad daylight--wait, no I can't because it starts throttling performance and brightness to reduce heat after about 30 seconds. I'm not playing Pokemon Go with YouTube playing PIP with a hotspot for my tablet all through my double-thick unbreakable case--I am trying to read an article from my Google feed on my afternoon walk with no other apps open (and the lowest screen resolution) and the throttling kicks in. 
No matter how many times I adjust my settings to stop prompting me about allowing Google Photos to edit my photos, the prompts resume every other reset or so.
Oh, and resetting happens 2 out of 3 days. If I don't, this phone decides to stop receiving texts that aren't RCS. To the best of my knowledge and understanding, it's not an issue with the service provider. The messages are getting through to the phone, it just occasionally hides them to surprise me with all of them at once after a reset.

There are more, but these are the issues that occur with the highest frequency for me. 

When it works, it's a great device. The other 70% of the time, it seems like OneUI and Android are tripping over one another. I open my S22U every morning hoping for the best. It feels like pouring a bowl of some cereal that seems lighter on marshmallows than usual--I pour another bowl every day, wondering if all the marshmallows are at the bottom or something. The next day could (should?) be better. After months with the S22U, I don't see better days coming.

18223	How easy is it to get a repair done under warranty?	"Right now I currently have the slightest/most faint burn in (if I could even call it that) and is really only noticeable with full brightness, in a dark room, and while viewing a grey screen. It's mostly the status bar icons (battery, wifi, etc.) as well as notification icons, although if you look very hard, there is a super faint line in the top third of the screen (line is from Youtube in portrait mode I believe).

Anyway, although there is most likely no reason to try and get it replaced now, since I'm sure Samsung and/or uBreakiFix would likely not see any noticeable issues (although I'm a little OCD so if I could get it replaced I would, just don't think they will see the issue or won't think its a problem at its current state), if the issue does get worse then I would like to try and get it repaired under warranty. Since there is a Samsung Authorized Repair center by me (uBreakiFIx), what would the process be to get the screen replaced for free under warranty? Would I just bring it to them and they would be able to fix it the same day, granted there are parts in stock and the burn-in is more noticeable? Or does the phone have to get sent to Samsung first to get ""inspected""? I've heard mixed stories, so just wondering what the process is like if I live near a Samsung Authorized Repair center.

I just moved to Android from iOS and I think there is something wrong with my Galaxy S22 Ultra. The problems I'm having are with Google Assistant and Apple Music. When I'm navigating with Maps, if I use my voice to call up Google Assistant, the maps app would minimize itself and Google Assistant would show up for 1 second then quit. This only happens when I am actively navigating, not when sitting passively with the maps app open. I've tried disabling PiP for maps but then it presents a different problem. Say if I say ""Hey Google, play XYZ from Apple Music, the phone would open Apple Music fullscreen, maybe play the song and would stay on Apple Music instead of returning back to maps.

So now I have another problem. Now Assistant can't even get music to play anymore even when I'm idling. I'll say something like ""play song XYZ"" and the Assistant would attempt to play it but nothing happens. 

I've searched everywhere for a fix and can't find it. I really like this phone but I need to navigate quite often and would have no choice but to go back to an iPhone (I really don't want to) if this can't be solved."	R	None	10/13/2022 13:20	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

I love the s22 ultra but unfortunately switching phones for 2 reasons.

  
Reason #1 my eyes get bloodshot red from using the phone for 30mins +. Yes i have used extra dim+eye care(max) + black mode and it helped lessen damage but still causes damage to my eyes. I have 2-3 new lines RED permanently in my eyes that are a bit painful. I use my computer all day w/ 2 screens and I never experienced such eye strain/fatigue.  


Reason#2: I was on a phone call for 2 hours and i got massive headaches... so i said what the hell and switch 5G in settings to LTE. I tried another call for 3 hours and it was perfect. no headaches, no tiredness nothing. I ran speeds LTE(15mbps) vs 5g(280mbps).



if anyone gets headaches try switching off mobile data (5G) and maybe that'll help (I haven't tested this)...

18292	About to give up (long rant, I know - but I'm hoping for some insight on what I'm missing / doing wrong)	"So I've made the switch to an s22 ultra from Apple about three weeks ago. Because I don't want to be stuck with only what apple allows me to have and only on their terms and prices. Traded in a two years old iPhone 12.   
I'm no one's ""fanboy"" and don't own anyone's stock - I'm rooting for Samsung, but it's been a bad experience.  
Got off to a bad start, I had an old Samsung account before I moved to a different country. I no longer have my old phone number where my MFA goes to on login.   
The only way Samsung accounts were willing to reset my account phone number is to give them the IMEI of my Galaxy S3. I don't know my S3's IMEI. Samsung's support is bad, like REALLY, HORRIBLY BAD when compared to Apples. Sorry, this is the honest to god truth - not just because of them unable to help me but the way they operate and handle me as a customer was bad. Had to open a new email for that and now I've got a separate email account open just for me to have a Samsung account.  
But wait, that was just day one..

* Camera stutters about half the time I try and use it, it gets very good after a few seconds - but I miss the first shot most of the time.
* Google maps always thinks I'm looking sideways (and I twirled the phone a lot for calibration).
* Google maps suggests alternate routes on map, which is nice - but its REALLY confusing while driving on a downtown grid since it draws all of them all at once on every street.
* Android auto looks like its 5 years behind. I know cool walk is coming sometime soon, and should be about where CarPlay has already been for the past couple of years.
* I've got competing apps from Samsung and Google, offering similar stuff, like messages (I can't use the web interface if I'm using Samsung's app, but Google's app looks and feels barebones).
* Emoji's are bad, I don't use them much but they are bad, and why are there two or three different emoji apps pre-installed, that all perform poorly and look like a Chinese copy of something?
* Whenever I connect to android auto, the device performs absolutely terrible for about 2-3 minutes, and after a while when it heats up it acts poorly again? I run it on a mount that's fixed to my AC vent, it gets all the cold air it could possibly need..
* Battery life is 10.5 hours till dead, and that's when I'm home all day and not out in bright sunlight. Unless I turn off half the stuff that sold me on the device in the first place. I don't use it any more or any less then my 2 years old iPhone, I don't play games and I consume most of my media on my laptop since I work from home.
* Widget game is nice, better then Apple's - but not that far off. So's the GoodLock etc.
* Performance is sometimes excellent and at other times not  - I'm talking about the first 5 seconds after unlocking the phone until it ""picks up speed"", after that it's fine.
* Galaxy Buds 2 sit weird, and the above-the-ear-canal design makes them wiggle out of my ear when walking. When I try to adjust them I pause, hang up on someone, deactivate noise cancellation or skip a song. Tried smaller tips and that makes it worse, bigger ones hurt after a few minutes of use.
* The Watch 5 pro is awesome, I love it, but getting rid of Samsung Pay because I prefer google wallet means I'm ""wasting"" a button function. Other then that it's pretty great actually.
* Google assistant routines and Bixby routines are both sparse in comparison to apple shortcuts. Like - embarrassingly sparse, can't even start to compare how bad they are.
* Half of my smart home works with Google home, another third works with Smart things, another two thirds with Alexa. No single solution covers it (Ring, Ecobee, August, Hue, MyQ).

With battery saver on it gives maximum 6hr+ SOT and rarely sometimes it may give 8hr+ SOT with battery saver.

2 days back with battery saver on and with a normal usage of social media apps and chrome (no camera app or games) I got 11hrs of SOT. Check the screenshot -&gt; https://ibb.co/0yxybPk

So the next day I tested it without battery saver from 100% with almost same routine of app usage. The interesting result was it gave 9hr 45min SOT (100% to 9%) Check the screenshot -&gt; https://ibb.co/hfX1Wyj

So for those who just uses social media and other similar apps for a day. It's not really worth it to turn on battery saver. As the loss is just 1hr or 1.5hr SOT.

Yes the s22+ battery has improved overtime with the adaptive battery feature turned on. Kuddos to Samaung for not disappointing and providing a decent battery that could last a day with 10hr SOTðŸ‘

18303	Pixel 7 Pro and S22 Ultra	I have a P6P and am debating between these two phones. I always like changing things up. I like taking pictures and being engrossed in how much detail a certain camera can capture. I know Pixel has always been known for its cameras and I've heard mixed reviews for the S22 Ultra camera. The biggest thing for me, though, is that I like having fun with my phone. It's the reason I moved away from iPhone. I like being able to change app icons, apply themes, use single take in the camera app, and just have outright fun with it. I've had a Pixel 6 and it seems limited in the fun department. Also, at least right now, I much prefer the bigger Galaxy watches as opposed to the small-looking pixel watch. I'm sure Google will continue to upgrade their expanding ecosystem but I guess a fear of mine is going from a minimal upgrade from my current P6P to a P7P only for a P8P to go all out. Am I correct in thinking a S22 Ultra would be a bigger upgrade from my P6P and more future proof than a P7P? My mindset for "future proof" is that Samsung won't drastically change their phones and hardway much from where the S22 Ultra is right now. However, given that Google very recently changed to their homemade Tensor chip and is introducing things to their ecosystem I fear that commiting to their current phones will leave me in the dust in a year or 2 when they introduce and add more to their ecosystem. Essentially I want a phone I can have fun with and keep me entertained until the next big thing, whenever that is. One thing I see myself having loads of fun with is 100x zoom lol.

The other day, it just decided to change from SFC to regular charging without any sort of provocation after plugging it in, and has done it a few times since.

18374	Got a Pixel 7 Pro - Comparison to S22U!	"I get bored easily and Google was offering $700 for my S22 Ultra, which is more than its generally going for currently on Swappa. So I decided to test it out! Here are my thoughts.

* The first noticeable thing is the weight and size. I was expecting similar to S22 Ultra, but the P7P feels immediately way lighter.
* The screen is technically smaller and I notice it. This isn't necessarily bad, but I didn't expect to notice a .1"" difference.
* I don't use cases, and the P7P is impossibly slippery. Even more than the S22U from my use over the last 24 hours. 
* The Pixel does not wirelessly charge very well... At least for me, aligning it on the chargers I have is super difficult. I'll probably get the Pixel stand, because my current options aren't cutting it. These same chargers work perfectly fine for my S22u.
* After 24 hours, I can say the battery life is about the same to my Qualcomm S22. Which is to say, okay but not good or great. I've had every Note or Ultra since/including Note 7, and I've always had poor battery life on Samsung phones. The only phone that can last through the day (and more) for me is my work phone (14 pro max).
* I was worried about cell coverage / signal strength with the Tensor 2. It seems very slightly worse than the S22u, but not bad at all. I live with a pretty decent T-mobile 5g signal so your mileage may vary.
* Either I really like OneUI or I don't like stock Android 13 very much. It's not terrible, but I do miss OneUI. I was still using 4, not the 5 beta.
* Fingerprint sensor on the Pixel 7 Pro is nowhere near as good for me. Registered the same finger multiple times. It's \*fine\*, but slower and more failures than the S22.
* I don't take a lot of pictures.. The Pixel 7's camera system seems nice. I've always preferred Samsung's photos better than anything else though, even compared to my 14 pro max. 
* I have to keep the brightness bar on the Pixel a lot higher than I do on the S22 ultra to maintain what I would call even brightness.
* I'm one of those weird people that likes Vivid display setting on Samsung phones, and I miss it. But the Pixel display is quite nice - no real complaints.
* The edges of the pixel are somehow sharp and sometimes uncomfortable to hold. I think this is something I'll get used to.
* The Tensor 2 is noticeably slower if you compare the phones side by side. Loading apps in particular. However, the difference is small and if you aren't directly comparing them next to each other, the Pixel speed is definitely ""fine"".
* I have to turn up the volume on the Pixel way higher than my S22 to get equal volume to my ears. But, the audio seems fine to me.
* Pixel exclusive feature of call screening is totally underrated. Given the number of spam calls I get, I'm really loving that feature.

18390	What is the S22 Ultra Camera's File nameing meaning or convention	"I would like some techie/computer information regarding my Samsung S22 Ultra.  i am trying to understand its camera photo file naming convention. Two examples of the camera created file names follow;

20220425\_201440.jpg taken on 2022April25 at 8.14pm (the first picture I took during that minute according the file manager)  This is not the time modified nor file creation time, but the time actually taken as stored in the photo meta data.)

20220425\_202551.jpg taken on 2022April25 at 8.25pm (the last picture I took during 8.25pm minute)

I understand the first half is the date; yyyymmdd\_??????.jpg . I assumed at first that the ?????? was also time count. For example, above **201551-201440 =111 difference in count** and they are about 11 minutes apart.  THE TIME DIFFERENCE COULD BE OVER 10.5 MINUTES OR JUST UNDER 11.5 MINUTES. This means the seconds are **between 630 and 690seconds**. If this is a time count then it is between 630/111 = 5.67  seconds per count and 690/111= 6.2 seconds. So MAYBE THE COUNT IS 6 SECONDS OR TENTHS OF MINUTES FROM MIDNIGHT? Testing this hypothesis;

This means the seconds are between 630 and 690seconds. If this is a time count then it is between 630/111 = 5.67  seconds per count and 690/111= 6.2 seconds. So MAYBE THE COUNT IS 6 SECONDS OR TENTHS OF MINUTES? FROM MIDNIGHT? Testing this hypothesis; 814pm is 20hours+14minutes from midnight = 72000seconds +840 seconds = 72840 seconds. This is nowhere the count # of 201440.

I also want to note that my wifi is Wi-Fi 6. I heard the S22 has some problems with this. I only got Wi-Fi 6 in the last month so that might also contribute to why it's been a lot worse.

18423	Samsung should optimize One UI for games	"I recently brought Galaxy S22 and i found out that in the UI there is no touch lag at all its perfect and soo smooth like my finger is glued to the content on screen while i glide it. Its like they went to iOS and copy pasted the iOS touch acurracy on the overall system and i was super happy about that. I also am a previous iPhone 12 user so i noticed that thing right away BUT the thing is, that same touch accuracy or touch tracking whatever u call it can be seen translated to games as well on iOS but on the S22 when i launch a game that insanely accurate ""glued to my finger"" touch experience is gone. It happens only in games .. i play online multiplayer shooter games like Call Of Duty mobile and also as i came from iPhone i noticed this thing right away. I also tried to disable game launcher, i also tried installing game plugins from game launcher and tweaking performance to max and also went and enable ""alternative game performance mode"" which is supposedly disabling GOS of Samsung but nothing worked. This happens only in games unlike iOS where its consistent everywhere.

I think Samsung has done it right in terms of UI and scrolling, navigating and multi touch experience its basically same if not better than iOS now there is zero complains for it.. but now what they should focus on is they should optimize One UI in such a way that also in games we get the same goodies so it feels responsive and smooth to the touch while gaming too. Why only in games the touch lag is seen but nowhere else? Samsung is definitely doing something wrong here. They should tunnel vision on this problem and make it match iOS now. If they do it this will be such a huge thing than they imagine, now Samsung phone would be considered good for gaming as well. If they do that, it wont be any difference than gaming on iPhone and imagine how huge of a improvement or innovation is this for Samsung. 

Also pepple say 8 gen 1 is a hot mess but on my S22 i don't notice is overheating that bad while i was gaming. 

Samsung definitely went right direction with Galaxy S22 but they just need to figure this one thing out which i just talked about. I hope Samsung dev teams or Samsung sees this and understands and makes it better.

I will also install to One UI 5 once it comes on my device and will update here if this thing is fixed on One UI 5 or not, and if it's not fixed it should be on the next updates maybe on One UI 5.1 . 

My god if this ever gets fixed gaming debate will be gone and Samsung would own the world.

18425	S22 Ultra Unlocked S908U1 &amp; 5G on AT&T Prepaid	"I had posted about this about 4-5 months ago and ended up finding out that AT&T's map had been incorrectly updated. They have now formally launched 5G in my area for Prepaid, but I still can't connect. I just got off a long call with prepaid support and their manager. They're telling me that my device isn't on their list of compatible devices. The only troubleshooting they would do is they asked me to check if I have HD Voice on my phone and I can't find it. They say that means that Samsung never pushed out the software that would unlock 5G on my device to make it work with AT&T and they refused to do any other troubleshooting. I have no idea if that is accurate. It seems ridiculous to me that Samsung's greatest and most expensive US model unlocked 5G phone isn't on their compatible list.

18461	Upgraded from Note 9. Three things I miss the most.	"Note 9 user since the release week. IMO the best Samsung phone ever released. But due to use and abuse the battery was more dead than alive and the screen was badly burned in. So I pulled a trigger on S22 Ultra.

General impression is as good as expected. It is the flagship after all. But there are three little things I miss the most.

 \- Light indicator next to the front speaker

I use four different platforms to communicate and some of them have higher priority than others. I could assign individual indicator colours to separate apps to know which one is active without touching the screen.

 \- Rear facing fingerprint scanner.

It was so natural to land my index finger directly on the sensor as you're picking up the phone. By the time it was facing you, the screen was already unlocked. And the sensor had tactile feeling so you knew exactly where to touch. Nothing against underscreen sensor, it's fast and accurate and I'm pretty sure I'll get used to the position really quick but Note 9 had it figured out.

 \- Dedicated Bixby button.

Very controversial because even the hardcore Note 9 community, myself included, used to hate this useless button until Samsung got tired of all the cries and begging and actually made it configurable. And this is where it became the best thing ever because even without side apps you could assign multiple actions to the button. Shame it got removed, but it was our own fault for cursing it so much and not enough time after the update to let everyone know it was the best feature ever.

I use smartphones for animal photography usually (previously p20pro and p30pro ) and I noticed with this phone that it basically cannot run the camera to its full capabilities / shoot in raw / take burst shots etc. It gets hot,the apps freeze, and there's a solid 2 second lag between shots. The shot I take when I press the shutter is not the shot that shows up in the gallery. The phone struggles to focus whether or not I use auto focus and the resulting pictures even in 3:4 108 MP full res are grainy and low detail when cropping or zooming in on photos in the gallery. Shooting in raw is almost out of the question because it just gets hot and stutters even when using the pro raw app. Software is all up to date. I went to the store and they said it has no physical issues and I'm possibly overworking it :/ 

My question is: will the 256gb version be any better or should I go for a different phone with similar capabilities like Google pixel 7 or honor? Huawei isn't avaliable in my country any more. 
I do like the stylus/pen but I won't lie I am kind of discouraged after this experience.  I'm worried I'll have the same issues because I can see after looking online there are camera lag and software issues - and I am expecting a phone that can smoothly run its own software.

18484	Lost S22U S Pen for 2 Week; Had Pen Returned. It is detected by my Phone and Cursor Appears, but Physical Touch Screen Input Does Not Work	"Hey everyone, the title says most. I left my s pen at a gas station an hour away. Luckily I called and they had found it.  They kept it until my brother snagged it and mailed it to me. In the interim I used a Galaxy Tab S8Us Pen with my phone. It works just not as well.

Well I got the s22u s pen back today but no matter what I do I cannot get it have it respond on my touch screen to taps or swipes etc. My fingers and the Tab S8 pen work fine. Below I will list what works and what troubleshooting I have done.

S22U S-Pen Parts That Work:

- Phone detects the pen and knows it it is in or out od the slot.
- S pen isn't 109% battery
- S pen is detected by the screen to some degree because the cursor icon appears when I hover the s pen right above the screen. 
- The button on the pens body works. I can hold it dowm to open an app.

What the pen CANNOT do is simply interact with the touch screen. This renders it 90% useless. 


Troubleshooting Attempted With No Luck:

- Reset S Pen in Advanced Settings
- Attempted to move phone far from Tab S8 pen and toggled thebl allow the use of 2 s pen setting to try to desync the Tab pen; however, it seems to always consistently work again.
- Let s pen charge to 100.
- Restarted my phone with the s pen in and out of the slot. 
- Changed the s pen nib/pointer.
- Removed my case and screen protector,  but the s pen worked fine with then before. 


I really don't want to treset  my phone again. Part of me thinks the tablet pen is to blame.

18504	Considering jumping from S20+ to S22. Only concern is the relatively small battery capacity. What are your experiences?	"I absolutely adored my S20+ for almost three years. The only troubles I've experienced with it is due to it's size; it's too big for me personally. I often couldn't reach the other side of the screen with my tumb while holding it in one hand. Especially with a bumper case (and sometimes popsocket), it becomes an absolute unit.

Now unfortunately I dropped it out of it's case last week and the screen finally broke. It still works but I'm heavily considering the S22 as a replacement. The only thing that troubles me is the relatively small battery capacity (3700mah) compared to that of the S20+ (4500mah iirc). Now I've heard things about it being way more energy sufficient than the S20+ and it will probably use less battery power as it's a smaller model.

I'm an intense phone user, but it's mostly quick browsing and stuff. I barely play any games on it, but I'm stuck to my phone all day browsing and such. I usually have to charge it halfway through the day (it's usually around 30-40% in the early evening. Now I can charge at work, in my car etc. But I just don't want to regret buying the s22 and constantly having to worry about battery life.

It's mostly the size that attracts me to the s22 instead of the s22+. I plan on getting a bumper case for my next phone too and I fear the S22+ will become an ever bigger unit than the phone I have right now with said bumper case.

I love how my pictures turn out when I capture them (not professional, just for social media posting), and was quite impressed with the zoom function which my 12 mini doesn't have. Videos captured though is a different story.

Anyway, as I use my phone's camera mainly to upload on social media, I recently just noticed that my S22 Ultra uploads very blurry photos on FB. I try uploading the same photos using my 12 mini to upload them to FB and they turn out perfectly fine. I tried a workaround which is to upload a bunch of photos (which will be blurry at first). Then once they've been uploaded, I'll reupload the same photos one by one in the same album and erase the blurry ones. Which surprisingly works.

The thing is, that's a bit of a work for something that should have been very simple. Has anyone ever experienced this? Or is there a fix or another work around for blurry facebook uploads?

i just wanted to chime in with my own experience, i have 512gb snapdragon, im using FHD and 60hz cuz i didnt notice any big visual difference at all with WQHD and 120hz, i also use adaptive brightness despite many ppl say it wastes more battery cuz it needs to use the sensor to detect the surrounding brightness, but i dont care, i wanna use it, its convenient, im not gonna make my user experience worse just to make the battery life a bit longer, thats stupid. in the same logic, i also have bluetooth on  all the time, i might consider manually turning this off if i wanted it to last longer, but honestly i have no issue with my current battery life. 

so i bought it on aug 10, started using it aug 12, and after tweaking some settings recently, and with the charging capped to 85%, i find that by the time it gets to 20%, i can usually and pretty consistently get about 6+ hours of SOT, and 17-18 hours of offscreen, most of the SOT are split between instagram and youtube, and i use external speakers too, and usually at loudest volume when its youtube, so, ya, i think this is not bad at all. for the record tho, most of youtube and instagram is done on wifi.

to anybody else having less than desirable battery life, i suggest watching some youtube videos on it, and choose which settings u wanna tweak, but no need to sacrifice the things u really need/want, cuz that defeats the whole purpose of having such a good phone. and then just let the phone learn your usage, give it a few weeks. also keep in mind that there can never be 2 identical phones and usages, so theres no point in always comparing to others who have it longer than you, everybody is different, esp in small detail stuff, like lock screen or home screen, for example i have dynamic lock screen, im sure that eats some battery too, but who cares, i like it. this is sounding very cliche, but i think as long as the battery life is enough for you, and it doesnt negatively impact your day to day use, then why stress urself out?"

As far as the comparison between Pixel and Apple, the same seems to apply as it has always been. Pixel takes better photos and iPhones take better videos. But Samsung is overall the more consistent device. It produces the best of both.

18584	The Samsung Members app said I had 365 days to purchase Samsung Care+ but it was actually 60 days. What do you think?	"I had purchased a Galaxy S22+ during the summer and had planned on absolutely getting Samsung Care+ since I could really use insurance. I had checked the Samsung Members app the after setting up the phone, and it said I had 365 days to purchase it for the phone, I thought maybe that was some sort of promotional thing or something that overridden the 60 days or so I normally had. After the 60 days, I had tried to purchase Samsung Care+ after my screen cracked. 

On the Members app, it took me to the registration page to enter in my IMEI, when I entered it in, it said ""samsung the imei you have entered is not a us imei."" I called Samsung Support and they said that it expired after 60 days. Now I have to like $170 for a screen replacement."	N	None	10/21/2022 14:13	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

"Ive been having S10e almost since launch but recently Ive been struggling with battery (which Im hoping to change before year's over), and also my back glass which recently I broke, however I couldn't find an OEM glass, and after all my storage is also been cracking my head up as I need to clear data almost everyday. 

I'm planning on buying S22 256gb as soon as I have the resources lol, the graphite color on Samsung's webpage is sick, they offer $150USD trade-in for my cracked S10e but I don't know if I can rely on them due to the fear to be declined. 

So, after all this, is the S22 on October 22 still worth it? Or should I seek for other options such as Nothing Phone 1, Pixel 7, etc. The size matters to me, the compact size of my S10e is perfect.

18591	Whitestone Tempered Glass UV Glue Under Screen?	So I have been using Whitestone Dome and AmFilm Ultra Glass both Tempered Glass UV glue on style screen protectors for the last 4 years or so, ever since the S10 or under display fingerprint scanner. These brands always performed near flawlessly for me especially with the accuracy of the fingerprint scanner. However, I usually would need to replace the protector about 4-5 times a year due to dropping the phone and the Tempered glass breaking and protecting the screen underneath. Thankyou lifetime warrantys. I can say I have never broken a screen using a Whitestone or AmFilm Ultra Glass protector. That is the good news. On my S21 last year I noticed what looked like, for lack of a better word a "a shmear line" under the screen that looks like the UV glue is somehow getting into the screen around the edges at the top of the phone and down the sides about 1.5 inches. This leakage intrudes into the screen about 1/4" at the top where it's the worst to about 1/8" at the bottom of the areas at the top of the sides. You can clearly see the leakage  distort the clean consistent look of the dark screen with the screen off and you angling the phone in the light to help see the distortion. When the screen is on it is 100% unnoticeable. I also notice every time I change the screen protector and introduce new liquid UV gel, the distorted area gets bigger, as if it continues to penetrate the screen everytime I use the UV glue. I apologize for the long post but I wonder if anyone else has noticed this? and I wanted to warn anyone that this could happen to them as well. I did not notice it on my S10 or S20 only my S21 and now on my S22. It bums me out because these screen protectors are by far my favorite  tempered glass screen protectors with the in display fingerprint scanner. It just blows my mind how this happens in this way and only at the top? Anyone else run into this?	N	None	10/21/2022 14:13	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

18598	Breaking my Nova Addiction	"It's been so long now I can't remember when it began. It must have been back in the touchwiz days when a friend or someone I thought was a friend introduced me to Nova Launcher. He said check it out it won't hurt and it's free. Being impressionable during that phase of my life and rooting just became a hassle I said sure why not, it can't hurt (the 1st one is always free). After that I found myself paying for Nova Prime and I was hooked. Jonesin' for the next release. Tweaking and tweaking to get it just right. Before I knew it I was a Nova junkie. Every new phone or tablet had Nova installed before anything. Then when the backup feature was introduced I was in too deep. I'd get a new phone, install Nova, restore my backup and I was good to go. I went from my google nexus through multiple Notes all the way to the S22U with no complaints and still have none. 
This week I decided to go to rehab get cleaned up go cold turkey and embrace One UI 4 in preparation for One UI 5 to see if I could survive. Surprisingly I did. I'm not going to lie some adjustments had to be made. A couple resizable widgets are no longer resizable and that app drawer, what the hell. I mean I wish the designer of it would explain what the thought process was. Some things work in custom sort but don't work in alphabetical? puzzling but I'm ok. At least good lock got me scrolling vertically and not horizontally, and now that it does icon packs I'm good. 
So I'm clean now and as all of those who get clean whether it be rehab or a program feel the need to do. I have to stand on my soapbox and preach the virtues of being clean. The one thing I noticed going through this when I would upgrade a phone shortly there after I'd question if it was a smart move. Sure the phone would be faster have a feature here or there but I would quickly come off that new phone high. Maybe that's because for the longest time I've just been putting my old phone into a new phones body (were you really expecting some startling insight? I was a junkie for Christ's sake). My advice let your phone breathe for a few before you restore that Nova backup. 
And just to be clear I know Nova 8 is coming and this has nothing to do with Nova being bought by Branch. My phone just feels  brand new again. But who knows I may have a relapse, require an intervention, that sort of thing. Nova 8 might be like crack and I might take a hit."	N	None	10/24/2022 14:48	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

I have re-installed Spotify, restarted the device, enabled music controls in the Widget app in settings/lock screen. I have removed and re-added Spotify notifications and they still won't show up.   
The only thing I did yesterday was I noticed that a lock screen of some kind came up while I was idle on my phone after 30 seconds while playing a game. I changed that to never lock while playing a game. I don't know what that settings was or even where to find it. But that's the only thing I changed yesterday. Up until then all my media controls were showing on my phone's lock screen.

Im leaving apple currently and in the market for a relatively small phone (coming from 13 mini). So, i hadnt much choice but s22.
What should I expect from its battery? Im mainly using telegram, other social media and 3-4 hours streaming music. On mini I usually charge it twice a day, at morning its 70-100%, i top it a little midday and plug it in at evening. I usually have 4-7 hours SOT with that usage.

After weeks of disappointment in this phone's passive battery drain (specifically overnight) compared to the 5 y.o. OnePlus 5T I was coming from, I have finally discovered the cause by chance. I have tried Bixby routines for disabling mobile data when on wifi, power save + disabling most comms overnight, and a few other things from the numerous posts about this, but nothing made a noteworthy difference. Then yesterday I noticed my LTE signal was quite poor whilst not on WiFi so I changed to 3G and forgot to change back. Lo and behold almost 20h later (18h screen off time) my battery has only dropped 23% down to 77%. This is soooo much better than before: I would get about 50% battery drain overnight - power save on + mobile data/bluetooth/nfc off etc. The key is that even though mobile data was off most of the time through the Bixby routines, VoLTE/LTE was still on and draining my battery whilst struggling with a bad signal. I've now changed by Bixby routine to change to 3G/2G only when known WiFi is connected - hopefully my frustrations are over!!

Initially I wanted to wait until the S23 series to release next year cuz I wanna get a better phone this time but oh wellll. So I asked my bro to give me a few suggestion and now I'm torn.

My own option:

1. S22 Ultra (cuz i got Tab S8+, it make more sense to stick with Samsung?)

The suggestion he gave:

1. Xiaomi 12T Pro
2. Google Pixel 7 Pro
3. iPhone 14 Pro Max

Honestly after owning my current Poco F2 Pro I'm kinda done with xiaomi, I'm bored with it, and the phone is bugging now, so I'm hesitating to get another xiaomi. But it's the cheapest option, so i really dk.

For the Google Pixel 7 Pro, idk the back of the phone just seems ugly and the only color for 256gb is obsidian and its ugly, that's it.

For the iPhone 14 Pro Max, is the most expensive option out of these 4, I've never used Apple, I head that the longevity is really good, but it can be so much hassle switching from Android to iOS (i love torrents lol) and i mean I'm using my Tab S8+ so yeah...

Honestly I just wanna get the S22 Ultra, because I'm feeling comfortable sticking with android and the phone seems pretty solid? (okay idk much about phones).

What surprised me is that Slingshot (Open GL 3) is much higher. First two tests are 95 and 42, whereas before the update it was around 88 and 40. 

Apex Legends is hitting 60 but performance is dropping a bit as new data is loaded/screen moved around really fast.

No issues with my S10- Checked the charging options. I have all 3 options enabled (fast charging, super fast charging, fast wireless charging).What could this be? It seems like the phone is not getting enough power to consider it being able to charge, but then I'd expect the S10 to also not charge. It did always say I was slow charging on my S10, so it would make the most sense. Any way to verify this or to enable the ability to slow charge?Solved!Go to Solution.

18829	As of last week, my  phone won't use wifi network for texts or calls, if airplane mode is enabled.	So I work in a steel building and Verizon service is terrible in there. (ATT works flawlessly in there). My solution to this has always been to turn airplane mode on, and use the wifi network. I turn on airplane mode to force the phone to use wifi, because if I don't, it will insist on using the virtually non-existent Verizon service and not make calls or texts. This has worked beautifully for me since I got my s22 and switched to Verizon in April. Last week this suddenly stopped working. It's like the phone doesn't even recognize that wifi is available for calls or text, but it will use wifi to browse the web or use apps. If I try to send a text it says "searching for connection" and if I try to make a call it says that I can't do that with airplane mode enabled. I will not receive any texts or calls either. The green phone button you press on the keypad screen to make calls doesn't show the wifi bars next to it. But again, if I want to watch a YouTube video I could do that no problem.Wifi calling is enabled. I have tried turning this on and off (while NOT in airplane mode) and have restarted my phone. I have also reset the network settings and this worked for about an hour. I don't believe it's the wifi network at my work because like I said, I can use it for the internet and apps, and I also did a test using my network at home and it does the same thing. I have done all relevant updates on my phone. I asked Verizon and the tech insists this would never work in a metal building if no Verizon service was available, ignoring the fact that that's what wifi calling is for, and that I have been doing it since April and it wont even work at my house where I have good service.

18855	S22 Ultra Camera Module Issue	Let me begin by saying I am well aware of the OIS allowing for some movement and possible "rattling" of the camera. I have had my phone for 6 months. Yesterday, I began to hear a very audible tapping or rattling when even slightly moving my phone around. In fact, you can feel the tiny vibrations from each tap as it moves from side to side. This was definitely new. The only way I could get this to stop was to open the camera and 100x zoom, at which point I have to actually shake the phone to get the rattle. This led me to believe this was simply OIS and I need not worry, even though this had seemingly just began after 6 months. Then I realized as I zoom in within the camera app, around 10x there is a huge jump and stutter to the other camera, and the camera is pointed at a completely different spot. It's as if the 10x camera is not aligning itself with the others. I'm just curious is anyone else has experienced this and if so what the actual problem is?

18903	Please help me get a decision	" 

Hello guys and thanks if you stopped to see my post.

I have a really hard time trying to decide between what phone i should get between the Iphone 13 and the Samsung S22 Plus.

I use my phone for simple games, such as Clash Royale, but sometimes i also enjoy playing power draining games, such as Genshin Impact.

I\`ve had a Huawei P30 Lite for 3 years now and it was quite amazing. Battery life still good even though i didn\`t change the battery, nice photos for the time, but the biggest downfall was performance and, honestly, the speakers are very poorly made and also the screen.

I love to upload photos on my Whatsapp status or Instagram story, and i would love that the phone that u guys recomend me between Iphone 13 or Samsung s22 Plus will help me get the best quality in that kind of social media posts.

\+That is very important for me to have smoothness while using the phone. Even though i guess both of them have it, since they are both last generation phones, i would still like one that i can use quick actions and still feel smooth.

I care a lot about the design, but honestly i love it on both phones. I use my phone about 3-4 hours on like school days and stuff but in weekends i sometimes use it like 4-5 hours, but since my day starts at 7:00 AM and finishes at 11:30 PM, i would like that my phone should need only night charging in order to keep me the hole day.

If you have any other questions about how I would use the phone or stuff, dont hesitate to ask!  
Please help me get the decision quickly cause i want to get it in maximum 1 week.

Cheers and thanks a lot!"	N	None	10/26/2022 14:01	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

Once you do this, you can record new videos and attach them to whatsapp.Any old videos that you have taken before you made the reset on the camera app will not upload to Whatsapp. You will see a difference when you are trying to upload the video file, the old affected file turns almost pixelated and dark. Once you reset your camera app, make new recordings and when you try and upload the new video, its much clearer and not pixelated.

About a month ago, while I was using my phone it suddenly froze up completely non responsive to touch or button press. It then restarted by itself. After that it seemed to perform as normal for about 2 weeks when the same thing happened again. Fast forward to now. This keeps happening more and more frequently. I have lots of available storage and the freezing does not seem to be associated with any particular app as it happens both while I am actively using the phone and even when it is not in active use. I notice it is restarting only because it disconnects from my Galaxy Watch which causes it to vibrate alerting me that something is happening. The phone does not feel warm and it does not have any damage. I have a screen protector and a defender case on the phone. I charge the phone with a wireless charger mainly, but use a USB charger in my car when driving. I cannot determine what will cause the freeze and restart as it seems to be random. 

Can anyone tell me if this is a known issue or any fix available? This is a Canadian version Ultra and my current software version is

I've recently upgraded(was gifted) my malfunctioning phone to this guy. Ordered a Spigen Liquid Air as a placeholder. Not crazy about the looks of it.

I'm trying to decide between three different cases. I've always had flat screened phones so always just went with TPU and a good tempered screen protector. *Biggest concern* being protecting the curved glass and grip with one handed operation. I drop my phone maybe once or twice a year on smooth or wood floors, 3 to maybe 4 ft accidents. TPU has nice grip on clammy hands.

I'd prefer not to add crazy bulk or have it look like a weekend biker's device like the OB Defender or Commuter or UAG Monarch. Port cover would also bother me.

* UAG Civilian - Looks really good and protective. Not crazy about the orange trim, but may learn to live with it. Pictures make it look super slick plastic finish. Little bit Halo-esque almost like early Chief or an ODST.. lol

* OtterBox Symmetry - Looks bleh, looks somewhat protective, cheap enough on a sale. Looks like slick plastic.

* Dbrand Grip - Looks fantastic with interchangeable skins. Completely hides phone color. Looks decently protective on corners and fairly grippy textured edges? Can't tell if there's adequate lip to protect the screen. 

I will be pairing this with either a WS Dome or amfilm. Just can't imagine any film protectors feeling or looking right.

I appreciate any and all suggestions in advance!"	N	None	10/27/2022 9:21	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE
18970	If you are having issues with poor cellular reception and battery drain. Try the Wi-Fi calling + Flight mode combination.	"  

My workplace has poor cellular reception, I have to put my phone in flight mode to stop my battery draining. However, I wonâ€™t receive phone calls or text messages by doing this.

I discovered a useful tip from another user on a comment section. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS22/comments/yd40e3/comment/itqk76u/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS22/comments/yd40e3/comment/itqk76u/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) 

You can use Wi-Fi calling while in flight mode, as Wi-Fi calling will allow you to receive phone calls and text messages without cellular reception. 

I tried it today and it made a massive difference. Now I can receive phone calls without my battery draining due to poor reception, as my workplace has reliable Wi-Fi. 

I set up a Work and Home Bixby routine for this:  

**IF**

Start manually

Start manually when start button or widget is tapped


**Then**

Flight mode

On

Wait before next action

00:30

Wi-Fi

On

The widget for this Routine will appear on the Home Screen

Open notification panel and turn on WIFI calling (**Wi-Fi calling is not available on Bixby routines)**

**(If you try and turn on Flight mode and WIFI at the same time using Bixby routines, Flight mode will automatically disable Wi-Fi, thatâ€™s why I added a 30 second delay)**"	N	None	10/27/2022 9:21	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

So I have the exynos version and to be honest this phone doesn't really seem worth the price. Matter of fact it's lagging worse than my previous phone (s10).
I will name a few:

When I record a video on insta, it starts getting really choppy towards the middle of the recording. The video itself is fine, it's just that I see it as super laggy.

Sometimes youtube/youtube music is incredibly laggy. I press the search icon, for example, and it literally takes 5 seconds for it to open. Then when I tap on the video, it is also super choppy and unwatchable. 

Sometimes when my phone is plugged to my car it has a hard time functioning normally.

After taking a photo it takes like 3s before I can take another

I think that sometimes my phone just doesn't vibrate when receiving a notifs. When it's in my pocket I legit do not feel anything.

Sometimes snapchat (ik..) filters just don't load and I get the pink and black squares

Most of these things are fixed by a restart, but it's awkward to be doing that every few days like I have some barely alive s8. I technically have the best samsung can offer, and it's honestly a bit upsetting.

My Galaxy S22 appears to have no way to set that within Chrome.

19012	Galaxy S22 Ultra (Locked) Not Receiving Software Updates	"Hi - I have an S22 Ultra I got last month when I joined Verizon. It's network locked to Verizon.

When I initially got the phone I saw that it was several updates behind (it was on the July security patch in September) but doing the manual 'Software Update' through settings on the phone told me I was up to date. 

I had to plug my phone into my computer and use Smart Switch by Samsung to force the update. It immediately recognized my phone was behind on updates and pushed through the Verizon updates.

Just this week Verizon announced the One UI 5/Android 13 update for their S22 phones and on the S22 subreddits nearly all Verizon users are reporting they've received it. I still don't have the update. I've search probably 100 times using the 'Software Update' button but it keeps telling me my phone is up to date when it's not. 

I also have tried using Smart Switch and it's not showing any updates even though it confirms I'm still on Android 12/October 1 security patch. 

Has any one else encountered issues with Samsung phones not updating/not receiving update pushes from Verizon? Anything I can try to get it to start updating?

19031	IMEI for S22 Ultra Purchased from Samsung.com not a US IMEI	Ongoing issue. Originally when I ordered the phone, I requested the Samsung Care, but an online agent said she had to redo my cart, and I did not notice it was not added back to the order. Now when I try to add Samsung care I get the message "The IMEI you have entered is not an US IMEI." This is an unlocked phone that I am using on T-Mobile.I contacted Samsung support back in August. I was given a ticket number and told it would take 3-4 weeks to resolve. It was not resolved. I contacted them again this past week and was told it would take 24 hours to correct, it's been 3 days and the issue is still not resolved.Also, while I was going through my phone settings this week, the warranty section said it needed additional information and when I clicked on it it asked for my purchase date and order info, then it said my warranty was under review. When I looked today, it said it was rejected. The phone no longer said it was registered under my products, but when I tried to register, said it was already registered. Later it appeared on the product page again as registered, but the information in my phone still says it was rejected. I entered the date it was delivered on in April as the purchase date, since that was the date the product page said the warranty was good until for the next year, and took a screenshot of the order page and number so I don't know why it would have been rejected, if that is even the case.I had originally registered through the phone when I set it up, but when it was not listed under my products, I think the agent may have re registered it or done something to cause it to appear under my products back in August.I just want to be able to add the Samsung care to get coverage for my phone. I have damage under the screen. The Samsung support agent said it would be covered by warranty and referred me to Best Buy. Best Buy said they don't do warranty repairs and UBreakIFix said it wouldn't be a warranty issue and even if it was they can't help me under warranty until the IMEI issue is fixed. At this point I'm about to pay out of pocket for the repair at Best Buy, but I still want to be able to add the Samsung Care in case I have future issues. This is my first Samsung phone, all my previous phones have been blackberries or Palm/HP webOs phones. The agents have been courteous but has not been a good experience thus far.

My S22 ultra suddenly stopped charging on its default charger. When i went to bed it was okay and out of the blue it stopped charging. I'm using the 25w power adapter and its default usb c cable. Sometimes it works but it only charges on 'cable charging ' instead of super fast charging. 

So i tried a different set of chargers, i used my galaxy s8 charger and *poof, it charges but not fast charging, but it works. I tried my friend's s20 fast charger and it doesn't work. My guess is the normal chargers works but the fast chargers doesn't which is really weirrrdddd. 

I tried my original charger again but this time with other devices, in my earbuds it only charges for a couple of min and then stops again, but in my VAPE it charges smoothly. 

There is no water detected in my phone for the past few days which is really weirddd. 

 I've already booted my phone onto safe mode last night and out of nowherre the moisture detected comes out and then i restarted my phone then disappears, tried my charger again and it's still not working.

Already done reset on my phone, still not working.

If it's water damaged how come my old charger works tho. Phone's still on 7mos can my phone and service provider replace it? 
Thanks in advance guys, have a good day!

19129	Would you upgrade to the S22U - Samsung Week?	"Hello.

So it's Samsung week and some good deals are on, I guess before the expected Black Friday deals.

I currently have the S21U 256gb, owned since release. One UI 5 beta and running perfectly tbh. No phone contract. Just use a sim-only plan with Smarty which is Â£7 per month.

The S22U in sky blue is tempting. I know upgrades are marginal really.

Samsung Phones unfortunately depreciate fast. Now I have no doubt I could use this phone for another 2-3 years with no issue, but it would be worth minimal value against phones that are now consistently coming out Â£1300 odd in the UK. 

Samsung are currently offering Â£590 trade-in against the S22U with a few add-ons like 12 months of Disney plus for free (I currently pay for).

For comparison:
Pixel 7 Pro - Google offers Â£275 trade-in for the S21U
Apple iPhone 14 - Â£50 and a note to recycle sensibly (which was funny). 
Vodafone - generic Â£150 off any. 

The S22U would cost around Â£18pm after trade-in with Samsung, which I think is a great deal. 

To put it into perceptive, it costs Â£5-Â£60 on a phone contract with the likes of EE or 02 for 36 months.

I rebooted my phone, she called, and it came through fine. Next day I get another random VM without my phone ever having rang or saying I missed a call. Rebooted and it's working again.

19161	AT&T Visual Voicemail Issues	"TL;DR version:
Visual voicemail issues for the past year. Carrier suggesting I switch to iPhone to eliminate the Android platform for troubleshooting. Looking to see if anyone else has experienced the issues in the detailed post below. 
Full post:
For close to a YEAR now, I've had multiple issues with visual voicemail. I will either get a notice that there is a new message (voicemail icon in the notification area), but the message isn't in the visual voicemail app. The other scenario is I have a new message notification and it's in visual voicemail, but when I try to access the message I get ""please wait while message is downloaded."" It never does download despite being in several different places over the course of several days or being on or off WiFi. 
Through troubleshooting, AT&T has either openly stated that they have removed my voicemail from the account and re-added it or they have ""refreshed everything"" from their end. Either way, I'm up to 5 times now that I have lost all my messages in the visual voicemail. They tell me to go to the voicemail settings and reset the voicemail password. They tell me that after they did their ""refresh."" I never did that, but then just before they signed off for the night, they told me to press and hold 1 to reset the password..... I already knew that this calls the voicemail. I don't know if there's a menu option to reset the password, but if you press and hold 1 it calls voicemail and you have to enter a password before you even get to the menus. 
I've been using Android for a very long time (I think since FroYo) and have never had any issues until now. I've been with AT&T for about five years. This voicemail issue first started in Nov. 2021 with the S21 Ultra. After various failed troubleshooting efforts, AT&T allowed me to change phones to the S22 Ultra to eliminate the problem of the phone. 
All was good with the S22 Ultra, but eventually the voicemail issue returned. A couple more ""refreshes"" later followed by AT&T support suggesting I do a factory reset (that would then be six times of losing my messages). Now it is being suggested to switch to the iPhone so that now the platform is eliminated as the problem. The more I think about this, I don't think this is going to work out. Unless AT&T is willing to provide me with a charger, screen protector, a case, and potentially the equivalent of Android Auto Wireless adapter for the iPhone; there is just too much involved with a change to iPhone at this point. 
I've forwarded my issues to the AT&T office of the president. It seems like maybe they are beginning to correlate my report with other similar reports (I posted on their forums and someone on Verizon with an S20 reported having voicemail issues) and they claim they are working with Samsung on fixing this. I contacted Samsung but they claim to have no knowledge of this and refer me back to the carrier.  
I had a ""stuck"" voicemail (message not dowloading to listen to). I changed the SIM card and that fixed the problem.

I have tried restarting the phone, setting the USB settings to the Android Auto option , clearing the data and cache on Android Auto app, making sure there wasn't an Android Auto update in the play store. 

I plug my phone into the usb port - and at one point I would get a message in my notifications saying ""Android Auto is Connecting"" but it never moves any further from that.   
Now after I have done a bunch of steps like clearing the android auto data and cache and things, when I plug my phone in, I don't get anything related to Android Auto in my notifications , just a USB Settings notification that when I tap on it, already shows set for Android Auto.

When I go into my Phones Settings, and then search for Android Auto its back to its default state , it says Android Auto will start when my phone is plugged into the car - I plug my phone into the car, and nothing happens it doesn't get detected, I just get the USB options in my notifications.

19192	A quick look at the new Astrophotography mode in the latest Expert RAW for OneUI 5 (mainly from the perspective of GCAM)	"I was very skeptical of the new Astrophotography mode in the latest Expert RAW - and the look of the tiny video Samsung has selected to demo the feature and also the numerous crashes reported by redditors were not encouraging.

I will need to start the post with a not-so-small side-note - Astrophotography is a very, very wide term going from extraordinary nice art-like pictures like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/comments/xe529t/14minute_time_exposure_star_trails_from_the_iss/) going all the way to the fully scientific extreme of the pictures taken by Hubble to JWST. Somewhere in between there is a place for pictures that look good enough so as to be able to instantly recognize what you see in the sky vs. what you see in the picture with the added bonus of an improved view in the pictures. My absolute best (personal) example for that is [Neowise comet + big dipper + Polaris - taken with GCAM on PocoF1 in a Bortle 3-4 zone](https://i.imgur.com/Q9GthFN.jpg) - side-note - a simple test if any astro photo containing the big dipper is decent is if you see Mizar and Alcor as [different stars](https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-science/mizar-alcor-plough-double-star/) (which somebody with a good eyesight in good observation conditions should also be able to see directly); on top of that star colors are probably more realistic if Dubhe (a red giant) looks more reddish than for instance Merak (those two are ""the pointers"" since they point to Polaris in the Northern sky).

While my picture above was taken in a place with very good stargazing conditions ( about 3-4 on [the Bortle scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bortle_scale)) my tests with S22U so far have been only in my backyard around Bortle 8, so I expect that when I will find the time and energy to travel almost an hour to my better stargazing site the S22U images to also get clearly better.

But even like that the first tests look promising - [here is a photo taken with the main lens for 11 minutes](https://i.imgur.com/or9XvAa.jpg), and [here is a capture from the open-source Sky Map program](https://i.imgur.com/1i0rDPR.jpg) set in Time Travel to the time and direction of the S22U picture - the 3 green dots to the right of Mirach are M31, M32 and M110 which unfortunately the program has labeled one over the other. M31 is better known as the Andromeda galaxy and if you look in the S22U picture you can actually see it as a very faint diffuse object - so indeed initial Astro mode for Samsung is about at the same level as initial Google Camera (see in [this video](https://youtu.be/zu8W3rXcNfg) around the 19 minutes mark their Andromeda image - but taken in a much better location that mine last night).

The location of my backyard makes impossible to get a clean picture of the big dipper so that will have to wait for that stargazing trip.

On the S22U you can also use Astro mode on the other lenses - on the 3x zoom it also looks somehow promising but on the 10x it seems to never be able to finish taking an image.

So is Astrophotography mode in the latest Expert RAW all OK? Actually not 100% so - crashes have to be fixed (and apparently some will be soon according to a post in a Samsung forum) but also IMHO somebody should keep an eye on the visible [vignetting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vignetting). Also a form of quick preview (where a preliminary picture is shown after 30s or so) should be added (just so that you can quickly confirm that the phone is well oriented instead of waiting 11 minutes for nothing).

However it is important that now Google is no longer alone in this Astrophotography race, things will definitely get better with more competition, and I am super-curious if Apple could actually jump well in front of both Google and Samsung by using their sensor-shift features for very, very, very long exposure times (average exposure time for both Google and Samsung in Astro mode seems to be under 4-8s to avoid forming star trails but shifting the sensor could easily increase that 4-8 times; OR we could buy a [star tracker](https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/best-star-tracker), then a lot of DSLR super-expensive stuff and finally get a [composite picture like this](https://slate.com/technology/2014/01/moon-and-andromeda-relative-size-in-the-sky.html)).

I bought a brand new S22 ultra yesterday, and since then I've seen some issues that I can't seem to fix, and I'd really need your help :

1. There is no way to enable facial unlock or any biometrics, when I press on Biometrics and security, I don't even have the section for configuring any of those two. It's not greyed out or anything, it's just non-existant.
2. My system is somehow taking 453 gb and it seems to keep taking more and more space ? I only have about 50 gb left, and my apps and everything only take around 10 gb. How the hell is that possible and what can I do about it ?
3. I have enabled Developper mode, but I still can't find anywhere the advanced settings (like to remap the side key and make it stop enabling Google assistant or Bixby) or even the developper options
4. I'm trying to find the ""Suspend execution for cached apps"" thing, but it's not showing anywhere.

I'm feeling like I bought a baby mode phone, why do I lack crucial features ?

Here are my infos :

Software version : PU\_S319L\_XT\_V0.0.5

If I take a mirror picture or a picture of any humans with the 1x, their bodies are always distorted because of the lens, and they are always unsatisfied because they just dont look like that, me included 

Many pictures that I take which are not fully lit are going to be filled with grain, the night photos are just a pure challenge for the camera. If I use the night mode, it usually cant focus correctly even if I use night mode in scenarios which have some light and where the camera could focus easily. Night shots photos are so oversmoothed and have no textures or anything

Almost every single photo will turn out to be over exposed and with a slight green tint to it, usually too warm, lacking sharpness or detail, during daylight. During nighttime its always a heavy contrast with high highlights and with the greenish tint and warmth

Videos are just too grainy many times and I hate that we cant use steady mode in 4k in 2022 flagship phone, making me get shaky videos in 4k60

This was all for the 1x, but every other lens has their own issues, to be honest the 3x lens is the only lens I have been enjoying but I cant use that lens in every single scenario. I literally need to edit every single photo so it can look decent, its just a joke man

19217	Pixel 7 Pro review (after one week)	"So, before the pitchforks come out, here me out...



This is for whoever's thinking about trying the Pixel 7/7 Pro. I hope people can be open minded and not be in a walled garden for any one company. It's sometimes best to know what's out there to make an informed decision. That being said...



This review obviously isn't comprehensive, nor is it complete. It's simply my thoughts on the Pixel 7 Pro having used it for a week (and perhaps that'd be more apt than ""review). Some caveats to add: It's a brand new phone. Everything, in theory, is working at its absolute best. I'm comparing it against the S22u and I am well aware these phones are in two different categories in terms of pricing and how they are viewed in terms of their respective hierarchies.



Also to note: I've owned many of the modern flagships in the past few years, ranging from the 6 Pro, S21U, 13 Pro Max, Note 20 Ultra, 12 Pro Max, Pixel 5, etc etc.



My initial thoughts:

\- I can't appreciate enough how light it feels in the hand. It has a nice uniformity to it, and it's not as awkward to hold as the S22U, nor as girthy as the Pro Max series. This doubles when you consider it's offering relatively the same height and basically design metrics as those two. You also wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the 6 Pro and 7 Pro if you flipped them on their fronts.

\- Design is great. When I first saw the renders, I have to be honest and say I wasn't too much of a fan of either the 7, or how the 6 looked. The 4-5 design was OK. I do miss the two-toned days of the older Pixel's, though (My favorite). However, it's been growing on me. Especially after seeing it in person. (Ya know, for the 5 seconds before I put a case and lens protector on it). I'll make a quick note and suggest that you do look into getting a case since they say the back camera bar is far more prone to scratches than its predecessor.

\- Fantastic display. I'd certainly say it's up there with the S22U - absolutely gorgeous and crisp (on QHD). It definitely gets a lot brighter than its predecessors, which is saying a lot, because a problem I personally had with the Pixel line up was that it didn't offer nearly good enough brightness as the competitors. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great, either. I feel the 7 puts it in line with where modern smartphones should be, and then some. Almost forgot to mention this, but the haptic feedback isn't bad at all. iPhone's rendition is superior, but I can't complain, here.

Quality is clear and nice. I should note that I've seen a complaint on forums stating how users are experiencing yellowish-tint and washed out colors on their 7/7 Pro's. I haven't experienced this, or maybe my eyes aren't that great at discerning it. YMMV.

\- Speakers aren't bad. It's loud, and if I'm not mistaken, perhaps louder than the S22U, but certainly not as 'full' sounding. I don't have an issue with it, and I typically use my earphones anyways. But good speaker and sound quality, nonetheless. I haven't tuned it, nor care to. But I'm sure that's an option if you should choose.

\- Battery isn't bad. When I bought the 6 Pro, I had bought it used and the battery drain was noticeable. I don't know how this will fair in the next month or so, but for now it gets me through a day, comfortably, with moderate usage (Youtube, social media, Google maps, no gaming...) I got about 5 hrs of screen on time from 100-to-20% with the above usage. If my math is correct, that would make it 6+ if I ran it to zero. (QHD, 60% brightness) - which is in line with what I was getting on my used S22U.

\- I will admit I haven't used the camera extensively, although I'm very much familiar with both the Pixel and Samsung's methods of photography. This doesn't matter all that much, because the 7 Pro largely borrows from the 6 Pro in a lot of ways, with maybe a few iterative updates/upgrades. This extends to the selife camera, which looks virtually no different then how it did on the 6 Pro. The viewfinder looks really grainy in low light (and I know most phones do, but it's REALLY noticeable on the 6/7 Pro) and decent during the daytime. The pictures are meh, at best. The sharpness and quality that Pixel's were known for in their older models is not here. And in all honestly, it's almost as if it has regressed - in my OPINION. I still say S22U is EASILY the standout phone when it comes to selfies, holding that title since the S21U, of both the Pixel AND Pro Max series. The selfies look low quality. At least if you're comparing it to other modern flagships. Not as sharp.



\- Front cameras are great, as always. Again, I haven't had a chance to really explore with portrait shots and other environment snaps, but for the pictures I have taken, they've come out pretty good. For the record, I'm not one of those reviewers like the Tech channels that are taking pictures and then blowing them up to see every nuanced hair follicle to discern whether or not one takes better quality pictures over the other. I very much take most pictures at face value. And you'd be hard pressed to find differences in most flagship phones, unless we're talking each respective companies computational takes on different exposures and environments. In which case, if you know your phones, it's really no different here. But I will admit, after having taking many many pictures with different phones over the few years. I'd say the older Pixel's (think 2-3) had the lead in this category (say for the botched portrait shots some photos had with the single lens shooter) then iPhone was a close second, and easily the most consistent. Now, S22U takes this category. I feel it's the most well rounded in terms of stills and its camera suite. However, as the reviewers put it, the Pixel does capture more details in most instances. FWIW, 95% of viewing my photos on my phone, so it's not a big deal to me.



\- Video. Almost forgot to mention this. The video on this thing is great. I'd say the camera quality is sharper than the S22U's video. The degree of view from the primary camera seems slightly larger, too, in comparison, although I may be imagining this. I'm gonna have to look at the specs to verify. Aside from that, it's great. Haven't done much shooting with video yet, but if the 6 Pro is anything to go by, it's in the conversation with phones outputting the best video quality. 



\- Performance is great. I've yet to come across a stutter or lag, but time will tell. Apps are snappy upon opening and closing, and the navigating the UI is buttery smooth. This has carried on from the Pixel 6 Pro. In my experience, it's more smoother than the S22U, but do note it's a matter of opinion and experience. When I had the 6 Pro beside my S22U, the S22U lag was noticeable. However, it became a non-issue during my usage and I'd say the S22 is pretty damn snappy in its own right. I know many people want to know about the fingerprint reader and I gotta say it's been damn impressive. Aside from maybe two times where it didn't work and of the two times, I had to tap to wake up and then push again, I have no complaints. It's super fast, and on par with the S22U at the time of writing this. The face unlock, however, is noticeably not as quick as the S22U or the iPhone. S22U being the fastest, and the iPhone being the best and most consistent.



\- Features. If you're familiar with the features of the 6 Pro, then the features here should come as no surprise. They're awesome. Magic eraser works fantastically (but I will say Samsung's version is also fantastic). Call screening is great for those that get stupid robo calls or scammer calls, often. Hold For Me is a delight to have. A few calls I had during this week were made that much easier due to this feature.



If I had to nitpick about anything, it's that Samsung's keyboard's learning algorithm's worked better for me than GBoard - specifically with adding to the dictionary or learning my usage patterns. Samsung's keyboard would pick it up and suggest words I'd often use within a few sessions where as with Google, I've had it add, and then forget, words I use often, or outright not suggest it to me, at all. And it's learning algorithm to suggest words takes longer - in my experience - than Samsung's. HOWEVER, again - in my experience - GBoard is far more accurate at determining which keys I hit than Samsung's keyboard.



Takeaways for comparison sake (My OPNION)



\- S22U has the better design (minimalist look, less intrusive camera set up, less scratch prone)

\- Pixel more ergonomically friendlier in the hand, and lighter.

\- S22U destroys the selfie camera on the 7 Pro

\- S22U takes better portraits, is better for zoom, and offersmore flexibility with its camera options. the 7 Pro is more crisper/sharper - and in most cases - truer to life.

\- S22U does a better job at multitasking

\- Pixel's UI feels more snappier

\- S22U's speakers more ""fuller"" sounding, Pixel's more louder.

\-  Both phones have fantastic displays, but the S22U gets brighter (both get plenty bright, though!)

\- Face unlock is faster on the S22U

\- Fingerprint unlock is about the same in terms of accuracy

\- Battery life about the same (Brand new Pixel 7 Pro vs used S22U)

\- Features offered and how you like them is entirely dependent on your use case

\- Keyboard more accurate on Gboard, but better learning algorithms/suggestions on Samsung (at time of writing)

Do you have any permissions enabled? I just checked mine, and I have zero enabled, but the app functions still without issues. Not that any of those permissions would impact sound notifications. 

Strange. Google search is full of iOS users complaining about no sound. 

So with as many S22U users we have in this thread I'd bet tons of you use the Amazon app in some capacity and I'm wondering if you hear sound/vibrations when you receive your notifications from Amazon ? And if so, what permissions, if any , are enabled ?

The wall charger that fast charged this phone just two days ago (which still fast charges other devices) now when connected charges so slowly that if I'm using the phone while it's charging it will actually drain the battery slowly and not charge it.  Also now a cute little notification pops up to ""use the charger and cable which came with your device"" very cute considering the phone DID NOT come with a charger.  

My only way to interpret this is that there was a software update to literally punish non oem chargers. Now as I said this charger fast charged this device less than 72 hours ago and is currently fast charging other devices.  The charger and cable are not the issue.  My understanding based on the new EU laws that forced Apple to drop the lightning port is that this kind of pety manipulation would be illegal.

For the past several months, I've had the following issues with launchers:

* OneUI 4.1 ""crashes"" when returning to the home screen. It will blink and revert to the main home screen regardless of where I left it and be either non-responsive or aggressively return when I try to do *anything*, for 5~10 seconds. This is an eternity when trying to silence an alert or turn off the playing media because something else needs your attention NOW
* Nova v7 will periodically go completely unresponsive requiring a device reboot. This happens several times a month, sometimes several times a week.
* Microsoft Launcher does not sync Notifications properly resulting in mixed-status and missed items.

What I do like about both Nova and MS launchers that OneUI does not allow for natively is a vertical scrolling App Drawer. The rest of the feature sets are basically a wash, and I have the two set visually about the same as the native OneUI anyway. Being able to create multiple pages for the dock and leaving it blank is kinda neat, so I can clear the screen of all icons and just have the wallpaper showing, but still have my shortcuts and widgets on other home screen and dock pages.

Boy was I disappointed, I feel samsung really dropped the ball this year. 
In my opinion, the S22U does not really compete with other flagship out there. I mean except the screen and design, it does not win in any other categories. 
For instance, the battery is subpar. It barely lasts me 8 hours SOT with medium to heavy use. I know it's not Samsungs fault, but it isn't mine either. I paid Samsung to make sure they provide me with a phone that I can rely on. I don't pay Qualcomm. So its really on Samsung.
The vibration motor, I know it's a small thing but why did they change it to something worse. If they couldn't make it better, they should've just left it alone. 
Camera isn't the best either, like previous models could compete with iphones but this year not even that. Except for portrait, everything else isn't that good. Also, using camera for a few minutes heats up the phone so there's that.

Also, when then trying to change volume the volume level bounces randomly, but without sound.Turning off bluetooth makes the sound return.It's like bluetooth thinks the call is ongoing and won't play audio or adjust the volume until you turn off bluetooth after every call. This issue is fully repeatable. Just make or receive a call connected to any Bluetooth device, after the call completed you will not have sound on the phone until you turn off bluetooth.Issue persisted after factory reset.This started immediately after update to android 13.S22 Ultra Verizon Android 13Edit: Upon further investigation, I only have to turn off and on the ability for the bluetooth device to handle calls for sound to return to normal.

You will need to drop your resolution to FHD+ (2316 x 1080).Go to SETTINGS, then to DISPLAY, click on SCREEN RESOLUTION and select FHD+ (2316 x 1080).I have noticed in the past that some apps will not work in the WQHD+ setting. Plus the lower resolution helps battery life. Just sayin'Hopefully, Samsung provides a resolution API fix to the Expert RAW app soon.Enjoy Astrophotography.Leave a comment.

The case fits the phone like a glove. No wiggling of the sides. The case has a good in-hand feel though i expected a bit more of grip especially on the sides. The swarm skin looks good (imo). I wish I had ordered a couple of more skins as back up but may order them later. Btw, without the skin the case is a bit more slippery as the place where the skin goes on is quite slick (it's similar to how the Rhinoshield Solid Suit for the OP6t feels in hand, which I also have). That said, the swarm skin is also a bit slippery but not much.

All in all, I do like the case. This is now the third case for the S22U - the other two being the UAG PLYO and the Samsung Clear Case with the kickstand (the tougher one)."	N	None	11/1/2022 14:49	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

"Being a long time Samsung user and having certain perks I got the Z Fold 4 for $379.99 with the trade in of my S22 Ultra. My S22 ultra is white with 256GB 12GB RAM. Fold 4 has 512GB with 12 GB RAM as well. But what I am concerned here is the durability of the fold. I done lot of research and heard lot of horror stories/statements from the previous fold users that they had cracked inner screen or needed to replace the inner plastic protector each 4-5 months. Fold being such an expensive phone I am confused (if my fold 4 cracks) that it is not worth the headache to keep on changing it. In the mean time, S22 ultra with One UI 5, it is super smooth and a such a durable phone. But getting fold 4 just under $400 and being a revolutionary gadget I am literally confused if I should give the S22 ultra for the trade in or keep it and return the Fold 4. I have used fold 4 now for almost 2 weeks and still can't decide.

I literally need help with the decision because my mind is already messed up at this point. Your insights would actually help me.

Will the Z Fold 4 hold up for at least 2/3 years? Is S22 ultra the best of the two? Should I wait for the Z Fold 5 or S23 Ultra? Just some queries on my mind."	N	None	11/2/2022 12:25	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

19578	Brand new S22 Ultra(Exynos 8GB RAM / 128GB Storage) for $800 - worth it?	"Hi, guys.

So, as the title says, I'd love to hear your opinions on whether the Exynos S22 Ultra is worth $800(brand new 8GB/128GB version).

I've heard very mixed opinions on the Exynos version of the S22 Ultra and I'm a bit nervous. Some say they love it, and it's a smooth experience, others say they hate it, that it's very stuttery and laggy.

I'll be switching from an iPhone 11 with 77% battery health which I have to charge 2 or 3 times a day, so I think that it's gonna be an upgrade regardless(especially in the screen department). My first upgrade thought was an iPhone 14 Pro but that phone is $1270 converted in my country which I believe is way too much and I also kinda miss Android a bit.

I also love the versatility that the S22 Ultra's cameras seem to have(with the 3x and 10x zooms) and I'm also not afraid to dive into RAW photography and camera settings to get more out of the camera. What's more, I almost never game on my phone, so the weaker GPU shouldn't be much of a problem.

Now, I don't expect it to be as smooth as iOS(I've had an S9+ before so I'm familiar with Android and especially Samsung Galaxy phones), but I also don't expect it to hang doing basic tasks like browsing Reddit, Instagram, Tik Tok, or taking pictures.

So I guess what I'm asking is - are you guys encountering major issues with your Exynos S22 Ultras, or is this situation blown way out of proportion? Thanks in advance :)

TLDR: Exynos S22 Ultra - worth 800$? Also, what's your experience with the Exynos S22 Ultra regarding stutters and lagging during basic tasks(such as Reddit, Instagram, taking pictures etc)?"	N	None	11/3/2022 8:56	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Right now at home with wifi on, it will fluctuate between 2-3 bars. The second I turn off wifi, it gives me the No Service icon and only a reboot fixes it.

I've tried 2 sim cards, an esim, factory reset, and even diagnostics at Best Buy. No one is able to figure it out, even though they can recreate it.

Right above the system storage, you'll see the row that says ""apps"" on the far right of it theres a little I in a circle.

Tap that to allow access to apps, so it can see how many there are and how much space they are using. I'd I had to guess that's why system is so high, since it can't properly catagorize apps. Just a hunch, but worth a shot.

Benchmarks I will continuously update on for those interested since this is a big topic.

Battery: s22 ultra I could at least get a day out of. Weekends I could get 2 days of battery. Iâ€™m typically not a heavy user unless Iâ€™m really bored lol.

Camera: love the S22 camera. Really no complaints. Interested to see how it compares to the 4. The 100x zoom is nice, but itâ€™s just a show piece.

Daily Usability: I find that I tend to have to stretch my hand (I have fairly big hands too) to try and get to certain points on my s22. So far the little increase in screen size on my 4 makes a huge difference than the 3. 

I will update throughout the next week or 2 as the battery settles and I use it more daily. If thereâ€™s anything specific you would like to know, please ask. I can compare the 2 on an average persons level as Iâ€™m not a heavy user that does YouTube and all that. Just trying to help those on the fence as I am too. Thanks!"

Very surprised to say the main camera on the Flip4 is better than the S22 Ultra. Don't get me wrong, the S22 Ultras 108mp mode does give excellent detail in ideal light, but apart from that the Flip4 was actually better in every other situation i tested.

Low light was the biggest difference. Where the S22 Ultra would give noisy &amp; slightly blurred/soft portraits in less than ideal lighting, the Flip4 keot everything sharp and detailed.

Outside of that main sensor, the S22 Ultra is better across the board. Better ultrawide with AF for macro. A 3x lens which is superb for portraits (again, when lighting is good). The 10x is unmatched to any phone.

All in all, the main sensor is thebone you will use 80% of the time, so must say i am dissappointed with the S22 Ultra but pleasantly surprised by the Flip4!"	N	None	11/3/2022 17:33	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

19648	Considering S22 Ultra 256/12gb on Contract UK.	"Do you think the s23 ultra will be more expensive than s22 ultra is currently available for? 

So I've been due an upgrade for 5-6 months now and currently with EE.  Unfortunatly all their contract deals seem to be so much more expensive than other network providers now so will probably switch to Vodafone.  Everytime I've considered a phone it's either been too expensive or doesn't have the features I want to tempt me away from p30 pro which I've been happy with. 

  I can't justify spending Â£1000 or more on a phone out right which is why I normally get a contract and pay it over a 2 year period.  Currently s22 ultra is available with Vodafone for Â£130 one off payment and Â£38 a month or Â£170 one off payment and Â£36 a month for the 256/12gb version.

I considered the Honor magic 4 Pro but the lack of ongoing support has put me off and seen quiet a lot of complaints with the software experience and not being great at low light photography(probably the mode I would most want).

I really don't want to be spending more than Â£36 a month on contract and my mate will buy my p30 pro off me so the one off Â£170 doesn't bother me so much.

Am I right to think when the s23 ultra comes out it will be more expensive on Contract than I can currently get the s22 ultra for?  I'm not really interested in paying more than Â£200 one off payment and Â£36 a month. 

I'm assuming when the s22 ultra came out it was more expensive with a contract deal than it is currently?  Any UK contract users I would appreciate your thoughts or an idea of what you paid if you got the s22 ultra when it was released?

My thoughts are the s23 ultra is likely to be more like Â£45 a month at least when it gets released and I really don't want to be spending that much.

Just feels silly that I'm currently overdue an upgrade and paying Â£32 a month still and don't want to tie myself to EE any longer especially with how expensive their new contract deals are.

Both handsets can connect to the wifi signal, but within a couple of minutes, both handsets say ""connected without internet"".Â  Both handsets have ""auto reconnect"" toggled on but neither auto reconnect.Â  To re-establish the wifi connection, both handsets need to be toggled in and out of airplane mode.Â  Buth then several minutes later, both handsets are ""connected without internet"" again.

This is very frustrating.Â  We have a plethora of other devices attached wirelessly to the router, and all are behaving normally and maintaining good connections.Â  We also have other smart phones, including a Note 20 Ultra maintaining a good wireless connection.Â  Only our S22 Ultras are affected.

We have done the following to try and troubleshoot the problem:

1. Reset the router and ensure that it's firmware is fully up to date.Â Â 

2. Reset the network on each headset within settings

3. I have factory reset my handset.

19667	S22+ to S22 Ultra	"Does anyone know if there's a simple way to move from my S22+ to an S22 Ultra or should I just wait until the S23 ultra comes out?  
Unfortunately you can't trade in an S22+ for an Ultra on Samsung's website. I also have the Tab S8, Galaxy watch 5 financed so my credit limit is pretty much maxed out.  
About the only way that I can think of would be to sell it, pay it off and then buy the Ultra. So I guess it would be most cost effective to wait for the 23.  
If it weren't for the slow charging speeds on the Pixel 7 Pro, I'd switch to that.  
I also appreciate having the Tab S8 to watch videos and play games on, as well as occasionally reading books. So I can't see myself selling it. I'm really trying to stick with my S22 plus, but can't help but wonder about other phones and if they would run smoother. I guess it's Fomo. I even contemplated switching to iOS for a little bit and keeping my Tab S8 for my Android fix. I don't have the luxury of being able to have both an Android phone and an iPhone. With me having a Watch 5, it would be useless with an iPhone.  
I mean my S22+ does everything I need or want it to do I just wonder about switching to a different phone sometimes. I know I can't be the only who thinks this way.

After around 9 seconds the call will automatically drop and I will get a ""no network message"" and then the phone will log into the network, but the issue remains.

The issue can only be resolved after a reboot and randomly appears again at some point. I don't see a pattern here. Airplane mode doesn't help. Wifi calls has also no effect .

19690	Battery drain issue combined with charging issue after Android 13 update	"I have a double whammy situation with my s22 ultra after the android 13 update.   
My battery life has been cut drastically by about 60%. Currently I am losing about 40% of charge in one hour of use.  Phone stays warm through the day.  Only browsing the web and playing YouTube Music.  As you can see with the screenshot the predicted battery life is ridiculously off from reality.  
Also my phone won't charge nearly as fast as before. Regular fast chargers can't even keep up with the phone. It actually discharges while plugged in.  I have to use super fast chargers to keep it charged.  
I know the charge rate was reduced for all the chargers (not just excessive phone power use) because I have one of those digital charging cables on one charger that shows the charge rate in watts.  It used to show 22 watts on a super fast charger. Now it shows only 9 watts on the same charger.  Once in a while I'll see it briefly bump to 15 watts but mostly at 9 and never at 22 where it used to be.  
So I have both a massive battery drain problem in addition to the charge rate being cut drastically. All in all it makes the phone almost unusable. It constantly needs to be plugged in to be used.

- do video players center image when playing full screen? Equidistant from the top and bottom of phone regardless of notch?
- can I hide installed apps from the app store?
-most important can I download files from the internet like comics and videos and save it in a folder system?

like if you have an emergency and you have to call the ambulance, police, etc. it tells you if you have signal to do that so if you are camping or something you know to move to a spot with signal if you don't have it at your current location to make an emergency call.

Ohh nice got it. Thanks

First I would like to thank you all for sharing your thoughts and experiences to my topic. 

Currently I have note 10 plus since the release date coming from note 8 as well.

My note back cover cracks yesterday and battery needs to be replaced, more over the s pen battery also dead and air gesture.

Now looking for a new phone. 

I like the note line and using Android since 2012. But my main complaint about Android phones is life time about 2/3 years maximum and after that no support or updates even no more accessories. 

Thinking to shift to IOS 13/14 pro max.

But the support that I need from you is what I'm going to loose if I did this shift. 

I started counting down what is advantage and disadvantages of both, but still can't decide. 

I know this is wrong place to the question as you all will suggest to continue with S22U.

If you can share your honest opinion will be appreciated. 

Thanks

19765	Another post about improving the s22's battery life	"TLDR - I am content with the s22's battery after 1) setting up Bixby Routines and 2) putting apps to sleep and deep sleep.  The rest of this post explains why I didn't go beyond those 2 changes.  

I got the standard s22 (snapdragon) at the end of August.  Since then, I've spent an inordinate amount of time playing around with the phone's settings  (way more time, imo, than any sane person would willing to commit).  I wanted my phone to be able to last until the end of the day, but I didn't want to make excessive compromises on performance.  Here are the changes I made to get my phone to reliably have 4.5+ SOT (mostly reddit, chrome, and YouTube) and approximately 15 hours of total battery:

1)  Bixby Routines

\- If Wi-Fi is on --&gt;  motion smoothness is set to *adaptive* (up to 120hz), mobile data is off, and location is off

\- If Wi-Fi is off --&gt;  motion smoothness is set to *standard* (60hz),  mobile data is on, and location is on.  

2)  Putting apps to sleep and deep sleep

\-Most apps were put to deep sleep, particularly apps I rarely used (if ever) and apps that didn't need to run in the background (e.g., calculator, chrome, Netflix, and games)

\-A handful of apps were put to sleep.  These apps include Reddit, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Discord, and banking/credit-card apps.  I didn't mind get delayed notifications from these apps.

\-I made sure the following apps were not put to sleep or deep sleep: message+, email apps, voice mail, weather app, google, and google maps.  

Based on my experience, the s22 has good battery life if 5g is turned off.  I was easily getting 6 hours of SOT for YouTube and Reddit when the phone was connected to Wi-Fi.  In fact, SOT was generally closer to 7 hours and sometimes went up to 8.  However, the phone was getting just over 3 hours SOT when it wasn't connected to Wi-Fi, and the overall battery life was around 8 hours.  Verizon doesn't let me disable 5g without turning off mobile data altogether, so I figured I would try to compensate for the power drain (reducing motion smoothness to 60hz) and minimize unnecessary use of 5g (putting apps to sleep and deep sleep).

Enabling data saver may help too.  I turned it on for 1 day before turning it back off.  Battery life seemed marginally better, but some of my apps weren't working properly.  Didn't really feel like putting in the effort to make data saver work because I was pretty content with my phone at that point.  

I'm sure I can change other settings to further improve battery life.  Enabling ""suspend execution of cached apps"" seems to have worked for a lot of people, but  I didn't really notice any changes to performance or battery life.  I'd rather keep the phone's default settings if it's at all possible.  After factory resetting my phone more times than I can count, I found that changing a setting is more likely to disable an important function, rather than improve battery life in any significant way.   From what I can tell, there are only so many ways to work around the s22's relatively small battery.

 I used to have this problem with the S21 Ultra, it went away with the S22, but it seems to be back.

I have found since the update to the stable Android 13 (I was on the beta and this was not a problem) that most (but not all of the time), if I switch from one eSIM to another eSIM from a different carrier already stored on the phone the phone does a forced reboot. This doesn't seem to happen when going between T-mobile eSIMs, but only when switching from one carrier to another. Also, the switch which used to take about 10 seconds now involves well over a minute of wheel spinning before forcing the reboot.

Just to be clear - I'm not talking about switching the primary SIM from physical to eSIM, I'm talking about turning on a different eSIM rom the SIM Manager menu.

Just as with the S21, the reboot seems to serve no purpose, it happens after the successful turning on of the eSIM.

19804	My bad experience with an S22 Ultra	"Iâ€™ll post this hopefully without being crucified. Really just want your thoughts on this. 

Iâ€™m an apple fanboy, Iâ€™ll admit it. Iâ€™ve had iPhones ever since the iPhone 4 (with a short period with a Huawei p9). But this year I really needed a new phone. I donâ€™t upgrade regularly, and let my phone die on me before getting something new. 

Iâ€™d seen some great reviews of the s22 ultra, and wanted to try out android (and wanted a USB C charger). So I bought it after thinking hard, especially as it was more expensive than a new iPhone pro. 

And other than missing a few features from iOS, I actually quite liked it. Wasnâ€™t perfect, it felt clunky but thatâ€™s most likely a case of not being used to it. 

Where it started to break for me, was after it continuously crashed, lagged, froze etc. it started out by just lagging when moving between apps fast, or writing too fast. Then it started crashing if I pushed it too hard (using multiple apps). What made me decide to return it was that it often just froze for 5-10 minutes at a time.

Iâ€™m not sure if this is common, or if I was absurdly unlucky, but it really put me off Samsung (and in extension android).

It doesn't happen after every airplane journey but only on certain routes.I'd also like for Samsung to review this and get back.P.S. - The phone was in perfect working condition before the flight (in ear and speaker).

Notification button is greyed out. When I try to toggle it on, it 'seems to work' but when I go back, the button is greyed out again.

The samsung website does but it's unlocked.

19870	Phone acting very bizarre overnight	"So I am not fortunate enough to have the new Android 13 update yet (Canada, Rogers) but as of yesterday morning, my phone is acting very bizarre. 

I went to tap to pay for something and my ""wallet"" app reverted back to 'google pay,' and when opened, it would immediately crash.

I also could no longer use the Samsung internet app, it also crashed on opening.

Everything is freezing, despite attempts to close apps that aren't being used and to clean ""junk files"" out. Sometimes I get the pop up ""App XYZ is not responding, do you want to wait or close,"" sometimes not.

I've noticed if I swipe my finger near the fingerprint sensor while the phone is in use, screen is on, in a certain way, my phone locks itself (maybe this is a feature I don't know about?)

It also restarted twice on it's own. I can no longer search for apps in the search bar to quickly find them, it's like they don't exist. 

Nothing had been downloaded or installed from when my phone was working to the point where things were crashing. It's like I woke up to a new phone. Restarting the phone works for a bit til it starts acting up again.

Thankfully, wallet and internet seem to have figured themselves out.

19872	An example of what's been happening	"Getting error [Android.Process.Media](https://Android.Process.Media) Has Stopped. It happens whenever I take a picture.

From now on, when I say I search, I mean I'm at Settings and search from there. And if I've gone down a level (or more), I'll start the search from wherever I am and if it doesn't work, I back up a level and try again.

Restart phone. OK.

 Go to ""Setting&gt; Applications&gt; Manage Applications and find Google Services framework. 

Don't have Applications. Go to Apps. Supposed to find Manage Applications. Doesn't have that or anything else that looks like it. I have seen it before but not since UI 5. Maybe not on this phone. 

Now I start guessing.

The next step is find Google Services framework. Search from Settings doesn't find it. Go to my PC and search there but gave up. Next is Google Play. Found that. Supposed to tap on it to clear cache. Tap where? It's a whole list of items. Nothing about a cache.

I'll take some of the blame but not all of it. There is no naming consistency between phones and versions and I had much better luck with my first Ultra. I have found absolutely nothing working with this one. The reason I blamed UI 5 was because I didn't start doing anything until it was installed. I was working on ad blocking. Turned some Samsung things off - don't ask me what, I don't know anymore. I know Samsung is important but I don't use any Samsung apps and the directions said I could turn some things off if I didn't use those apps. I totally followed those directions. Didn't turn off too much because then UI 5 happened.

I've been dumped into something that is way over my head. I did not learn as I went. I had Android 6 on the Note 4 and now we're at 12. I've never had UI. This is all new and very frustrating. I've bookmarked many items to read to start at the beginning but I don't have the time. 

I'm not totally stupid. I was certified in QA Automation and taught myself that. Also self-taught in some programming and was going to be promoted to lead but the guy in charge wasn't into promoting women. Then the department got moved to India and I was lead for that. But with this phone, I'm learning calculus when I haven't learned how to add.

As allways I directly installed it.

Well now iÂ´m having much problems with my phone.

First of all, before the update i allways got like screen freezes very often in some apps.  
For example if i use GMaps and try to type directly into the search bar it freezes for a few seconds, than goes back to normal and freezes again if I move the map.  
Same happens if i use the google Search bar or apps like ""Ebaykleinanzeigen"" and if i use a external link from Facebook to the FB Browser, the whole site freezes from time to time.  
And i have this problems since i got it at release day but could live with that, even if itÂ´s anyoing sometimes.

So now i have greater Problems.

I have a Code and the biometric method to unlock my phone and while biometric is active, it freezes while i press the function button to see my display and place my finger on it which means if i put my finger on it, it does not recognize it and goes back to standby in black screen.  
So now if i deactivate biometric method it works like a charm with swiping and entering my code.

But thatÂ´s just the tip of the iceberg.

Now allmost every damn app keeps freezing.

\- Google Play

\- Ebay (Ebay even turns all words in the app to cryptic ones or blanks out funktion buttons after the freeze)

\- banking apps

19903	Be careful with water resistance new S22 Ultra 'damaged by rain'	"Hey all just a warning for you

My new S 22 Ultra (about 3 months old) has had to go for repair due to 'water damage', despite never being submerged in water. Basically it just wasn't charging properly

On having a chat with the technician apparently this is because they think a small amount of rain water may have entered the charging port, and has already began to corrode it, despite the phone being water resistant and apparently can withstand submerging.

They're fixing it under warranty, but not really happy that a 3 month old phone already needs repairing from day-to-day use tbh. I'll probably sell it on for an iPhone.

Just wanted to give a warning that your S 22's may not be as a water resistant as you think, literally mine is being blamed on ""using it in the rain"", so just be extra careful and consider a case that fully seals it, if you want to go out when it's drizzling i guess."

I rarely charge the watch at night, though this seems to happen, and as randomly, whether or not the watch is charging.

19970	Start of audio recordings cut off	I've had this phone for 4 months and have experienced this problem the whole time. When playing a podcast, if someone pauses for more than about a second, then when they start speaking again, the phone cuts off the start of their sentence. You might miss three or four words which is incredibly frustrating. It happens using multiple apps. It occurs when you're using a bluetooth device (earbuds, speaker, car audio...), or if you're plugged directly into the USB C port, but does not happen if you're playing the podcast directly out of the phone speaker. I have tried changing multiple battery settings (power saving settings, adaptive battery, processing speed) without solving the issue. This never happened with my S7 or S10 using the same apps. It seems like if the audio signal drops to zero for long enough (about 2 seconds) then the phone assumes it's stopped, so shuts down its transmission, then when the audio recording gets to the next word, the phone is slow to react in turning the transmission back on. I've obviously had several Galaxys. I probably listen to 4-6 hours of podcasts a day, and so this is a major issue with my phone. The troubleshooting service was useless, and their only suggestion is to hand it into a service centre for multiple days to get a technician to look at it. Is anyone else experiencing the same issue?

Bought a brand new Ultra phone and suddenly I realized I have a sound like the screen is jumping/popping right where the fingerprint area is. It is very annoying as it can pop when I active the phone with my fingerprint or press it slightly harder in that area. The best way I can describe this is if like the screen is glued underneath but not glued well/completely in fingerprint area and so you push the screen harder in that area the screen glues back and then pops back up (It is not visible, you just hear it as a light click sound). I dont wanna believe or return my phone but it really scares me. I never experienced it before with any phone and it really annoys me. Really looks lije a defect or unglued screen (from what I could find online).
Also, I wanna mention that sometimes its gone and even when I try to do the popping sound by pushing it just doesnt do it, which strengths my theory about the unglued area of the screen.

Please if anyone has any information about that or experienced that before with a samsung or any other phone before pls pls tell me what to do and if it is ok. should I return the phone?

UPDATE: fixed it by taking my finger nail along the cutout area where the hidden speaker is near the top of the phone.  Also completely powered it off and then back on.  Previously just a restart of the phone did not work so I don't know if it was cleaning it with my fingernail or a full power off which did it but something worked.

20021	N20U/S21U/S22U	"Hello all. I recently got an S21 Ultra from Ebay refurbished for 600. I got the factory unlocked, 256gb, Phantom Black variant. It's a fantastic device, looked brand new and even comes with a one year warranty. I'm coming from the Note 10 plus so this is a pretty big upgrade for me honestly. A huge downer for me though is the lack of expandable memory as I take tons of pics of my kid. My SD card has at least 7000 pictures on it alone. Everything else is fantastic.

That always brings me back to the Note 20 Ultra, which is another good device. Would it be worth it over the S21U? I have tried it out before and though good, I personally think the screen, camera, the rounded design and the ability to use 120hz refresh rate at 1080 or 1440 is so much better with the S21U. Longer support and battery life is better too. So far the S21U lasts me all day. I do like the S pen, which I can use on the S21U, but having to have it inside the device is not a must for me.

That brings me to the S22U. Evidently Best Buy will give me 900 towards the S22U with trade of the S21U. That's insane. So given I paid 600 and would be getting 900 for it, its like making money on my device. But, I have heard so many bad things about the battery life and that the speakers are garbage. After having both a Note 9 and Note 10 plus, I'm kind of tired of the Note boxy design. Makes the phone wider and more uncomfortable to use onehanded IMO. 

I will probably stick with my S21U as it fits all my needs, but I was just curious if anyone else has any other varying opinions."	N	None	11/9/2022 10:40	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

I am wondering.. Should I possibly look into this? I'm really happy with my S21 Ultra though, especially with the price I paid for it. I don't have to have the latest and greatest, it's just 900 towards a device is a really awesome deal, especially if the S22U was on sale say for around 1000-1100. My S21 Ultra does everything I need though, and has optional S pen support and I like the rounded corners as opposed to the S22U's boxy, Note-like design.

20143	Ford Sync and Android 13	I have a vehicle with Ford Sync, since the Android 13 update my phone does not properly auto connect to the Sync system. On the radio, it shows a Bluetooth connection. If I receive a phone call it always shows up as an unknown number, when I answer I can talk for about a minute and all of a sudden the sound cuts out, the radio starts playing again and on the phone it still says I have a Bluetooth connection. I have to switch to the speaker or the phone to continue the call. Or, it will read there's a connection on the screen, and I get a call and it won't do anything at all. Then I have to spend about 30 minutes disconnecting and reconnecting the Bluetooth to the Sync system until it actually works, and then again for only about a minute before it cuts out and does the above mentioned. Again, all after the Android 13 update. Samsung wants me to detail to them and possibly record what happens.	R	None	11/11/2022 11:24	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

20163	CAMERA RESOLUTION & ASPECT RATIO SETTINGS	I've been trying to figure this issue out for awhile now since I got my Samsung Galaxy S22 earlier this year. How come they got rid of the HDR setting in the settings menu? I And, wouldn't it be a significant improvement if they could make it so the screen aspect ratio and resolution were actually separate settings for the main camera. Perhaps the camera settings, modes, and options should be completely redesigned, so you can actually figure out what camera lens is actually being used.And, I feel that Samsung should completely re-engineer the picture aspect ratio options and the camera resolution options.And, also ALL picture aspect modes and resolution settings should be available on the main camera 1.I'm thinking that they should change those camera modes on the bottom of the camera display to HD camera 1, SD camera 2, HD video camera, and front selfie camera.Pro mode should be available on Camera 1 and on the video camera.This would be a significant improvement for the Samsung Galaxy S22, S22 Plus, & S22 Ultra. This would greatly improve the camera.As for HDR, you can find this setting in the Camera Assistant app in the Galaxy Store. I don't know why this option disappeared from the camera settings in the first place.Another thing that comes to mind is why can't the video calling actually be completely compatible with all Android and Apple and Microsoft windows devices by having universal video calling software which will actually connect to all devices.

As I love the serie ""Person of Interest"" and found an After Effects Project file on the internet with the UI of the Machine, I decided to use this universe to make my call screen. I set some flags here and there (a two-tone green one for the answer button, a two-tone red one for the reject button and a colored one for the caller picture, which color will be set regarding the person it is (family, friend, clients, pro, unknown etc...)) and put some videos from Pixabay in background as CCTV examples with a customized CCTV effect (tuto found on YouTube).

There is only one problem with this video : the call screen changes a little when answered ! There's a little zoom-in effect wich totally breaks the alignment of the Machine UI with the call UI buttons !

My question is, does someone here knows how to edit the way the call UI changes on answered calls ?

20205	Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra light performance mode (from Fold 4)	"Review of the S22U light performance mode and battery

I've recently tried the hack that enables the light performance mode from the Fold 4's on the S22 Ultra. I've noticed a LOT less heating and idk if its me but the phone kind of feels a bit smoother too (maybe placebo effect). Speaking about the battery life, it has improved significantly specially while using the camera. The camera used to just chew through battery before the hack. Haven't noticed any longer processing times also for the images. Standy drain is still an issue tho. Only airplane mode seems to fix it. I used to end the day with around 15% battery left before the hack. I now get a consistent 25%+ and 30%+ if i use airplane mode when the mobile signal is poor. The phone seems to drain 1% per 30mins when the signal is poor.

Overall I would highly recommend the hack as its almost free battery life for no noticeable performance loss. You don't even have to enable it everytime you reboot. There is a separate command to disable it.

For those of you who would like to try it, here's some commands to enter in ADB

To enable Light Performance mode:

 adb shell settings put global sem\_low\_heat\_mode 1 

To verify whether it has been enabled:

 adb shell settings get global sem\_low\_heat\_mode 

If you get the output at 1, then light performance mode has been successfully enabled

To disable light performance mode:

 adb shell settings put global sem\_low\_heat\_mode 0 

To verify whether it has been disabled:

 adb shell settings get global sem\_low\_heat\_mode 

 If you get the output as 0, then the Light Mode has been disabled."	N	None	11/14/2022 9:18	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

I blocked a contact a few weeks ago, subsequently I removed them from the block list weeks ago. However, for some reason, the device is still blocking all calls from this contact even though they clearly are not on the block list.

I blocked and unblocked this contact while on OneUI 4.1, have since upgraded to OneUI 5(I assumed it would fix this bug lol) This seems like a coding bug to me, does anyone know a way to fix this?

I tried

1. Deleting all numbers from block
2. Re-block and unblock
3. Delete all storage data from contacts and phone dialer apps

The only solution left I can think of is to Perform a factory reset.

Anyone else experience this issue and have any advice?

20248	Wireless Charging with Magnetic Phone mount on case (wireless coil position)	"I am wondering if anyone can help me with a problem. I used to use a clamp style phone holder in my truck to hold my phone while driving, it was a vent mount similar to the Kenu Airframe. The S22 Ultra with a defender case on it, is too wide to be held in this set up.

What I want to go with, is a magnetic holder, that has a metal plate attached to the outside of the case, which is held by a very strong magnet holder in the car.

I previously tried this set up with a phone with a bad result. The holder, mount and plate all functioned perfectly, however I also use wireless charging almost all the time, except in my car where I use a cable. What I discovered quite painfully on my previous phone is, the wireless charger heated up the metal plate on the phone to a point that when I picked up the phone the first morning after installing the metal plate that it was so hot it actually burned my hand. Not terribly badly as I dropped the phone right away.

Does anyone here have a magnetic mount on their phone positioned so it does not get heated by the charging coil? If so where did you mount it.

Alternatively is there a better mount that is not gigantic (I have seen some clown looking huge holders) that will securely hold my phone in the Otterbox Defender?

And to be clear, I do not want to be taking my phone in and out of my case daily when I want to charge it. I know this is an option but not one I would do. My phone sits on my desk or bedside table on the charger and I use it for calls / texts often.

I've been using my S20U for almost 2 years now and tbh I am satisfied with its performance except for the camera. I want to get S22 for its cameras but quite hesitant due to the lower screen resolution and battery capacity of S22 compared to S20U. 

I bought my S20U on sale for only $660 2 years ago and its trade in value now is around $206. Since there is an additional discount for trade-ins in my location, I would have to pay for only $404 to get the base S22 and I'd also get Galaxy Buds2 and a 10,000 mah battery pack (not the wireless one) as freebies.

1. My battery is behaving weirdly on the s22+, i mean coming off a 3 years worn out battery, i expected a relatively strong battery, and the s22+somehow does that but it is still a bit underwhelming for a flagship phone, but the one time i decide to let the battery drain all the way it dropped from 8% to 0 in literally just one short game of codm, turning off in the middle of the game which is very strange, i somehow feel my oppo phone was more optimized when i was first using it and it never did things like this when it was new, i fear to think how my s22 will behave 3 years down the road.
2. Regarding OTG support, s22+ for some reason cant edit NTFS thumbdrives, when other devices from oppo and realme could do so easily with no issues. Huge dealbreaker for me since i use thumbdrives often.
3. My oppo phone had this feature that allowed it to turn on by itself for alarms and turn itself off or on automatically based on the time, not a huge issue but why cant samsung do this too?



Would appreciate if someone could explain why these 3 issues exist in the s22 series and lastly regarding one ui 5 can anyone tell me if there was any battery optimization improvements made on the software side just for curiosity, thanks."

First  off I want to acknowledge that there are a fair few ""s22 or s23"" post  here but those mainly seem to be from people who have lasted 5 years  with their current phone. I feel like my case is a different enough and  doesn't answer my question.

With  that said, here's my case. I've recently dropped my Pixel 4A and a  friend loaned me their One Plus 6. I've always thought the S22U was a  great looking phone and wanted it since launch but the price was too  high. Currently the S22U is on sale and has a cashback on it that lowers  the price to 989 euro for the 512GB model. This is the lowest it has  ever been by far and poses a saving of around 460 euro against the  launch price.

However,  I am aware that the S23U is about 3 months out, this poses somewhat of a  dilemma. From what I could gather the S23U will ditch the Exynos chip  and go Snapdragon here in the EU. This should improve battery life and  lower heating issues but I don't know to what degree. The second  improvement I could gather was the camera getting a 200MP sensor. I'm  not a huge picture taker so this improvement isn't a big deal to me. The  two phones will keep the same design and the 23 might have minor  improvements here and there.

Now;  I'm torn between getting this ""cheap"" phone that'll be ""out of date"" in  3 months and paying 460 euro more and waiting 3 months but getting a  phone that might be better. The phone I'm currently using is very usable  but just misses the mark on comfortably usable. I would love to hear  your input.

20334	Need to improve the features in Camera	Hello Samsung,ðŸ‘‹Hi One UI 5 development team, I appreciate the interesting features in the Camera app, and I have the following suggestions:ðŸ‘‡Firstly, I want to lower the ISO as low as possible, but it wouldn't allow it, it's only as low as 50 on every lens. Meanwhile, the Wide lens can reach the lowest at 20, the Tele lens is 25, and the Ultra-Wide lens is 50. That's why I had to tweak the Exposure Value to get the ISO right as I wanted, this makes me feel that this "Pro" feature is no longer Pro.ðŸ¤”Secondly,(currently it only has NTSC standard, 30fps and 60fps, so...) I want to have an additional PAL option so that it is more suitable for countries that use this video format standard, for example in Vietnam, here we use 25fps and 50fps.ðŸ˜„ Besides, it is also related to Shutter Speed, I need 1/25s and 1/50s, maybe even lower so that users can be creative, like 1/2s for example, this will be interesting much more flavorful! Also, when shooting at 24fps - Cinematic, I need shutter speeds of 1/24s and 1/48s, whereas the development team only allows 1/30s, 1/45s and 1/50s.ðŸ˜‚ I really don't understand what they're thinking, you're just doing it without any understanding of video technology and specialized knowledge of camera equipment.ðŸ¤— Another small but also very annoying thing while recording is that when the battery level drops to 15%, the flash that I was on suddenly turns off, which makes me not have enough light to continue recording. So, could you lower this battery level to 5% to turn off the light or remove this limit, and I also want to adjust the flash intensity from 1 to 5.ðŸ˜ŠFinally, Hyperlapse should have 8K or higher resolution, not just UHD or FHD as usual, because it takes a certain amount of time (about a few seconds) to capture a frame. This makes me feel that the software is not taking advantage of the full potential of the hardware.ðŸ™‚Thanks Samsung.ðŸ‘	N	None	11/14/2022 9:19	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

It's not that the option to pick a new wallpaper and customize widgets from your lock screen is so novel - what reminds me of iOS 16 is Samsung's design choices. Both the Wallpaper and Clock style pick menus now strongly resemble those on iOS 16 and iPhone 14 when it comes to function and design - fonts and colors	N	None	11/14/2022 9:19	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

20354	Just got the S22U for $135	"Best Buy was doing a crazy deal where you can trade in an S21U for $900 for Samsung phones, and then yesterday the S22U went $200 off (possibly US only). And the way the $900 trade in deal worked was that they gave a discount for $500 and then the other $400 was put on a gift card which you could use right then, so I only had to pay tax on $500 instead of the full retail price. The stars aligned and got the 128gb model for $135 ($99 plus tax).

Honestly only got it to trade in for the S23U since the S21U was perfect and the S22U isn't much better to make it worth upgrading (or downgrading in terms of speakers lol). Figuring the difference in trade in value between the S22U and S21U would be at least a hundred, it'll be cheaper in the end. And if not it won't be a huge loss and I get to try a new phone for a few months.

20355	Cell Reception Issue	Hello everyone. I've been having issues with reception pretty well since I got the phone. It's Snapdragon variant, purchased unlocked from Samsung. I use the Telus network in Toronto (major metropolitan area). My girlfriend has a Pixel 5 and she has 5G pretty well constantly on the same network. My signal drops in the metropolitan area to LTE and sometimes 4G. Sometimes I am in a call and voice cuts off on both ends if it doesn't drop completely. Of course, sometimes network speeds are also unusable. 5G does seem to work maybe 50-60% of the time but it's still pretty annoying as this is a basic phone function. Samsung advised me to drop off at a repair center but I'd like to avoid it if possible. I was hoping this would be a software update fix. I have read on the forums that others are also having this issue. Has anyone had these issues and was able to find a fix? Has anyone had the issues subside with Android 13 / UI 5? Thanks in advance!

Tl;DR: Something causing my mobile data to disconnect every few seconds.

  
I have an issue and I'm not sure how wide-spread it is. My mobile data plan supports all the bells and whistles I need. (5G, Unlimited data &amp; Speed). While the speed I'm okay with, the stability making it unusable. 

*Example:*   
*I would like to join a call on the phone via zoom/teams/slack/whatever, I can see everything, hear everything, they can hear me and see my video. For about 10 seconds. After that, it disconnects me from the internet. App shows that there is no connection available. Couple of seconds in after it disconnected, it reconnects me and I'm back. Not ideal for communicating 20-30mins. I also noticed this sort of flakey usage on Youtube, TikTok, Netlfix any sort of streaming service. Also present when I share my data as hotspot.*

What was done so far:

* Changed carrier SIMs
* Reset APN configuration
* Factory reset
* Change Mobile plans
* Dropped down to only use 4G/3G/LTE instead of 5G preferred
* Contacted Samsung and ran the Smart Tutor app for phone diagnostics. Logs came back that all is fine.
* Had a conversation with the local Samsung service center stating that they need my phone for local diagnostics as they cannot see anything.

On my previous S5 phone I could take my earbuds out of the case, pop them in my ears then tap the button on one of the earbuds and my music would start playing from exactly where it was the last time I listened to it.

 On my new S22 that doesn't work. I have to get the phone and press the Play button on the VLC widget before it will start to play. It does remember where I was, and my earbud button works like normal after that.

I think the problem is that VLC doesn't stay in memory on the S22 like it did on my last phone. I went to deep sleep stuff (in the phone Settings) and set VLC to never go to sleep. I tried to install the old (ancient) version of VLC but my new phone says it can't. I'm not sure what else to try.

20431	Samsung refuses to replace a new S22 Ultra with screen defect	Hello everyone,I am new here to this forums but definitely not new to samsung since me and my family have been using samsung phones for the past 10 years at least and we were pretty happy until now. I just wanna mention that ive tried searching about this problem and see if it happened to other people as well but ive tried my best and havent found anything except one old reddit post (about S21 or 20 Ultra) which had the same screen flaw but even he didnt get any answers. Anyway, I wanna share my short story. I got a brand new S22 Ultra with warranty and everything. After I decided to completely switch to it and start using it I realized there something strange with the screen, right where the fingerprint area is. It was kind like a pop/click sound when i pushed it a little bit hard. The best way I can describe it is as the screen wasnt glued well in that area so the screen kinda glued down and poped back up immediately (or maybe not glued at all). It has no effect on the display itself or the touch quality from what I remember (just the glass so far). But I do wanna mention that I found it out immediately after setting up my fingerprint scanner since it is right there so it definitely something that bothered me - I heard and felt that really well. After I didnt find any help online I wrote a post myself on a reddit community (I can link it if someone wants). After few replies that told me that this stuff is definitely not normal and to return it ASAP I decided to do so and contacted Samsung. I gave them all the information they asked and I even send them a video with the issue. The samsung support then told me to go to the nearest store/lab to examine it closely. So right the next day when we decided to drive there our car broke up in the middle of the road and so we had to go there only next week. Then we came, the people in the Samsung store told us they have never seen such a thing and I said that so am I. Still they said they can not help me since the lab has moved recently and now I had to drive to another location (Thanks samsung, and you yet haven't update it on the website). And finally when we came there the guy told us that according to the laws, 14 days have past I cant reutrn it, only to repair. I said thanks but no thanks. I haven't bought a brand new phone to replace it screen immediately and with a chance to mess with it or even damage the sealing/waterproof. I didnt not buy a phone with a defected screen or with a replaced screen, I would then better off with buying a renewed one (would be cheaper). Annnnd so I am here, with no answers and with no phone, It is still in their store.Can someone tell me if thats OK? What can I do now? what are my options? Did anyone had such a thing before? Ill be really sad if now my brand new phone will have to go through a screen replacement.Sorry for venting maybe too much but I am kinda annoyed right now that I have to go such a thing with an a brand new phone.

20434	Numerous Android apps continually crash after launching -- PLEASE HELP!	"Hello,For whatever reason, I started noticing at least 5 or 6 apps I use on a regular basis crashing every single time I would start them or if they required internet access in order to pre-populate on-screen fields or menus. I'm running Android 13 on my S22 Ultra (Verizon) and have NEVER had an issue like this until this morning.Here is a list of the apps I've confirmed this with:Google App (Latest)Google Keyboard (Latest)GMail (Latest)Flow Free (Game - Latest)Flow Free Bridges (Game - Latest)Flow Free Warps (Game - Latest)Etc.There are others showing this behavior, but this group is sufficient enough to make my point.The only way I've been able to resolve this issue is to reboot the phone. Once the reboot is complete, I am able to revisit the apps and use them as I normally would, but within 30 or 40 minutes the problem is back, again. I've never seen anything like it.When apps try spinning up in the background, a dialog gets displayed asking if I want to clear that app's cache in order to remedy its issue. When I confirm I want to do that and the cache gets cleaned, it doesn't fix the problem and the app crashes, anyway.I am hoping someone else has encountered this issue who can help shed some light on what's happening, here? I suspect there is a common module being used by these apps and that module is having problems which in turn is affecting all other modules which use it? I have no way of knowing what that module could be, though?I wanted to post this here before I started shooting in the dark by creating Android error reports and sending them. I have no reason to believe anyone really ever sees the reports I send via that channel.Is there a better way to escalate something like this? All feedback is very much appreciated!Kind Regards,Marcus HarrisSolved!Go to Solution.

20435	Not seeing notification symbols after new update	Is anyone else having issues after the new update? I'm not seeing my notification symbols when I pull down to see them. They're just showing white circles. I'm also having issues when I turn my phone to landscape mode. When I turn my phone, the screen stays stuck in portrait mode. I've tried turning auto rotate on and off multiple times, but it still won't work. I've also restarted my phone, I just wanted to see if anyone else is having trouble after this update?

20439	Camera enhancement idea/request	It would be a great addition if there was a way to quickly override the folder where new images will be put (in a given camera session only--should default to Camera")... There are times I want to shoot a number of images for various uses and don't really want them on my camera folder (and then have to move them). A "folder selection" button would be wonderful!Surprised that none of the various device camera apps seem to have this... It could go a long way towards organizing images by allowing a little "pre-organizing" in those situations where such is appropriate and useful.
