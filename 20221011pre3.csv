Traded my note 20 ultra for s22 ultra green 512gb	Couldn't pass up the deal got $950 for the note,only paid $630 for a used note 20 off ebay few months ago, also traded old cracked screen iPhone 8 plus, and other $100 off discount that they got going on, so got the s22 ultra for $200, not to bad considering didn't have a warranty for the 20, anybody else do the same? Gonna miss the micro sd card, but 512 should be plenty for me, really like the note hope this new phone don't disappoint.	N
Upgrade from S21+?	I currently have the S21+ and was wondering if anyone thought it was worth it to upgrade to the S22 Ultra. Or if anyone had upgraded and thought it was worth it.	N

New to s22u, and android all together	"Just got a new s22u. I have been iPhone since the 3Gs. There is a learning curve but so far I really like it. (I feel like there should be a bald eagle waiving an American flag squawking freedom) 
What are the must have apps, and tricks? I see I need an ad blocker. Any suggestions? I don‚Äôt know how to take things slow I‚Äôm driving right in. I can‚Äôt read these forums fast enough so any suggestions are welcome. Why didn‚Äôt y‚Äôall tell me to do this sooner? 
Only gripe so far, imessage. I am going to try VMware on an old laptop to see if I can skirt apples no android policy. Anyone have any luck with that?"	N
Perfect screen protection without compromise	"I had the S21 ultra whcibcame with a screen protector pre-installed that was perfect. It did not show marks. Did not affect fingerprint and most importantly did not affect picture quality.
Now the S22 is sold without it and I am looking for a good one to protect the screen from scratches. I don't like glass ones.
Any ideas?"	N
Part 4 of the quick review about my transition from Note9 to S22Ultra (plus some references to iPhone 13 mini and travel superzoom)	"Both are Exynos versions (and I still have both).
First 3 parts were here -  [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNote9/comments/sqnev8/quick_comparative_review_note9_vs_s22ultra_part_1/) , [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNote9/comments/stolkv/quick_comparative_review_note9_vs_s22ultra_part_2/) , [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNote9/comments/t2riop/quick_comparative_review_note9_vs_s22ultra_part_3/).
There have been some other software updates - at least 2 in April in Exynos region (and some people even got 3) and I feel there might still be 1-2 updates that could bring certain optimizations that are still not present.
Around part 3 I have finished the transfer of everything that I wanted to the S22U and since then I also have taken the S22U to a real-world test = a trip of about 10 days to Barcelona. For that trip I had the S22 Ultra as main phone and the iPhone 13 mini (+ Apple Watch) as backup / work phone, and I was surprised by some of the things I have learned.
First things first - I will repeat something I was saying back in part 1, pictures are a very clear improvement and also phone responsiveness is better even in power-saving mode (vs Note9 in full performance mode).
Battery life did NOT get significantly better from updates - but some improvements were made by specific settings.
During the trip the biggest issue that I had with the S22U was in fact battery life - I was always keeping the phone in PowerSaving mode and even like that in two of the busiest days the phone failed to make it over the 20:00 mark, in fact the first time it did not make it past the 18:00 mark :(
First instance was literally in the first full day in Barcelona, and on that occasion most of the problem was the transition from a reliable super-easy to find fingerprint sensor on the back of the Note9 to the rather complex combination of always-on ultrasonic fingerprint plus face recognition on S22U. In a normal work day the difference is not really visible since I don't unlock the phone too much and in-between the S22U is left untouched somewhere on a desk face-up, but in a day where I was unlocking it probably more than 10-20 times more often and I was storing it in various pockets and I was moving around a lot the difference became painfully visible - the phone was registering all kind of touches from my pockets and was trying to activate the screen and the face recognition all the time with the result of a huge amount of extra battery drain. That lesson was quickly learned and from that point on the face recognition was disabled (safety on that also is not great) and also I disabled the always-on ultrasonic fingerprint - that instantly made battery drain in such scenarios better (at the cost of now losing almost one extra second when unlocking, not ideal but I can live with it).
The 2nd instance was somehow trickier with a complex usage pattern with a huge lot of pictures plus Maps tracking plus probably tricky cellular signal, but the power usage dialog towards the end of the day was suggesting almost half of the battery drain was coming from the Camera app - that was not entirely unexpected since on that day I tried to use a little more the 108 megapixel mode with ""Detail enhancer"" ON, and that obviously does a LOT of processing but to me it still points to a major lack of battery optimization, even more so with PowerSaving ON (and CPU at most 70%).
At this point I also need to compare against the iPhone 13 mini - in the first day I was doing ALL the maps/directions-related stuff on the i13m, I was still taking a lot of pictures (about one picture on it for every two on the S22U) and almost all the video on that one too and yet it not only ""survived"" to the end of the day and provided the directions back at the hotel, but it was still having like 30% battery at that point (3-4 hours after the S22U shut-down itself). That is from a tiny phone with a battery capacity that is exactly 1/2 of the S22U. The pictures are IMHO better on the S22U and the extra zoom is a huge thing but the video is often better on the i13m (except video at night when lens flare on the i13m gets crazy, but photos at night with a moving subject are better again on i13m, even better in i13Pro).
The one other interesting thing in this comparison was GPS - before this in my normal use I was not seeing a significant difference between i13m and S22U on GPS but in Barcelona things got very extreme, for instance getting in one of the touristic buses and comparing side-by-side the position and orientation was showing a very clear advantage for the S22U over i13m (I suspect the difference is mainly from the fact that S22U does have dual-band L1+L5 GPS while probably Apple does not - [read here for more links and details](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/amob8i/last_weekend_we_talked_about_how_not_all_ble_5/)). I did not have a chance to test the Note9 side-by-side under same (reflexion-intensive) conditions but that one also does not have L5 GPS. On the other hand the i13m sometimes seems to be draining less power when using GPS, so there are tradeoffs to be made.
One comparison that you will not see in any other review - yes, the S22U has probably the best zoom you can get now in a camera phone, but is it as good as the zoom on a ""travel superzoom""? Probably best in that class is currently Sony RX100 VII but that came very late in the game and the entire RX100 line was very expensive (RX100 VII is about as expensive as S22U middle models) so years before I had a huge deal on the Panasonic TZ202 (around 1/3 of my S22U) and I took that one on my trip too, and for one very specific scenario that was a very good idea.
That scenario was about fast moving objects pretty far away under somehow less then ideal light conditions - [here is a picture of FAA serving taken with S22U in auto-mode ](https://i.imgur.com/NZgtDfV.jpeg) and [here is a picture taken just minutes later with the TZ202 in auto-mode](https://i.imgur.com/3vvEMuj.jpeg). If you zoom on the face you will see that on the S22U you can't really recognize him but on the TZ202 you can. Movement is part of the problem - [here is a picture with Carlos Alcaraz taken on TZ202 when fast-moving](https://i.imgur.com/nkwxiG4.jpeg) and [here is one on S22U when not moving that fast](https://i.imgur.com/KhxpB1o.jpeg). Even more than that, when the light is very good and the object is close and not moving the main S22U sensor/lens [is the clear winner in 108 megapixel mode](https://i.imgur.com/Smot27g.jpeg). And yes, it did cross my mind that the tennis pictures taken with a SLR and a lens like [this](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/732108-USA/Canon_4411B002_EF_300mm_f_2_8L_IS.html/specs) would be orders of magnitude better but it's not just the price, is the entire thing of having to carry a monster like that all day with you. In fact I did not carry the TZ202 for more than 1-2 days but a trip is not about getting the best picture, is also about enjoying the trip itself.
So the bottom line is that S22U is not perfect, in fact is very far from that, but for the moment the competition is even less perfect, later this year Xiaomi Mi 12 Ultra might again have better camera sensors on launch but software support and updates are not in the same class, and possibly the iPhone 14 Pro / Pro Max will also get a better/newer sensor for the main lens but no superzoom."

How long will you keep your S22Ultra?	"I upgraded from a S21U which I had for just about a year. I probably would not have upgraded but I made a mistake and bought the 128GB version, which I knew would be inadequate over multiple years.
So, I bought myself the S22U with 256GB. I expect to keep this phone for at least 4 years (timed to match with Samsung's update promises, which hopefully they will deliver on).
How long do you plan to keep yours?"	N

is it possible to customize S-pen more?	"I've been using the S22 Ultra for about a month coming from the S20 Ultra, it's my first phone with an s-pen.
It is nice to have the pen, but i feel like with the standard settings you are able to change, it is very limited what you can use the pen for.
1. I really like the ""scroll"" function where you move the pen to the bottom of the screen and it scrolls for you, but it's slow and you have to keep it there for a while before it scrolls + it only works with a few apps. 
2. The button on the s-pen, you can only use it for apps + navigation, it could be more useful if you could make special commands with it.
3. Air actions is clever but you have to press the tiny buttom on the pen everytime time to use it, which makes it slow and a pain to use.
Is there an app or something to make the S-pen even more useful? Or are there some settings i can't find to fix these things?
Is anyone else seeing opertunities with the s-pen that arent possible yet?"	N
How to play lossless audio?	This is my first samsung phone after having iPhones for several years. I recently started using Amazon music HD to listen to high res music, and I never had any issue with playing the ultra HD songs through my iPhone 8 and an external dac (fiio btr5). Now I'm trying the same dac, plugged into my s22 with a short usb-c to usb-c cable that came with the dac, and it limits the files being played to 48khz (the bit depth isn't affected). Is there a simple step im missing? In iPhone settings you have to physically turn on lossless audio but I can't find anything like that in my s22's settings.	N
I see a lot of complaints on this sub. As a new S22U owner with no issues, a few thoughts from an IT professional	"First and foremost, I know how much easier life can seem if you use Smart Switch or have your carrier transfer all of your data. I never, ever let anyone touch my device before I do. I don't let the rep at the carrier store open my phone for me, transfer my data, nothing. Any information they need is on one of the many labels outside of the box.
Second, when setting up a new phone, I don't connect to any network when prompted. I skip all of the prompts to connect to WiFi or activate my device with my mobile provider. 
Third, after the initial ""welcome expience"" (when you're prompted to set up your device), I decline all diagnostic collection, location services, etc.
Fourth, I go through the list of apps and disable or uninstall any carrier bloat (Verizon Message+, Verizon Cloud, Smart Switch, etc). Anything I don't intend to use is disabled or removed.
Fifth, I configure system settings (dark mode, screen timeout, determine what apps I want to have access to background data, etc).
Sixth, connect to WiFi, sign into my Google / Samsung account(s), and update my apps via Google Play / Galaxy Store.
Seventh, check for system / OS updates and let it update. Continue restarting my device and checking for system updates until none are left.
Eighth, restart my device in recovery mode and clear system cache.
Ninth, allow carrier activation to proceed and begin signing into my apps.
Finally, download Good Guardians from the Galaxy app store and run Galaxy App Booster.
Yes, I've skipped transferring my data. Yes, this was a lot of work. Yes, my battery will still take a few days to assert itself and give me some indication of what expectations I might have in terms of performance, but I've been doing it this way for years and it helps me to avoid several problems that many people run into by simply transferring my data at the carrier store or with Smart Switch.
I can't tell you how many times someone will call me and say ""I got a new phone and now I can't get any of my work email"" or ""my calendar won't sync."" What your carrier doesn't know (or neglects to mention) is that your device has a unique identifier and a corporate email server / cloud server will reject your attempts to send or receive email if you simply transfer your apps and account settings. You need to delete the account from your phone, then re-add your email account. This is only one example and mainly applies to Exchange / O365 accounts.
Another issue I've seen is that people struggle with Android Auto with the various S22 models. After digging around a bit, I found that this typically affects people who use Smart Switch. Unsurprisingly, I set everything up manually and had no issues with Android Auto.
Mileage may vary, but I wanted to throw this out there to lend a hand from someone that has been in the tech business for a couple of decades. 
I'm happy to help anyone if you have any questions or elaborate on anything mentioned above."	N

S22 delivery issues	"Hello everybody,
as my s22+ (exynos, green, 256 Gb) still hasn't arrived yet, I wanted to ask you guys whether it is still worth it to stick to the purchase or cancel it.
I ordered on the 3rd of March in my nearby electronics store (Mediamarkt, Germany) where they told me I would get the phone until the beginning/middle of April.
Order details:
* Galaxy S22 Plus 5G 256 GB Green: 1099‚Ç¨
* Galaxy Buds Pro: 0‚Ç¨ (worth is about 100‚Ç¨)
* trade in promotion (my current S9 64 GB): -240¬†‚Ç¨
So my total cost is 859,00‚Ç¨. (\~ 904 USD)
I already did a deposit of half of that amount when I ordered it. They told me that I could revoke the purchase whenever I want to. Furthermore, the trade in promotion originally was due to the 1st of April but however I was told that they extended it. I don't think that the galaxy will arrive until mid or end of May.
I am not really planning on using the buds pro as I don't like the way they look and already got some earbuds, so I would try to sell them on eBay or smth and hopefully get around 100‚Ç¨ for them. The battery of my S9 unfortunately gets worse every day and the performance pretty slow as well, but still does its job somehow.
So far, the price of the S22 series seems pretty stable and I would still consider this a good price, especially regarding the discount I got from the trade in of my S9. So do you all think it is worth the wait? Or should I just cancel it and get an S21 FE or A53 maybe? As my concerns are that my S9 is slowly dying and if I somehow get the display scratched or anything, I won't be able to get the discount for it.
When did you order yours and when did it arrive?"	N

Accessories for S22 Ultra	"Hey. I'm thinking of getting S22 Ultra and I'd like to get some help with choosing accessories for it. 
Colour for the phone would be Sky Blue so I'd like to get clear phone case. I have been reading several comments and it seems either UAG, Spigen or Ringke would be good choice considering price/quality/protection. Which one would you get? UAG seems to be most expensive one. Spigen cases are prone to yellowing? Don't know much about Ringke. 
UAG Plyo is 35‚Ç¨ on Amazon.de, but P shaped camera cutout looks little weird. Does it protect cameras like those cases with individual cutouts for each camera? There is also Ringke Fusion and Air cases and from Spigen there is Ultra Hybrid and Liquid Crystal. Cases from Ringke and Spigen are cheaper than UAG but how is their quality?
With phone case, I also want some protection for screen. Many seem to use Whitestone Dome Glass which I could get from Amazon for 40‚Ç¨ (2pack). Is it compatible with cases I listed earlier? Any other good screen protectors?
I also need new charger. Official Samsung charger might be safe bet I think, though it is quite expensive (45W model atleast)."	N

Best Buy trade-in promo for Verizon Galaxy S22 Series Question	"Hello everyone! This is my first post here, but I was hoping to get some information/help with the promo value upgrade trade-in process. Best Buy currently has a discount on the S22 series for Verizon specifically, and they are also offering the $700 upgrade trade-in through Verizon, so it's a really great deal tbh. The information about the deal is on this [Best Buy promo page](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-store/verizon-galaxy-s22-offer/pcmcat1644515081836.c?id=pcmcat1644515081836). I went ahead and purchased the S22+ from Best Buy for the 36 month payment plan which will arrive on Thursday (May 5), signed in through Verizon, selected the correct line to be upgraded (my OnePlus 7t), and checked out. 
So, I guess my question is, what exactly am I supposed to do now? Best Buy doesn't provide the trade-in themselves; they just tell me to go through Verizon. But, where exactly do I go to submit my trade-in for the promo credit value ($700), instead of the base trade-in offer for the OnePlus 7t ($43)? When I go into my Verizon account, there's an option on my line to ""Upgrade Now"", but that's just to buy another device through Verizon. That's not what I want, because I already ordered it through Best Buy. Whenever I receive and activate the S22+ on my account, am I supposed to just submit a regular trade-in, and they'll just know it's supposed to be for the promo amount? Thanks for the help in advance!"	N
Samsung S22 Ultra or IPhone 13 Pro	I'm thinking of getting a new phone this week since my Samsung S9 is old now plus the battery/glitches/lags I keep getting is really starting to annoy me. The thing is I can't decide which phone is better. I'm more concerned about battery and customization. I mainly use my phone for gaming, youtube, surfing sites and school stuff. I'm not really worried about camera or video taking since I don't do it a lot. Please help! ( I'm an idiot when it comes to technology lol)	N
Samsung S22 or One Plus 9/10 pro for an upgrade?	"So I've been trying to get a new phone for a while now because I currently have a Samsung A20. My previous phones were the iPhone 5c when it first came out, the Samsung S6 edge and the Samsung S8 before getting what I have now. I've had this phone for maybe 3 years now and it's really slow and I want to move back to the flagship lines because I want more ram, a better camera, a nice refresh rate, good battery life, and a good processor. With this phone though any of these phones accomplish that, I kinda just want my best bang for my buck.
As much as I don't want to spend the money on a new phone it's getting slow and I'm getting fed up with my calls constantly dropping, never going through, or never even recieving calls to begin with.
I've already looked at the specs and I'm torn between whether I want to stick with Samsung and go with the S22 or move to One Plus and either get the 9 or 10 pro. I was hoping to try and save money where I could and I've noticed that a lot of people that have the OP9pro dont feel the need or want to upgrade to the 10. I prefer the design of the OP and when I was looking at in the store I really liked it. I've never used OP so I dont know what it's like with every day use. 
I originally was also looking at the Samsung S20 since it still has the SD card slot but my main concern was that i dont know how long it will continue to recieve updates and I want to try and get a phone that will last me a while. I also just think I want a nice new phone for once instead of getting older models.
A plus would also be to smoothly run Genshin Impact. any advice or help would be appreciated
TLDR: 
- currently have a Samsung A20 and want to upgrade 
- must have better processor, camera, ram, and refresh rate than what I currently have
- must be something that will last me for a while
- do not want to go back to Apple
- best bang for my buck?"	N
The S22 Ultra is actually worse than my 2 year old Note 20 Ultra in almost all categories except for camera. This is unacceptable.	"I am not gonna sugar coat this - I am so disappointed and frustrated with Samsung. After playing with this phone and comparing it side by side with my old Note 20 ultra I can clearly say there is literally no reason for you to get the S22 Ultra unless you disproportionately value camera quality.
**Pros of the S22 Ultra:**
*
* The camera (I have to give credit where credit is due - the camera is indeed much better than older phones)
* 
**Cons of the S22 Ultra:**
* Noticably weaker and tinnier speakers (tried EQ trick - doesnt help)
* HDR video playback is way darker than older gens (you can check for video proof online - this is the SD version)
* Vibration motor is weak as hell (why would you change the axis) - literally I can barely feel it even in my hand
* Throttling or software unoptimizied: it actually opens numerous apps slower than my 2 year old note 20 ultra - this is completely unacceptable. Try spotify - it is very noticeable.
This is just a PSA for you note lovers being swayed by the suspicious amounts of biased reviews on this phone."	N
Opinions on S21U to S22U upgrade?	Hello wonderful people! I have two questions in one. In your opinion, is it at all worth it to upgrade from the S21 Ultra to the S22 Ultra? And if so, what are your thoughts on the S22 Ultra's RAM? Currently I have an S21 Ultra with 128gb storage and 12gb RAM. The comparable S22 Ultra model only has 8gb of RAM. I'm not sure I'm comfortable "upgrading" to less RAM. Can anyone tell me, from personal experience, if the difference matters for practical purposes? The thing is, I'll absolutely pay extra for the 256gb/12gb model, IF it's worth it. So ... I'm collecting opinions.	N
Can an S22 Ultra replace a tablet?	So I'm considering buying a companion device for school to go alongside my laptop. Would mostly use it for note-taking during math class. I was interested in getting an iPad mini 6 but if I can combine two devices into one that would be great.	N

Samsung Support From India - With false information/lack of knowledge	I have bought S22 Ultra with two (iPhones) trade in;Phone was delivered@March 29th and Tradein phones are sent to samsung within a week (Which was my biggest mistake);April 8th, 2022: Later after 1 week of use - I have noticed settings page/Apps page blank screen issue, which was also troubleshooted by Technical PRO team and asked to return phoneApril 14th, 2022: This is where I was miscommunicated by support team (Order/Returns/Refund) - Phone was returned and then support team informed me I need to wait for trade_in phone RTC (ReturnToCustomer) to purchase new orderApril 22, 2022: I have waited for a week and then again reached support team - Agent informed me TradeIn phones will be sent back in 1-2 business days, its almost ready for return shipmentApril 28th, 2022: Again I have reached support team (7th time from March order) - now agent informed me that trade in phones are approved - it can't be returned to customer;Its my 7th chat conversation with support team - I have all the support tickets, which are useless as one support agent information will not match with other;Now based on last agent conversation - Promo code will be initiated for trade in values - it will be 2 business days and there will not be any confirmation email to customer; If code is not received in a week asked me again to reach support team!!!!This may sound like simple return/refund issue but each agent sharing false information and asking to wait is frustrating!From last 1 month - Im using old iPhone as I'm in an impression that new S22 Ultra can be ordered in 2-4 days but its been 25 days and without any resolution.

S22ss plus	So I finally decided to upgrade my phone, I have an s9 and its starting to show its age. So I went to go get the new s22.What a fiasco...First I couldn't get the standard 22 in any color other than white, yuck. Then I decided to go to the next level the s22plus, again I couldn't get the phone in black. I had 2 colors to choose from, green or pink, so begrudgingly I settled on the green since I was not going to upgrade even further. I had to wait over a month for the phone to arrive, I understand the delay due to the current global climate. But then when my phone finally arrived I was flabbergasted to discover i didn't even get a proper charger, just a double ended type c wire with no outlet peice. And I'm just struggling to understand why i didnt receive a charger with my purchase, especially with all the issues with getting a phone I was content with and the price I had to pay. I usually advocate for Samsung and I just find this incredibly frustrating and truthfully stingy on Samsung part...	N
Google Messages	I got the S22 ultra last month and Google messages is the default Messaging app. This is great because I've used that with my previous device the S20FE. I am a beta tester and for the past several weeks had access to the button that would convert iPhone reactions into into emoji's. After doing some research it appears that T-Mobile controls the back end of Google messages through the network and not Google or jibe as previously on other models. Any help getting that functionality back would be greatly appreciated. T-Mobile has indicated that Samsung is working on an update to correct this on the s22 and they are waiting for the software to be pushed out but there is no date identified. Is anyone else having the same issue? Is there a workaround? Any clarification is appreciated. Thanks.	N
How to mark up Photos & Documents with Typed Text	Hey can someone please answer a question? I got the S22 Ultra and I have been using the iPhone 13 Pro Max before. For the most part, I like the S22 but something VERY simple that can be done on an iPhone is marking up a photo. For example, I had to fill out an authorization form and I was only able to figure out how to hand write the info. I would like to type the info into the appropriate fields. I can do that very easily and fast on the iPhone. I am sure there is an easy way to do it on the Ultra but can't figure it out. Can someone help?	N

S22 Ultra purchased in Korea. Will shutter sound turn off entering US?	Hello,I received a galaxy s22 ultra as a gift in Korea.

Upgrade from an S8 (Yes, you read that right) is it too soon?	"I'm not a big spender on phones, I use mine every day but am always fine with the simple version and honestly hate the idea of spending $1k+ on a phone, but I have an opportunity to get an S22 Ultra 128gb for $900 new+unlocked. 
I've had my Galaxy S8 for over 4 years now, bought it new+unlocked for $250 at Walmart on clearance, and it's done me justice till recently, lots of app crashing, slow, etc.
Is the Galaxy S22 Ultra right for me? I love the zoom feature when I tested it at Best Buy, but am hesitant to grab the newest model of a phone, especially one this costly, or would the simple S22 be good enough for someone like me (would be $630)?"	N
Looking for a case with proper side lip protection.	"I've looked at almost all s22 ultra cases on youtube and Amazon and as much as they provide top and bottom lip protection,  i am yet to find a case that offer proper side lip protection. Seeing as the bevelled sides make the screen vulnerable, I was wondering if any of you know of such a case which can protect the screen if it were to hit the side of the table or something such that the phone does not get a chance to land on it's (screen) face and consequently the top and bottom lip don't get to help.

S21 Ultra or S22 Ultra	"I‚Äôm planning on switching over to Samsung shortly, and I need help deciding on which of these two models to get. I've been using my iPhone X for 3.5 years, and it's pretty beat up, so I've decided why not go Samsung.
At first, it seems like a no-brainer as the S22U is newer, but from what I can tell it's not as stable and has worse battery life (I‚Äôd like to know how these two phones' battery life would compare to my X as it‚Äôs struggling to get more than 3.5-4hr of SoT). 
The problem is that I've been checking the S21U prices and they haven't dropped yet; it‚Äôs also a year older. I really would like to keep this new phone for a similar amount of time as the X unless massive improvements from either brand happen.
Some other info: I‚Äôve got 21-22cm hands if that matters (the X can be uncomfortable at times) and I have a MacBook ‚Äî would like lots of help on deciding on the phone and making the switch!"	N

Interested in buying the S22 Ultra. Help me answer my weird and specific questions before trading in my Flip 3.	"Just feel free to answer any of these questions:
A: Should I get the S22 Ultra if my Flip 3 trade in is worth $775 right now? Plus offering a free storage upgrade from 128gb to 256gb. Will there ever be a better deal than that? Can I trade in a phone if I still owe Samsung a couple hundred on it? I like the flip 3, but battery life doesn't last me a full day ever, and S22 Ultra is an upgrade in about every category.
B: Which color should I get? I want one that will work in the long run and not chip, fade, or show scratches as much.
C: You know how the curved edges of the screen sometimes have a green or red tint to it? Is there a display settings to calibrate this, similar to how the S8 Plus has a edge display tool for customizing the tint to it? It was to help get the edge of the screen to blend in better with the rest of the screen.
D: How's battery life? What's the typical screen on time?
E: Does the unlocked US version have the snapdragon and does it work well with other carriers like Visible, and Viareo?
F: What's a good case that's thin but will protect it? What's a good screen protector that works well with the S Pen?
G: How do you convince a Flip 3 owner to trade in their device and get the S22 Ultra? lol 
H: Or do I save $200 and go for the S22 Plus? Honestly don't mind it's smaller size, flatter screen, and lower price. Can't find too many reviews on it though."	N
switching phone cases	"Does switching cases often damage the 'paint' of the phone?  I had a zfold3 once, and one of the group members on FB said that it is because he frequently switched cases. I googled and did some research, relevant results are dated from 2012 to 2016. And I believe phones now are more durable, but we can't be too sure, right? So I'm asking fellow redditors what your experience is.
If you do switch cases frequently, kindly share how often. I currently have 2 cases only, and switch them out every month."	N

Note 8 to S22: Upgrade?	"My service provider is offering $800 for eligible trade-in's, my Note 8 being a prime candidate.
When  I bought my Note 8 back in 2017, I swore off of ""leasing"" phones. But with every product these days, it's a futile attempt at combating planned obsolescence. Nonetheless, I bought a flagship to use as long as possible. For the most part I've done that, but I could comfortably stretch out the life of this Note another 3 years. It's not slow, camera quality is great, battery and screen were replaced last year through insurance, 1440p@60hz for general web browsing/content consumption is still amazing, and it's a pretty phone (bezels and all).
As I see it, there's two reasons to upgrade.
1. Security updates
2. A cost-free trade to a S22, essentially rolling the value forward for not only this upgrade, but the next.
Question 1: How important are security updates?
Updated security or not, the user of any device connected to the internet is always the primary deterrent against any malicious software/exploits. I'd consider myself a safe user. I don't download many apps nor do I install random APKs. I don't visit funky websites and I use a VPN on public networks. Overall, my phone usage is pretty basic. However, I don't want to dismiss the effectiveness of security updates, so just how exposed am I?
Question 2: How would battery life of an S22 compare to a Note 8 or 9 with new battery?
The community has mixed feelings/opinions on S22 battery life. If it's roughly what could be expected of a Note 8 or 9 (brand new or with replacement battery), it wouldn't be something I'd consider a problem. S22+ or Ultra are not options this time around.
Thank you for reading!
TL;DR: I love my Note 8. Are security updates and $800 trade-in value substantial enough reasons to upgrade?"	N

It looks like I could get the S22+ but it's truly not my dream phone, i know it's nitpicking but i also don't like the white version.
The S21U seems like the best Samsung would have to offer (if they wouldn't discontinue it)
I was thinking I could sell the 22+ &amp; buy an S21U. 
What do you think, does it worth it? 
It's possible I will attempt this, just because I've been in love with this phone &amp; overall it would probably make me more comfortable, even tho buying one could be stressful because of the lack of availability &amp; my need to have a phone for work."	N

S21 Ultra or S22 Ultra	"I‚Äôm planning on switching over to Samsung shortly, and I need help deciding on which of these two models to get. I've been using my iPhone X for 3.5 years, and it's pretty beat up, so I've decided why not go Samsung.
At first, it seems like a no-brainer as the S22U is newer, but from what I can tell it's not as stable and has worse battery life (I‚Äôd like to know how these two phones' battery life would compare to my X as it‚Äôs struggling to get more than 3.5-4hr of SoT). 
The problem is that I've been checking the S21U prices and they haven't dropped yet; it‚Äôs also a year older. I really would like to keep this new phone for a similar amount of time as the X unless massive improvements from either brand happen.
Some other info: I‚Äôve got 21-22cm hands if that matters (the X can be uncomfortable at times) and I have a MacBook ‚Äî would like lots of help on deciding on the phone and making the switch!"	N

Do NOT purchase your Samsung S22 Ultra on Amazon	"I got scammed by Amazon while purchasing a 128GB and 512GB S22U. 
I purchased a 512GB unit after setting up my S22U 128GB and playing with the camera because I had less than 20% space available and noticed video takes more space than my old phone. 
I tried to return the 128GB version online and over the phone to Amazon, who said the item is non refundable. 
I checked, and at no point during the checkout process does this come up anywhere, anytime. This seems illegal, but they just played corporate hot potato and told me to call 1 800 SAMSUNG, who I'm fairly certain will not take an Amazon receipt and refund me. 
I wrote a review about this very similar to what I wrote above and Amazon REMOVED MY REVIEW. 
Going to drive 4 hours to a Samsung store this week to see if I can return it or not, but for all those looking to purchase a new phone, do NOT trust Amazon with your money."	N

THANKS NXpCvJddgi for the Heads Up	ThanksNXpCvJddgi for your post regarding USB-C Flash Drives! I was really peeved how we lost the ability to use removable storage until I came acrossNXpCvJddgi's post.These flash drives completely negate the need of microSD cards.. Samsung currently offers these 2 in 1 drives up to 256GB, they're faster than microSD Cards, consist of USB 3.1 & USB-C and are more convenient to carry around.IfNXpCvJddgi hadn't posted this information I never would've known these existed. They're actually easier to use since you just plug it in rather than having to physically remove a card from the dual SIM port.You plug it in, backup your stuff, unmount, upload it to your puter and your done.Thanks Man	N

Swipe typing issue with all keyboards since start of April	So many have reported this on Reddit and other forums. I wasn't going to report it but It's driving me super crazy.To me it seems less about getting the word correct and more about the keyboard kinda "skip ping." It's like it thinks your finger lifted up a fraction of a section, so it ends the word where connection was lost and starts a new one. The word skipping above was an example, it thought my finger lifted and ended up separating it into two words. Really annoying, not really a word selection issue, but a glitch.It's making the phone unusable.It's maddening. Have been using swipe typing since my first smartphone, back when Swype was the only game in town. I switched to gboard and Samsung keyboard eventually and it has been great up until now. It **bleep** up over ten times just typing this out. Nope, make that twelve times, I hope they fix it soon otherwise will be sending the phone back.To Samsung support: Please refrain from copy pasting generic advice to reset phone, remove cache etc as so many users have done it and so many have complained and reported the issue with no support.More over you had the nerve to mark the previous ticket as SOLVED when it is clearly not -https://us.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-S22/Keyboard-swiping-bug/td-p/2250246Here is link to one of the posts on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS22/comments/u8y4cz/does_anyone_have_issues_with_swipe_typing_with/?u...

May update (VZW locked) May have fixed lag issues	"I've had terrible lag with the phone (Snapdragon) I guess similar to what many were experiencing with Exynos since day 1: keyboard pops up but doesn't accept any input for a good second, camera shutter lag as well as transitioning from portrait to landscape, and various other situations where taps don't register such as quickly switching between apps. 
I'm a little because I didn't have automatic updates on and didn't see the update was available until after the weekend. The only reason I bought this phone was because VZW offerent $1000 for the trade of my unlocked S21 Ultra that I got for $800. 
This is my second unit as I exchanged the first because of the issues but the replacement was the same. But since most people had no issues I decided to wait it out for a couple updates as I was sure it was software and therefore fixable. 
Only a day in but I feel much better with this phone now. I am curious as to why only a small number of users experienced the lag issue though."	N

Factory Reset: Am I doing something wrong?	"With A11, I never really had any issues with factory resetting my phone and having my backup restore properly. But with A12, it seems to be a maze trying to figure out the proper way to restore.   
I have attempted to restore at least 4 times at this point, trying different things each time. The only time I was able to do to get a somewhat 'proper' restoration point, was by restoring from my Google backup first, and the Samsung second. What is odd, is that my phone almost turns into a Pixel phone before my Samsung backup kicks in, with the giant text and notification bubbles. I literally did a backup of everything **an hour** prior to the factory reset, and some of my information still wasn't restored properly. I have 3 days worth of app data that didn't get restored, Samsung notes all through April are gone (even with backup turned on), and don't get me started on the OneDrive backup for the Gallery app. What gives??   
Does anyone have any information on restoring properly after a reset? I don't understand why there are so many overlapping restoration points, making it complicated for the user to start fresh. I have too much app data throughout the years for me to install apps one by one. Any help would be appreciated."	N

North America Samsung Ceo Email	I've had one of the worse experiences with samsung support.

Then received my label for repair while my phone was being sent in for refund. I had the package returned because I just wanted the repair and did not want to wait another month for a exclusive color delivery.I sent the phone out with repair label and this started a sh#t show. I ended up talked to a samsung representative from ever continent. This resulted in samsung holding my phone hostage, they would not release my phone till I payed 250$.After weeks of this I caved in and paid. Yet because of all the confusion it seems like my phone is registered as a refunded phone even tho I paided for the repair.I didn't receive my 100$ Google play promotion, and I'm sure my trade in phone is not lost in a warehouse in Texas because the order is still registered as a refund.Samsung support is so disorganized they have so many departments and it seems that none of them work together.I have been trying to email the north American ceo office to clear this all up. I have contacted every possible way to get this email and it seems like a huge loop hole.They refer me to the web site but the website only has the India ceo email. I contact them and they just send me a automated reply that sends me back to the website with there email.Does any one for the love of God have the north American samsung ceo email???	N

Schedule Always-On and brightness based on time of day and day of week	"Hi there, 
I use time schedule for when my Always On Display on my S22 shows, so that there is no light at night. However it would be even better if I could set different times for Mon -> Fri and the weekend. Is there any way this could be done that people know of? 
Secondly, I'dlove to set the brightness of my phone similarly by time of day - minimum brightness at night and then boost it in the morning at a set time. Any suggestions? 
Thanks."	N

Does anyone know of a way, either an app or a certain charger brick, to get an adaptive charge similar to iPhone or Pixel 6 Pro?	"I actually replaced my A71 5G with a Pixel 6 Pro and after 3 weeks of nothing but small (but annoying) issues I swapped it out for an S22 Ultra in Green. 
That said, the only thing I miss from my Pixel is the adaptive charging feature. Basically it would speed charge for 80%, then slow down significantly until it got closer to the time your alarm clock was set to go off. 
It's a genius feature but seems like the only option with these out of the box is the 85% max charge function. 
Curious if there are any bricks or (more likely)  any apps that might replicate that?"	N
Trade in value fluctuating rapidly	"So I've been trying to decide whether to trade in my S10 5G for an S22 Ultra. Yesterday, it was $600, after contemplating whether I really need a new phone I decided to go on to buy it. When I checked again it had decreased to $450. With this in mind I'm thinking now I have to really think about it. I go on to check again tonight and it's $450 still, but i decide I might as well chat with Samsung to see if they can honor the previous amount or meet me in the middle. While I'm doing this the price drops again literally in front of my eyes to $210.
How shady is that?? I tried asking them about it saying hey, it literally was $450 like 5 minutes ago and the responses I get are sorry it changes no can do. Really making me reconsider even getting another Samsung phone at this point. Anyone else experience this or have any solutions for it or am I just screwed out of what would of been a great deal?"	N

Samsung Official Film Screen Protector	"My day one Rinke film protector was OK but never perfect. I screwed up the first attempt to apply the rinke was a mess. Luckily the second (you get two) applied OK.
One teeny spec of dust could never be unseen though. I had to cut a peeling corner that manifested because the fit was off, maybe by a mm if that, and it didn't play with my spiegen case.
Saw Sammys official protector at a 50% discount online in the UK via their shop. Superb.
First application immaculate. No issues with the edges, alignment not 'lines' horizontally from the application.
The feel though is the big win here. Previously slightly rubbery with the rinke.... The official one is as close to a natural glass feel as I could have hoped.
Highly recommended. Playing well with my spiegen case."	N

Screw Samsung	"So heres my horror story:
April 15, I contact samsung to send in my mint condition z fold 3 as it has cellular connectivity issues. I package the phone very well, document the packing, reset the phone, take pictures of the entire device including with the screen on to show no damage. Mail the phone. No problem.
Samsung gets the phone, I get a ticket completion notice that the phone has been repaired, during the repair they found my battery and screen were messed up and replaced them. I called samsung and they said if the tech finds problems they will correct them, my screen and battery were fine so im guessing the tech destroyed my stuff but they fixed it and the phone looked flawless so no worries.
A few days go by and the phone starts having massive connectivity problems again. I call samsung back and they say you have to send it in for repair again as we cannot do anything else for you, they kept pushing me to make an insurance claim with samsung care plus which is a joke as they send refurb phones as well as have a deductible. At this point I am requesting a new phone or an ""upgrade"" at minimal cost to me. They tell me the phone must be sent in for repair twice to be considered for any replacement options or anything like that. I agree to send it in even though I really dont want to and I dont trust samsung at all anymore.
I sent the phone in again, they receive it, I packed it just like the first time. I check my email ""You have damage that is out of warranty coverage, your screen is damaged you need to pay $580"" I called them and freaked out. They offered me 25% off the 580 and then when I had been on the phone for a few hours I got a supervisor that is finally able to ""waive the fee as a one time courtesy"". I then call in a couple hours later to confirm the cost has been waived as I had gotten no proof or indication of the repair cost being waived and samsung is acting like lying scammers so who knows. The repair rep informs the cost has been accurately waived and I ask her what do I do when the phone comes back to me and it still has signal issues, as I am sure it will, she says dont worry you have to send it in for repair THREE times before it is considered for a replacement or anything.
Just wanted to get this information out there for anyone who has a premium device with samsung or care plus. FUCK SAMSUNG they have lost my future business and I have had their devices since flip and bar phones back in the day, I was even just shopping for a laptop and they were on the list, they are off the list now and the reviews on their laptops say they suck which seems about in line with their appliances. Samsung is dead to me I sure hope no one else has to deal with their bullshit. I hate to say it but Tmobile would have taken better care of me and I am not a fan of carrier phones.
Thanks for listening. Peace."	N
Battery life woes	Has anyone found any fixes for the battery life on the new s22 phones. I got my S22+(exynos) roughly 3 weeks ago and I guess I am one of the unlucky ones. The battery life on this is atrocious. I have turned off most of the things that make this phone a flagship, running 60Hz, low brightness, dark mode, dark background, 4G and WiFi only, running routines for battery saving mode at night, most apps in deep sleep and yet I consistently get at most 4hours of screen on time. I am capping battery at 85% currently but I still think 4 hours is dreadful. This isn't 4 hours of gaming or watching videos either. That's 4 hours of occasionally checking Facebook and mostly browsing reddit and reading articles in my browser. Even when browsing the web I can see my battery drain and the phone gets warm. I've tried wiping cache folders for apps I've cleaned the cache partition and yet nothing helps. The only other idea I have is factory reseting and starting from scratch but nothing else helped so far... Does anyone have any idea how to fix this or did I just get unlucky with a faulty phone? Any tips appreciated.	N

S22 cases that lay flat?	"Just got my new S22 and am setting it all up, trying to adjust coming from a Pixel 3.  I picked up a Spigen Rugged Armor case which fits great but one little thing that is really annoying - it has a raised lip around the rear cameras, so the whole phone wobbles if you are using it while it lies on a desk.
Any recommendations for a case that you like that lays completely flat?  I see the Spigen Tough Armor for one but hard to tell how bulky it is.
If Spigen would add one little raised corner opposite the cameras on the Rugged Armor, it would be perfect for me.  Just having the top half of the phone raised a tiny bit relatve to the bottom would be fine, at least it wouldn't wobble."	N
In App Biometric Authentication Compared to iPhone Face ID.	I currently use an iPhone 11 and store my passwords with Apple keychain. When logging-in into various apps I use the phone‚Äôs Face ID biometrics to confirm auto population of the app‚Äôs ‚Äúuser name‚Äù and ‚Äúpassword‚Äù request. If I switch to the S22 model line will I use the under-screen fingerprint reader in place of Apple Face ID or do I need to enter the phones security pin-number? I understand S22 line may have some facial recognition capability but not sure if app‚Äôs will permit the feature for password authentication.	N

I truly appreciate owning both the Fold 3 and S22u	"About a month ago, I had the itch to get the S22u for a few personal reasons such as helping improving typing, a better camera for travel and a large single screen for easy access. Having said that, I'm SO glad I didn't trade in the Fold 3 because I'm typing on it now as it quickly became my night time phone along with weekends plus I still keep it in my work bag just in case I get the itch to switch during the day haha. I'll never say goodbye to the fold world but I have to say that both phones are absolutely amazing devices and I'm appreciative to own them simultaneously. Let's hope the Fold 4 has the S22u camera (or similar) as it would make the upgrade worth it to me hands down.

Best S22 Ultra Screen Protector?	"What is the best S22 Ultra Screen Protector, I purchased a film one, that worked well for a few days, but started lifting on the sides which in turn pulled debris/dust inside the actual film, adding air bubbles aswell, and literally only had the phone mostly in my pocket or on my desk. 
I'm very wary of screen protectors for edged phones, as I see a lot of reviews complaining that they begin to lift if they do not have a strong adhesive.
I only want a screen protector to prevent pocket scratches, as that's where my phone sits most of the time."	N

Seeing everyone say the backs super strong and never leaves markings, I'm prone to believe some are just defective? Maybe its just my luck but if JerryRigEverything could just scratch on purpose the back of his black S22U and leave no marks while I accidentally placing my keys on the back and it left a mark right away makes me believe that its just my luck.

Question about Protect Battery feature	"I've decided ro turn mine on an utilize it. It will stop charging at 85% like it days. But my question is would it be bad to leave it on the charger like it is to leave one on overnight at 100% charge? 
I wanna use this feature. But given how fast this phone seems to drain right now, I'm not too keen on. Just powering up to 85% 
If it WONT hurt it like leaving it on the charger at 100% can, then I'll use the feature and let it sit overnight so I don't lose our on further charge .  
Tomorrow my nephew graduates college so I'm going down there to see him walk,  so I will probably need it at full 100% to get me through the day tomorrow. It's a 3 hour ride to Tuscaloosa and I imagine the ceremony will take 4-5 hours given how many people there are down there. Plus sticking around to celebrate for a bit, I imagine it'll be well over 12 hours before getting back home and on charge."	N
Stock take: What color do you have?	My S22 is green and I absolutely love this color. With my case not in yet ,I'm being careful about setting it on hard surfaces.

Build Quality/In-hand feel compared to Note 10+?	"So I upgraded to the S21 Ultra a while back but kept my Note 10+ around as well. And while I am a huge fan of the Note series, and greatly miss my S pen, I have to say the heft and build quality of the S21 Ultra is just feels way better to hold. The Note 10+ is so light and thin that it feels like a toy now. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I definitely have my preference.
So now I am just wondering, how would you compare the Note 10+ to the S22 Ultra in terms of feel? Is it heftier/thicker etc? If you ignore the sharp corners, does it feel more like the Note 10+ or the S21 Ultra?"	N

It doesn't interfere with my TPU screen protector but I did read that it pushed up a glass screen protector in a Amazon review.
The clear back is a huge fingerprint magnet as expected.  It does sit flush when laid down on it's back.  There appears to be plenty of space around the camera cut out for lens protectors if that's your thing.

s22 ultra vs mirrorless cameras? (Sony a6400)	"Flagship phones nowadays have great focus speed and zoom plus their focal length making them see in low light. They can record 8k shoot 100s megapixels.

Front Camera: 60 fps looks fine, 30 fps looks bad	"I've been testing the S22 Ultra and there's some overprocessing going on in the front camera 4K30 mode.

Frame from a 4K30 video: [https://i.imgur.com/ppPrtgZ.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/ppPrtgZ.jpeg)
4K60 looks fine whereas 4K30 is too sharp. This is specially bad with faces and skin tones.
My guess is the native camera app is using the processing headroom to ""refine"" the video quality.
You see, the native camera app is almost perfect. The way you can change lens and zoom within the same video recording works wonders. I don't think any 3rd party app can do this.
But this overprocessing is terrible, it defeats all benefits."	N

Samsung needs to work on their haptics.	"I just switched back from my Pixel 6 Pro for a day, and I must say the haptics on that phone are steps ahead of the S22U. It almost feels weird not having haptics for the notification shade, or while multitasking, etc. The phone almost feels 'mechanical' in a way when navigating around. 
I do feel Samsung working on some haptics, like within the Device Care app, but it leaves me wanting more. I do hope that Samsung continues to improve their haptics in later versions of One UI."	N
UAG Monarch Kevlar case accessories?	"Just got the S22 Ultra, put on a UAG Monarch case (the one with the kevlar); purchased a spigen metal kickstand because of another reddit post showing it fits in the bottom rear recessed area of the monarch case but I guess the kevlar version has different dimensions because it won't fit there.  
Anyway looking for recommendations for a kickstand and/or magnetic attachment that would fit on this case for kickstand capabilities as well as possibly holding it for gps from a car vent/popsocket mount etc.

Switching to Canadian Samsung Pay on US variant	I am Canadian, down in US this week. So I just picked up an s22 ultra unlocked variant, and transferred my accounts. Samsung pay won't let me activate my existing cards because it is asking for a zip code, and it won't let me type in a postal code. In fact the whole samsung pay app seems pretty different on this phone. Any ideas on whole to get around this? Do I need to flash to Canadian firmware?

Which case are you using? I got the official smart clear view case, and it's a total garbage and a ripoff for the price.	I really liked smart view case on my previous phone - S9 plus, which I bought in 2018, and it is holding up. But this case for S22 ultra feels much cheaper, it has a cutout instead of a semitransparent stylish plastic, and the dye has already started peeling off in 3 months of light usage.	N
Small grey bar appeared after restart. Cannot remove ?	"Had this near a week now, using swipe gestures. Phone died and did a restart, then this appeared.

It's properly annoying pulling that instead of what you intended to do.

Messaging question	"I'm using the Google app for messaging rather than the Samsung app, and when I want to send a picture of my dog and tap on the little photos icon it brings up Gallery rather than Google photos.

eSIM Card on Verizon	"I just got my new S22.  Before ordering, I confirmed with Verizon I could go to a local authorized dealer to program the eSIM card with my Verizon number.  So I scheduled an appointment and the guy working there looked like I had asked him to perform surgery.  He told me to call Verizon.
I get home, call Verizon and spend 2 hours spread between 4 reps all who can't help me.  They punch in the IMEI 2 (eSIM) number and it basically says it's a physical SIM card.  They keep trying the ""iPhone method"" and it keeps failing.  I keep telling them I've read online that process doesn't work, but they won't believe me.  I asked each if they had ever done a Samsung eSIM and none had.
Tomorrow the plan is to try to do it via chat (seems that's more successful) or otherwise head to a local Official Verizon Store.

Just bought it..do you find it overrated?	"So i just bought S22+ i loved the base one but knowing i had issues previously with s8 battery which i had to use power bank when I'm out and using google maps so i didn't want the risk, my current phone is A52s and im replacing it for better display and faster CPU and memory 
I have completed my 1st hour with s22+
The battery drops in a crazy way however i didnt do any optimization settings yet just transfering my files
While its less than 1mm wider than A52s yet when you hold it in same case brand nilkin you dont really feel comfortable operating with one hand
Games and graphics are way faster and better
Phone gets heated when you play (NFS and WW Heros
Youtube videos are better and overall better display than A52s but not that good compared to my old S8
Overall it's a good one but not that good and no woow effect (maybe no woow due to being 42 now i dont know..we get older and hard to be impressed)..does it worth double price compared to A52s..certainly not !!"	N

Is my fingerprint sensor disabled?	"Hi, I recently purchased the s22+ and I'm a little confused about the fingerprint sensor. I know it's supposed to be built into the screen somewhere but I either can't seem to find it, or it's deactivated maybe? 
When I tried to set up fingerprint recognition, there was no indicator showing me where to put my finger, so I pressed all around the screen, but couldn't find it. I watched some videos on it, and they all had some sort of indicator near the bottom of their screens.
Is there some setting I should enable first? 
Sorry if this has been asked already, but i did a quick search and didnt see anything that quite described my issue. Any help would be appreciated.
Edit: I got it to work. I booted into safe mode and opened settings&gt;biometrics and security&gt;fingerprints and after a few seconds i was able to add my fingerprint. I know u/b1gmouth suggested recovery mode. I'm not sure if there's a difference between that and safe mode but I used safe mode"	N
Ordering During Promotions from Samsung Online	"Not ordering Samsung anymore and I would advise anyone that does order during their promotions to inquire prior to ordering whether the promotion is still on or not. They have right to terminate the promotion at any time.
Prior to ordering, I contacted live chat to ask them whether the buds pro would be delivered with my order of the S22 Ultra. They said yes and stayed on the chat waiting for me to complete my order. The chat never specified that the colour I ordered was not part of the promotion, nor was it stated on the website. They also never specified that the promotion ended early due to not having any supply. So I placed the order on April 3 because the promotion was still going until April 3 or 4. The promotion was still displayed on the order page when I placed the order.
I contacted them today to inquire why the buds pro was not included in the items being shipped to me. They said the promotion ended April 1 and they quoted me that Samsung reserves the right to do so bit. I argued against that claim. Then they also stated my colour was not included in the promotion.
I get that they have the right to end the promotion and they may have specified it, but at least they could have told me while ordering and take off their promotion off the website. Never ran across anything like this so it has opened up my eyes."	N

Samsung S22 - eSIM Card Activation is a PITA	"I'm just giving a warning to anyone trying to use the eSIM card on a Samsung phone, specifically the new S22 series.  Expect it to be a pain in the ass if purchased from another vendor.
I bought an unlocked S22 from Google.  Samsung has decided not to release that IMEI # to the world.  Their chat support basically told me to wait until NEXT QUARTER to use my eSIM card.
The truth is that the eSIM card does work.  You need to call Verizon or Chat with Verizon and tell them you need to setup your eSIM card.  If it doesn't immediately show up in their system, INSIST on having it go to the next tier technical support.  The next level technical support does something (calls Samsung or simply creates the profile themselves) in their system, which will allow you to use your eSIM card.
To be clear, this is a problem created by Samsung and made worse by Verizon.  Do not listen to CSRs who try to figure out the problem.  They cannot fix your problem if the IMEI # doesn't show in their system.  It needs to be done by a higher level employee.  You're simply wasting your time by talking to them any further.
I've gone to 3 Verizon stores, spoken with 3 CSRs, and chatted with 1 CSR and 1 manager.  Do not waste your time like I have.  I personally recommend the chat over the phone.  I had a much more pleasant experience over chat, but I'm sure that's hit or miss."	N
Galaxy S22 Upgrade Advice	I have a 3 line Magenta Max plan. I want to upgrade 2 lines from Galaxy S20 to Galaxy S22 and Galaxy S22 Ultra.

S21Fe uses exynos while S22+ uses snapdragon.

It's not worth upgrading from an S21+ to an S22 Ultra, right?	"My local Verizon store has a black 256GB S22U in stock, and I'm seriously looking at getting it. But I have an S21+ that I got about three months ago, and it's perfect. I love it. It's a great phone.
But here's the thing: I want to keep whatever phone I have for a few years. I want a phone that will last, which to my mind generally means getting the best version of the latest phone that I can afford.
That, now, is the S22U, 256GB, in black.
But my current phone is so new (it's about 3 months old) that it seems dumb to upgrade. 
I'm a phone whore, so I can't really decide what to do here. I'm looking for objective opinions from people who don't care (lol). I asked my wife and she said, ""If you want it, get it."" lol. I love her, but that's not helpful at all to someone like me who loves buying new phones and is trying to be responsible about it for the first time in his life.

WHERE IS THE MAY 2022 SECURITY PATCH SAMSUNG??	My unlocked s22 ultra is suffering from annoying and frustrating bugs I've never experienced before on previous Galaxy flagship devices, and since the May 2022 update has bug fixes I need that now!!

I got the S22 Ultra and I still have my S20 Ultra with me if that's anything to consider.Edit: Got poweramp to finally scan my micro SD card for all my music, I just had to do the "full scan" option, but I still hope there's some way to use Samsung music since it was a lot easier to navigate, else I'll just have to move all my playlists to poweramp.

Battery Life of S22	Hi,It is now more than a month since I bought the Samsung S22. The adaptive battery feature is on. Have kept most apps on not to be used in background mode except office apps which are critical.The battery life continues to be very bad. I had the Samsung S20 before this and the battery used to last a full day. With S22 - I have to charge second time by early evening and that becomes very inconvenient as access to time and charger is an issue during the day. Have faced situation atleast 5 times in the last one month when the battery runs out during the day keeping me disconnected at critical times.Initial inputs was that adaptive battery will learn, but it is now more than 40 days and there is no improvement or learning.Please advise any remedy - on the verge of treating this buy as sunk cost and moving out of Samsung as S22 Ultra is just too bulky for my needs.

Samsung rep admits they are trying to rip me off	"Thought this was interesting. Was all set to buy a new S22 Ultra direct from Samsung last night, trading in my N20U. Got to the ""pay me"" page and was kind of surprised to see them wanting to charge me $135 in tax on a $399 purchase. So I started the following chat session. Lines that start indented are the rep's responses. 
Makes it kind of hard to do business with them when they admit to ripping me off! Does anyone know how to get around being overcharged for taxes like this when working a trade with Samsung?

Hello and thanks for visiting Samsung.com!  
Mobile support sent specific content you can only see in chat  
Question before I buy  
We‚Äôre happy to help! One sec while I check our experts‚Äô availability...  
Hi! You're with an Expert now.  
Hello, Welcome to SamsungÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ. I am Abhishek your Pre-sales Expert let me help you with the best experience with Samsung today. May I know your Name to serve you better.ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ  
I am trying to place an order for an S22 Ultra. Subtotal is $399.99 but tax is $135.85!! Why is the tax so high?     Okay I understand that no worries I will assist you for this till the last step.  
As I want to let you know that the Tax is may vary form state to state also it depends on the government  
Samsung does not charge you for the tax also Samsung provide you the free shipping on the product  
That's true. But no state has 30%+ sales tax.  
Tax should be around $38. So it's $100 too high.  
As I want to let you know that also your tax will be counted on the device on the original price of the product that tax will not count that you are trading any device if there is any discount form the company so it may not counted in the tax.  
Because goverment apply tax on the market price of the device  
No they don't. If I trade in a car on a new car, I only pay the tax on the difference. Same thing here.  
I understand that but I also do not have rights for this that I can change it  
Well, I'm not going to be overcharged for taxes. Is there someone that can adjust this to the correct amount?             I understand that but Samsung does not charge you for this. No it can be corrected non of my colleague can adjust this amount  
Samsung is charging me for this. I'm on Samsung's website buying a Samsung product.  
I know they have to remit the tax to the state, but they are not going to over remit either.  
I understand that but I also do not have rights and access for this as the cart gets build and we move to make the purchase so it shows the value of the cart  
Due to which it is system generated and also we are not able to change it.  
So the customer is just suppose to put up with being ripped off because the system has a bug?   Yes that is correct I hope I would be able to do anything in this.  
But the tax amount can not be changed  
Also if you select the instore pick up it will take the tax  
LOL! Well, at least you're being honest that your system is ripping me off. Wow.  
There are no stores near me.  
I understand that I am putting my self on your position due to which I am able to understand you in this."	N
Back up Data/Factory reset	"I know how to perform both. This is what I need help understanding. 
If I back up my phone to my Google account that saves my data, settings contacts etc etc. 
If there is malware or anything bad in my phone... Does it stay on the phone or will I inadvertantly transfer it in the back up.? 
Google one said NO it is protected. 
If this is on fact true then I should be able to restore the back up onto the phone AFTER I perform a factory reset. And I should not have any issues with having transferred anything bad back into my phone. 
Does this sound correct? 
Basically means anything bad in the phone is just that... In the phone! And NOT in my data. Correct?
Thank you"	N

Why is it cheaper to get the S22 Ultra from eBay compared to the US online store? Also is their any reason on going for the 512gb storage option?	I am still trying to decide whether or not on getting the S22 Ultra or the Pixel 6 pro, but I am slightly leaning toward the S22 Ultra since it supports dual physical sims.

When I'm using the my phone, the screen dims after 30s of inactivity.  This isn't the screen turning off (that setting is working as desired), it's a drastic drop in brightness.  I'd like to extend that time because I work off reference photos/do other things that need longer screen on times.
When I Google the issue all I get are suggestions to turn off adaptive brightness, which if I understand that correctly is meant to adjust the main brightness setting depending on the environment.  That's a feature I love and want to keep using.
Any ideas? Is this doable?
Thanks in advance.
edit - I possibly found a workaround, setting the actual screen timeout for much longer than I'd like seems to increase the timeout before dimming. That's going to help, but I'd still love to hear if anybody knows about an option to adjust the dimming timeout specifically."	N

Came back to S22 Ultra after 6 days	"Thought some of you might enjoy the story. Been a Galaxy user since 2016. I just upgraded to the Galaxy S22 Ultra a couple weeks ago but my sales person said If I ever changed my mind I had a couple weeks where I could change to another phone for $35. 
About a week later I was tempted with all the iPhone stuff and thought I'd give it a try since I used to have an IPhone since high-school. I paid and got the 13 pro max. Had it for exactly 6 days and brought it back and asked if I could switch back to galaxy. Luckily the store still had my original Ultra I traded in and it was a swap back to the device I originally owned that they hadn't sent back yet. 
Samsung just felt so much more at home to me and everything iPhone felt like petting a dog backwards against the grain. Anyone else here flip flop and immediately come back?"	N

S22 Ultra is good for nothing ????	"So it looks like the S22 is just good for some nice 10X pics and nothing much to brag about??. This is what I see on this forums from most ppl, just putting some posts about some random picture of a bird or some building they took ??. Are they taking these pics to justify the phone OR they really needed to take those pics in real life??
Is there anything great about this phone other than improved 10X camera, compared to S21U ??
Edit-1: I have had galaxy phones since v1.0... Now have an S21+.. Returned the S22+ for being smaller and  battery size compared to S22. So was looking to see if S22U makes sense ( nice camera and 10X) but Just not getting the vibe to get this thing... The unneeded bulkiness/weight due to the fact that Samsung decided we all need a s-pen... is putting me off..

I was able to get a 5h35m SOT on my S22 by disabling Google Play Services	"I'm sure I'm not the only one disappointed by the battery life of the S22. I used a Huawei P40 before this phone, and while I love most aspects of the S22, I can't help but compare a lot of things between the two handsets. Most notably the battery life. I only charge my P40 once per day, usually when I arrive at work.
Having used a phone without Google Mobile Services, I have gotten used to not using Google apps on my phone. With the S22, I found that I still don't really have much use for GMS. I also noticed that I could be using Instagram for an hour, and the Google Play Services would still be at the top of the battery usage list. So I decided to just disable Google Play Services. Naturally, everytime I open an app that relies on Google, I get an error. Though most of the apps I use don't have this error, or would display the error but still work. I think I will still keep this disabled unless I need an app that requires it.
Since I charged my phone to 100% yesterday, I was able to get 5h 35m of screen on time and 14h 12m screen off time, with 20% remaining."	N
WhatsApp call crashes/issues	"Hi all,
I am facing issues with WhatsApp calls. If I try to call someone, the app immediately crashes. I've found out that the call does come through, sometimes even with a 10 minute delay. However, I don't see that on my phone, but the receiver will get a delayed incoming call and won't hear anything at all.
This is not the biggest issue: the app also crashes when I receive WhatsApp calls. Everytime the app crashes, I know someone tried to call me. However, I can't see who (no missed call or so appears). This bug is really annoying. I tried the following things to solve this:
- Update phone (Base S22 Exynos, running Android 12 OneUI 4.1 April update)
- Update WhatsApp (App version 2.22.9.78)
- Restart phone
- Clear WhatsApp cache
- Clear WhatsApp data
- Reinstalled WhatsApp
- Factory reset phone
- Tried different networks (both Wi-Fi and cellular)
- Disabled all power restrictions for WhatsApp
- WhatsApp has been granted all permissions
I contacted WhatsApp support regarding this issue, but they seem not be very willing to help: I always get the same response to use other networks and to reinstall WhatsApp. Furthermore, once the app crashes, I can send a Feedback Report to Google. However, once I click this button, the Feedback application also crashes. I'm therefore not able to send this error as well.
I have searched for similar problems, but I didn't find any recent posts. I hope that someone facing this issue is able to help me out, or that anyone may have any suggestions for me to solve this issue. Thanks in advance!"	N

Buy S21 Plus or Base 22?	"Hi Everyone,
I'm a bit confused about which phone to buy.

Base S22 (Snapdragon) 128gb - ‚Çπ 67999  (\~$884)
I need a phone with decent battery life and performance considering I'm spending so much money: The Phone is connected to galaxy watch 4 and bluetooth earphones as I run/workout a lot so I use mobile data (4g) to stream music like 4 hours a day. 
I've heard that base S22 Snapdragon variant battery isn't good and people barely get 4 hours of SOT (on mobile, not wifi) but the performance, screen, camera, etc. are good.
I've heard bad things about S21 Plus Exynos variant like overheating, freezing issues, low SOT after an year, camera issues, etc.
Can users who own or have used either of the phones recommend which phone to buy considering their price difference? S22 plus and S21 ultra are &gt;$1,000 so that is out of my budget. Thanks in advance."	N

s22 for 860$ or p6p for 1100$?	" The s22 includes 2 years of data for 860$ whereas for the p6p I'd need to pay 860$ for the phone + 240$ for data (1100$)
I'm kinda torn between s22 and p6p because s22 is way cheaper, but p6p seems to have way better image quality at high zoom numbers: [https://youtu.be/QjzYsLOyV\_0?t=83](https://youtu.be/QjzYsLOyV_0?t=83)
I like taking pictures of clouds and shit so the zoom would be nice. This is the main reason I haven't just bought the s22 yet.
Here are some other factors that make it harder to decide too:
* s22 seems to have a better selfie camera (lower fov)
* p6p seems to have better stabilizing
* I saw someone mention that p6p has a lot of bugs related to calls and other things, is this still the case?
I'd really appreaciate any tips! Are there any other phones I should consider with good zoom in this price range?"	N

USB cable question re: Samsung Dex	"So I accidentally discovered Samsung DEX by trying to charge my S8 with the USB-C cable from an intelligent laptop dock device.  All of a sudden Samsung DEX popped up on the monitor connected to the dock ***and my life hasn't been the same since!***  
(I was also happy to see that it continues to work with the S22 too.)
Anyhow, it turns out that the capabilities of the cable matter.  I wanted a longer cable to connect the phone with the docking station.  The dock came with a little 3-footer.
Turned out that the thin little Samsung charging cable that came with the phone did NOT work, though it was able to charge the phone.
I ended up rolling the dice on a third-party cable that claimed ""HMDI"" and ""4K"" compatible.  Those did work.
I'm wondering what is the official specification for the cable such that it can do this (in case I want more).
And related, what is missing from the original Samsung cable that stopped DEX from working."	N

Just about done with this phone- S22 ULTRA	"S22 ultra base 8gb RAM model. SOT of 2hrs 10min and I'm down to 43% from 100%! I feel like I just took the phone off the charger. Antutu scores are abysmal at 644873 currently with the worst being below 500000! Screen lag/stutter constantly. Bought directly from the Samsung website. I feel like I have a cheap knockoff or something. Wife has the new iPhone 13 pro max and she can go almost 30hrs on a single charge! I've seen it personally. Not to mention the back of my phone feels like plastic compared to the pro max back. I may actually turn apple, atleast for the next year. Samsung dropped the ball this year IMO
UPDATE: Just got done factory resetting my device and letting it charge to 100% no previous apps downloaded from before. All bare bones. I ran the antutu benchmark and got a score of 850000+! I know this phone can reach must higher than that but I am happy that my scores are more in line with the phone I have. It's been an hour since the reset and haven't noticed any lag or jitter. Will monitor my battery throughout the day and post an update on that later tonight. SOT before the reset was 3hrs 30min with only 18% remaining today
Battery UPDATE: Took factory reset phone off the charger at 2:14pm today, it is 9pm same day at the time of this edit. Current SOT is 4hrs 28mins. Battery percentage is 34% so not great but an improvement nonetheless. As stated below in comments my phone had a SOT of 3hrs 30min with just 18% left pre factory reset. Will give the battery a week to learn usage patterns again and maybe give another update here. Leaving this for future reference if someone is having same problems as me, maybe follow what I did. One thing I've seen a massive improvement on is my phone's performance. It is 3x better now than it was earlier in the day before reset. Also antutu score now reads 940000+ which is what the s22 ultra is fully capable of! Really excited!"	N

Galaxys22ultra samsung pass not working?	Hello, I just got the S22 ultra yesterday and I'm in the process of setting all my stuff up. Including samsung pass.The first problem is its not even in my app drawer. I have to search it on the app store just to find it. It says installed but that and the search bar are the only way I can find it.The second is when I go to sign in I can get all the way to the screen to verify my finger print and it tells me try again later can't verify.I've already set up my security setting and biometrics on the phone setting itself so I'm not sure what I'm missing .I've done the clear cache and date restarted my phone. Turned off and on. Still nothing.	N
Original Galaxy S22 Ultra cable power support	I would like to know if the cable that comes with the Galaxy S22 Ultra supports 45W charging, or if only the cable that comes with the 45W Charger has power support.I ask this because I bought the 35W charger from Samsung and the charging time is exactly the same as the Original 25W charger, now I don't know if it's a limitation of the device or if it's the cable I'm using (I only have the original that came with the S22 Ultra ).Solved!Go to Solution.

Make One UI home finder pop up keyboard?	One UI home, should have a option to pop up keyboard automatically when you swipe to the app drawer or swipe down to open finder. I don't know why Samsung does not add this. They added in good lock home up to swipe down to bring up finder. However it doesn't pop up the keyboard? What is the purpose of having to click the text box at the top of the screen? The iphone spot light has this feature and so does the pixel phones. Please add this Samsung.	N

S22 Ultra - False moisture/debris alert issues?	Hello,Looking for help with the moisture/debris notification on the S22 Ultra. I have had the phone less than a week, moving from a S10+. As part of that move I also carried over from my S10+ a magnetic USB-C charge adapter which is QC4.0 rated (9v 2a/5v 3a) that I only use in the car for convenience with android auto (could care less if it charges the phone or not). I always charge my phone via an Anker wireless charger.The magnetic adapter was never removed from S10+ since the day it was new until I moved it to the S22 Ultra. about 2 days later I got my first debris/moisture warning in the middle of a work day while my phone had been untouched sitting on my work desk for over an hour prior to the message. My office is environmentally controlled at 72 degrees with 30% humidity. Considering the situation, I assumed maybe the magnetic adapter itself was dirty/old. No matter - I have a couple brand new heads for it. I popped one of those in and all was well. Three days later - I get another warning while my phone is sitting on the table in my living room - having been untouched for a while. My home is also environmentally controlled at 70 degrees with low humidity.Just to be clear - the cable was not connected to the magnetic tip during these messages (it's only used when driving). The exposed end of the magnetic tip has no debris in/on it (it's flush and smooth so highly unlikely anyway).Is the magnet causing an issue? Are these kinds of adapters "not allowed" for some reason now?Also for reference, this isn't a cheap, no-name product either. The cable & magnetic adapter I use is by ChargeASAP and the variety is the UNO which is QC4.0 rated. They also make a 100W version with PD support, but like I said I use it exclusively for Android Auto in my car (with the tip living onside my phone 24/7).Any help or advice would be most appreciated.Thanks in advance.

Customizing.... What?	On 4/29 I decided to purchase an S22 Ultra. I did this through Samsung.com, as they offered a great trade in deal for my old device. I was given the option of a Black one in 512GB that would arrive on 5/3, or the exclusive Red one in the same size that would arrive on 5/10. I figured I could wait a week for the cool S Pen in red (the phone itself is going into a black Silicone case so does not really matter to me that it is red), so placed my order.Here is my question. I keep going back to the order to see its status, and it says Customizing. What exactly is being "customized" here? It is either in stock or it is not. I even saw the exact unit I purchased go out of stock a few days later, so not sure what they are customizing. It is not like they are going to the production line, and pulling a black unit, that they then pop the back off of, and then place the Red back on., and then taking the s pen apart to put the red shell on it. Checking online today, the 128GB version cannot be ordered (it is not in or out of stock, selecting this simply changes the selection to 256GB due to the free upgrade) 256GB is out of stock, 512GB is IN stock, and 1TB is out of stock. If they are truly customizing the device, as they claim, why can they not change the memory to any configuration.On a side note, on one of the times I used the order form to see if they were in stock, I noticed a disclaimer at the bottom that stated something to the effect of Please allow up to 5 additional weeks for the online exclusive colors. Why? Why is it so hard to take something that has been manufactured, so that it shows as available, and simply ship it?I also got a little worried on Friday (5/6) that it would not show up by the expected date, due to the fact that 4 days remained, and it had not billed/shipped yet. Saturday I got the lovely Unexpected Delay e-mail that states that they will ship it when they feel like it. Not when they promised, but whenever they get around to it.I really should have just gotten the black one, as this one did not need to be "customized" and was not in the 5 week inexplicable delay, that I was warned of, by them, but was completely unexpected, by them.

How to use USA variant S22 Ultra (Unlocked) in India	I am planning on buying an S22 Ultra from the USA but want to know whether or not it'll work in India. I have read that even the unlocked models need to be activated using a US SIM for 30 minutes. Also there have been some statements regarding the usability of Samsung Pay and Samsung Pass in non native country. Since both USA and India will be getting Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 wouldn't it make things easier? Please provide some help regarding this issue, especially people who have bought USA variants in the past and used in India, like many people do for the iPhones.	N

Change voicemail app on S22 Ultra	Hello,I just purchased a new S22 Ultra on Xfinity Mobile.

Apps for older android version	"Can someone help me understand this.?  
First of all our apps auto update so they should be updated.

So how'd they get there? And better yet why can't they be uninstalled. I don't understand.  
1 ... Samsung notes add ONS 
NEVER HEARD OF IT. 
notes yes
Add ONS... Huh uninstalled after warning blah blah 
2... Live weather. Heard of it, don't use it. Why is it on my phone? Not even the pre installed cheesy Samsung weather can't uninstall 
3 live transcribe... Next heard of it don't need it can't uninstall 
I think I am going to do a factory reset and go thru the painstaking one by one install 
I can't find a reason why my screen still glitches. I was told to put the screen on vivid it would stop. If was already on vivid setting.   
So after looking even further this is pre-installed but it's for an older version so why is it pre-installed in my phone if it's an older version that's retarded and the picture says that it needs Bluetooth scan all kinds of Bluetooth stuff it's for notes why does it need to scan Bluetooth why does it need a nearby devices why does it need these things that doesn't make sense to me more Samsung garbage I'm sure Attachment 344688"	N

If your Samsung Galaxy S22(Or any other android device) is lagging, uninstall TikTok.	"I downloaded tiktok yesterday just to see someones profile and my device started to lag randomly. While scrolling in every app and even on the homescreen.
I looked through open processes to see if I had gotten a virus or if it was caused by some system application. I then saw 2 TikTok processes open and got suspicious. I instantly deinstalled TikTok and my device was judt as smooth as before. I would have never guessed that it was caused by an app I downloaded.
I wouldn't be suprised if it has malware hidden in it because of how it lagged my phone with only opening it once and after a restart will run in the background without opening it.
It is so badly coded when using it in a browser. Then they ask you every moment they can to download their app. App doesn't have bugs and has other features thay browser edition doesn't have. This is a great way of getting malware into millions of phones."	N

How to Turn off 5G.	"This is for people who don't want to, or can't use the third party apps to disable 5g. 
After going back and forth with AT&amp;T and Samsung, I had a guy who finally got me a fix.
so essentially the carriers block the user from changing the settings in the menu. I explicitly bought an unlocked s22 ultra to avoid this, but it seems AT&amp;T pulled the wool over my eyes.
But being the absolute rebel that I am, I found a fix that I will now share with you lovely people. I also chose this route because I don't trust 3rd party apps for this kinda stuff.
COMPLETE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK!! IM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU MESS UP YOUR PHONE OR ANYTHING ELSE YOU CHOOSE TO DO.
1. Close all open apps and turn off wifi, then open Samsung notes so you can make a note of some information later.
2. Open the dialer, and Dial ##4636## (redddit wont let me put stars, but it's Star#star#4636#star#star)this will open a phone options menu that is normally hidden. If you get an error code saying something along the lines of ""this code doesn't work"" go to step 2a, if it does open the menu go to step 3.
2a. While your phone is powered on, remove your Simcard.
2b. Dial the code again. The menu should pop up now. Do not reinsert your sim yet!
3. Select: Phone Information"" you'll then see a list of phone features and information.
4. Go down to Set preferred Network Type. Make a note of what the default selection is in your Samsung notes, or take a screenshot. DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP, YOU WILL NEED THIS INFORMATION EXACTLY AS IT APPEARS later on.
5. After you have made of note of the Default; if you removed your sim card you'll now want to reinsert your Simcard then wait a few seconds for the network to reconnect (you'll see the signal bars reappear). If you did not remove your Sim, move to step 6.
6. Change the selection for Set Preferred Network Type to the exact same option as default, EXCLUDING the option NR. So if your default was NR/LTE/GMS/CMRS, you want to change it to LTE/GMS/CMRS. (this is only an example and might not match your phone's settings exactly). These are the network codes, NR=5g LTE=4g, etc
The 5G indicator next to the signal bars at the top of the phone should now be gone, and that indicates you have disabled 5G.
You can always set it back to default later on if needed.
Also, in response to people asking about which option to pick when selecting the new bands. if you don't pick the option with the same choices as default (excluding NR) you might have difficulty calling 911 in low reception areas or places with no signal on AT&amp;T (or whatever carrier you have). This also applies to the Apps that turn off 5g as well. which is another reason I did this manually."	N

1) I haven't ""extracted"" value of the phone but owning it just a a year or so (got it on launch day)

New to Video Recording	"Good morning, 
I got the S22 Ultra at launch, and started to play around with the camera. I started using the phone for little things around the school I teach at, and recently purchased a mic to get even better quality for student interviews. I want to step up a little and try some new things, so I was thinking of buying a gimbal, but it seems that with my current case (Otterbox defender) and the relative newness of the phone, no one seems to approve anything. I watched two videos, one about the Powervision S1, and one on the zhiyun smooth 5. The smooth 5 seems to block the usb-c port but universally loved, and the Powervision I know I would have change cases (probably for both actually). Any guidance on this would be greatly appreciated. 
For some clarity, I'm mainly using this for school functions (i.e. dances, graduation, awards ceremonies) but some documentary shots would be cool and I want a smoother zoom technique. So maybe I don't even need a gimbal, and if not, do you recommend something else. Thank you and hope for some minor direction."	N

S22 plus battery life, SD variant, as a light user	"Just wanted to share my battery life as a S22+ user, SD variant. 
Battery life has been very good for me as a light user. The first 2-3 weeks were barely lasting 24 hours off chatger. Now I can easily get almost 48 hours off charger without a problem. 
Came from a zflip3 which would only last me 25ish hours off charger. 
I did do a smart switch from zflip3. 
Just a few of my tips that noticed improvement in battery life:
1. Auto optimization- I do 3 auto restarts during the week and optimizing.
2. Not using 5G, at least at work, has helped tremendously as 5G in ohio is trash.
3. Turning off google assistant voice detection, and deleting all unwanted apps has helped
4. Clearing google play store cache helped. (I had high play store draining in the beginning, plenty of YT vids on this)
5. Bixby routine to use wifi at home, mobile data still on
6. Disabling wifi scanning and precision location. Approximate works fine for me. 
7. I do use adaptive battery as I am a light user, but no stutters between apps whatsoever. 
Hope this helps yall. Just wanted to give my 2cents 
Love this phones feel on the hand. Didn't realize how much I missed a flat screen until I picked up a demo device at BB when first released and haven't turned back since!

(Please don't add troll options)
Has to be protective enough for care free use, I usually find that good dual layer cases deliver on this part (doesn't need to be a tank). 
Has to be grippy, not only in hand but preferably also so it won't slide if standing it leaning against something.
Has to be durable. Should be able to use it for years. 
Color shouldn't fade, I've had spigens with plastic only colored on the outside, the color stripped off after a while. 
Shouldn't yellow, so most / all clear cases are out. 
Shouldn't break and no flimsy parts (kickstands, thin plastic parts).
Don't want to throw away an entire case because of stupid reasons like these. It's wasteful.

Switch from Oneplus 8T to S22 Exynos?	"TL;DR: Is it worth it? I'm not a heavy user, no gaming, just some light Instagram/Reddit scrolling and using Maps driving to work.. Battery is my biggest concern seeing (mixed) comments on here :) I know that S22+ has bigger battery, but the price difference is too big maybe.
Hey y'all! I'm reading lots of posts and comments in this thread, but I'm not sure what to do. I have 8T with custom ROM, using GCam so photos are better than original OnePlus camera. But I'm looking for a better camera for more reliable and overall better photo and video experience without giving a ton of money. OnePlus doesn't have this more budget flagship version anymore and I don't mind having a more compact phone since I game on consoles and stopped gaming on my phone. I'm in Europe so I'd get the Exynos model, used to own S10+ Exynos but traded it for 120Hz and some other stuff I liked on OnePlus. Is it worth it? I'm not a heavy user, no gaming, just some light Instagram/Reddit scrolling and using Maps driving to work.. 8T doesn't have a wireless charger but it has 65W, I guess I wouldn't mind using wireless charging sometimes in the day if I get a better camera in return."

screen protector - careful installation resulted in silverish circles on screen itself due to tool	"hi there - i was putting a new screen protector on - replacing the one the unit shipped with and when using the tool with felt or whatever on it when applying to the top half there's like little bubbles on the screen itself now - anyone else had this?
I was quite delicate and this has happened - anyone else also experience this? guessing this is a need for a replacement unit? 
seems hard to believe that permanent damage could be caused by gentle smoothing over with the screen tool to adhere it to the phone screen but here we are"	N
S22 series features brought down to the S21 series: Auto-framing and improved Night Portraits	Who else here has updated to the May security patch and received camera feature upgrades? I think Auto-framing works well (in landscape, so far. The feature is somehow not working in portrait orientation) for practical uses. I haven't tried Center Stage to be able to compare the two but seeing Samsung's implementation of the feature through software updates makes me appreciate Samsung bringing down these newer features to older phones. And being optimized through OneUI. Unlike iPhones where newer camera features are usually not brought down to previous phones due to hardware limitations (??? ü§î) (with the exception of some software updates too here and there). Night portraits too are more improved though edge detection is somewhat amiss.	N

S22 ultra in europe vs 13 pro max	"I‚Äôm planning on buying a new phone since my current one (iphone 11) freezes a lot and has overheating issues making it unusable in summer.
I was looking to choose between the iphone 13 pro max and the samsung galaxy s22 ultra. The thing is, I‚Äôve read a lot of negative things about the ultra online. Freezing/stuttering issues, bad performance and bad battery life. Apparently this is an issues with the processor that are put in s22 ultras here in europe.
Now I‚Äôm wondering, do these problems still persist? And is it worth it to get the ultra over the 13 pro max?"	N

Call recorder feature is not available in my s22 ultra	The Samsung Galaxy S22 has a feature to record calls. This can be done manually or automatically.

'Mobile Data Always Active'	In Developer Options, there's an option to keep your data always active and I'm wondering if any of you keep yours on. I live and work in an area with shotty service and even my WiFi drops, thus causing my calls to also drop when it switches off my WiFi back to 4 or 5G.

Not happy	Can I return my phone and get an apple product.?	N
Shall I upgrade??	I have honestly put off upgrading my current phone for a couple reasons. Most recently the lack of the huge memory availability. But, I currently have the Samsung Note 20 Ultra 512 gig version with 512 external micro SD card. When I was told that getting the terabyte S22 ultra would be almost impossible, and I might just need to accept the 512 version. I was like, that's silly, and a downgrade. Makes no sense. My biggest thing about uncertainty of upgrading, is the fact that you cannot utilize the micro SD. I actually prefer having the ability of a secondary memory source, because you never know when the main phone memory might crash. So I ask those in the forums, would upgrading to the S22 Ultra versus keeping the Note 20 Ultra be beneficial? And what benefits does one phone have over the other?? Prefer responses from those that have made this exact switch.	N

HDR Photo Bracketing App	I'm coming from <shudder> Apple, and there was an excellent app I had on the iPhone that would take bracketed photo's automagically. You could adjust the exposure range by different increments, take 3 or 5 bracketed shots, and even would allow for "focus bracketing" that would automatically take photos at different focus points. The app was called "CameraPixels". I'm wondering is there an app for my S22 Ultra that will do the same thing? The camera on the S22 Ultra is an amazing piece of machinery, although I don't see how to automatically bracket a series of photos, without doing it manually, so any help along these lines would be appreciated.Thanks in advance.Solved!Go to Solution.

Certain "older" galaxy devices getting S22 camera capabilities wit the next May update	"I hardly consider the S20 series ""older"" as they still hold up quite favorably to the S22 line, and in some areas actually have the advantage. 
But with this month's next update, devices like the S20 series and a couple other lines are getting updates to the camera software that are currently found on the S22 line. 
It seems Samsung is really making a solid effort to future proof a lot of their devices. I put this in the S20 thread even though it has updates for other Samsung phones since there isn't a forum dedicated to ""Samsung in general"" 
This update applies to the S20 series, Note 20 series, Galaxy Z Fold 2 and Galaxy Z Fold 3.  https://www.phonearena.com/news/sams...hones_id139985"	N

I'm kinda dissapointment with my s22ultra's night capabilities for the main and ultra wide especially in comparison to my vivo x60pro plus	So i just got my new s22 ultra and it's amazing in all ways except when it comes to night and low to extreme low light scenarios. Where for both the video and photo aspect my x60 pro plus just is better in noise sharpness maybe the colour might be a little off yes but overall its more than just a subtle increase in quality. And i don't know if this is a temporary problem or just permanent that's how it's made. Cause tbh if i go to manual settings and tweak everything manually let's say keep both camera at same iso and shutter speed i prefer my ss22 ultra just by a little but on auto it's leagues apart.	N

The louder I turn the volume, the worse the sounds get, sounds like a 100$ phone, can't listen to more than 80% volume cause it gets too bad after that.
No idea what caused this issue (just got the May security update a day before but I guess that's unrelated). Either way, what should I do now, (how) can I get a replacement unit?

Get S22Ultra Exynos or iPhone?	"I haven‚Äôt had the need to buy a phone in the last 6 years as my LG G6 ran amazing, but it‚Äôs now on its deathbed and I am looking to replace it with something that is significantly better. I have made a list of pros and cons but even with this I cannot decide:
- Pros: Android experience, amazing display and cameras, s-pen (i draw a lot and could also do it on the go), will be able to keep my google play store purchases.
- Cons: I only have the Exynos variant available to me and i have seen the difference in photos. The night ones are the worst offenders, since I mostly go out at night and take photos. Big battery but how is it still worse than apple?
One of the biggest cons I have against apple is my unwillingness to enter their ecosystem as I already have an iPad and was hoping to keep my operating systems separate for phone, tablet and laptop. Plus their app store is so lacklustre compared to android but I feel like i shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for a worse version of an S22U just because i will miss a couple apps :/"	N

S22 Ultra terrible battery life! (Possibly fixed!)	So I was getting horrid battery life for over a month.

I'm now at 50% after 20 hours and 3 hours SOT. So I think the culprit was my auto brightness. I think it glitched out somewhere along the line because I've noticed my brightness seems to be way lower when it should be. It seemed to never drop below 30-40% brightness before reset.

Help Solve Low-Resolution in S22 Photos! Human/Animal Subjects Captured with Rear-Facing Cameras	Hi, Samsung Community, I hope someone here can help me resolve a startling issue on my 3-week-old Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra: oddly low-quality resolution (e.g., blurriness, pixelation, and oversaturation), on photos of human/animal subjects captured with the rear-facing camera lenses.Firstly, I want to emphasize that I am neither the most tech-savvy nor the most skilled photographer; I lack the digital literacy to fully utilize the (INCREDIBLE) power of this machine and wholeheartedly acknowledgemy issue may stem from user error. After all, the quality of the photographer/user's know-how often informs the quality of their experience with a device. üòâ However, if I'm on an adventure with family or kitty with multiple subjects from plants to foods to people to landscapes, I need to know I can rely on the camera‚Äôs default settings and point-and-shoot system to grab a photo better than what the photos attached (startlingly lower quality than what my Samsungs in the 2010s captured). Bells/whistles like Portrait mode may capture out-of-this-world shots, but only in situations where one KNOWS they are exclusively shooting a human subject and don't need to quickle toggle among modes. With that in mind, please be kind and bear with me if my elementary "Explain It Like I'm 5" language reflects my, well, elementary tech literacy!!!Okey dokey, let's dive into a headspin that I‚Äôm terrified has no fix! I am a loyal Android user (no Apple mobile devices to date!) who upgraded from a Galaxy S8 to the S22 Ultra in late March after extensively carving through forums and weighing the pros/cons of the iPhone 13 Pro (would have meant upgrading to the Apple ecosystem for the first time ever!!!) versus the glorious Samsung S22 Ultra. As a teacher who studies/works in the outdoors when not spending my limited free time with my cat / loved ones, my ONLY priorities for a phone in order of greatest to least importance are 1) having one of the best possible but user-friendly cameras on the market for amateur nature/family photography, and 2) being able to call and text with said camera (e.g., a PHONE), and 3) some bells/whistles that might enhance my daily productivity. I eventually decided that the S22‚Äôs arguably unmatched camera capacity, combined with the Note-like advantages of the SPen, beat out the iPhone 13 Pro by a landslide.Enter the problem (photos below -- note quality of faces): I've been giddy about my S22‚Äôs photo and video quality of landscapes and natural subjects, from mountain views to ephemeral wildflowers. Yet 9/10 times when photographing humans and my cat with the rear-facing cameras, the resolution is consistently poor (see attached!) unless taken within one foot of the subject. Selfies using the front camera do NOT suffer this issue, and while certain camera modes like Portrait with the rear-facing camera improve it, quality is still off and inferior to my S8 somehow. The quality is so low I wouldn't have guessed it was captured with anything but an early Galaxy, and old photos captured on my old S5 and S8 are comparatively LEAGUES AND BOUNDS better (e.g., capturing fine details like the Mordor-like amber flecks in my cat's eyes in even poor lighting, which the S22 cannot seem to do). I expected the S22 Ultra to achieve this and then some.Despite the $1000 price sticker, the S22 Ultra has thus far failed me (or I failed at taming this beautiful and advanced beast!!!) -- even during a visit with family I haven‚Äôt had the chance to see/hug since pre-COVID-19 (all our photos resemble flip-phone quality). I welcome any/all insights the Samsung Community may have! Below are the ways I‚Äôve tried to troubleshoot the problem thus far:Avoiding using the Zoom feature (.6, 3x, 10x, etc.) whenever possible, despite this being a major incentive beyond that high price sticker - No meaningful improvement of resolution noted. Also, it would be disappointing if one of the phone‚Äôs major bells/whistles (advanced Zoom) was totally unusable!Experimenting with photos with the SAME subject/lighting/etc. on all available sizes: [3:4 108 MP], [3:4], [9:16], [1:1], [Full]) - No meaningful improvementIncreasing screen resolution to WQHD_ (3088x1440) under Settings > Display > Screen resolution - No meaningful improvementExclusively taking photos in mediocre to high light (e.g., daylight) - No meaningful improvementTaking phots in "Pro" mode - Sometimes may or may NOT improve resolution, but is generally a pain in my a*s since I miss wonderful candid moments while scrambling to go to "More" > "Pro," especially if I want to transition back to a video quickly (have to go back to "More"Googling with no avail whether the problem derives from transitioning from an S8 to an S22 Ultra via Samsung Smart Switch (eg., Could fancy S22 features be diluted with the system's attempt to overwrite them with S8 quirks? Is that a thing??? Stupid question???????? I'm out of ideas?????)Various other explorations under Camera Settings!Grateful for all advice,E	N
Using the phone while charging	I've noticed that one S22 Ultra when I'm charging it and using it at the same time, it becomes slower. They keyboard especially. Is this just because I'm trying to use it and charge at the same time or do other people have this issue as well?	N
Samsung buttons	I don't want to use the TV remote button. Why does this **bleep** keep popping up to use??? **bleep** off Remote Control!	N
Expand Bixby features	I desperately need Bixby to adopt more capabilities of Cortana. For one, I need it to announce incoming texts, then ask what I want to do with them (reply, ignore) and follow that up with asking me for my reply. Also, Cortana worked FLAWLESSLY hands free in my car. Android/Bixby are virtually useless in the car. I could press the Call button in my car, say "call Cortana" and then give any hands free command I wanted. Similarly, no matter what mode my car stereo was in, any hands free action the phone would engage (like an incoming text) would behave like a phone call and interrupt the radio to announce the message... thus allowing me to interact. None of this is capable on Android/Bixby.	N
Where is the list of "optimized vs not optimized apps" in the S22 Ultra?	This was a list that I was able to access on some of my old Samsungs and Pixels. Now, I seem to only be able to find it on an individual app basis, which is really painful. Where is the big list at in the settings now?	N
Android Auto black screen Fixed	People with the s22 series of phones and use a pioneer head unit and have the black screen, the latest beta of Android auto has solved this issue for me. You can get the beta version from apkmirror.	N
Regretting size of phone	Anyone else just LOVE smaller phones then overnight decide they want a larger phone? Lol I ordered the s22 as it is smaller than my s21 but after using it wish I had ordered the ultra or plus. Lol even though I think I want a larger phone in reality I would probably get tired of using a behemoth of a phone.	N
Took my phone out of my pocket and saw an odd update screen pop-up out of nowhere. I could barely see the text on the screen but I could make out a bios-like appearance with a bar code at the bottom. See comments...	There was some text about not unplugging the USB during the update (wasn't even plugged in) and i could barely make out some Korean text. I restarted the phone and all was OK. Any idea what that was all about? I never authorized an update.	N

anyone else aint happy with their Galaxy s22 ?	"Hi,
So i had the galaxy s series for years, i have the 22 now for like 6 weeks, but is it just me or is the battery just REALLY bad?

Any other experiences like this ?"	N
Samsung s22 ultra review	"I don't know where else to post my review but here's the cliff notes.
I didn't upgraded my phone at the release but samsung recently offered 1k for the s21 ultra trade in.  I took advantage of this offer despite almost every review saying the phone is awful.
Ive had the phone now for a few days and I've had absolutely zero issues since transferring.  Obviously I'll come back and update this if need be but my battery life is better than my s21.  My speaker has been just as good and I've had no issues with anything else.
Not trying to sell anyone on upgrading just providing my experience if anyone else is considering the jump."	N
S22 vs Pixel 6 camera?	How does the S22 camera stand beside Pixel 6? Is it much worse? Did anyone buy S22 after Pixel so that you can tell if there are huge differences in camera? I really do not know what phone to buy and if S22 camera is really that much worse than Pixel 6	N
s22 ultra UltraWide camera not working	Hey guys I started having this problem with my phone for a couple days now. In the regular photo camera, 0.6 wide angle is not working whatsoever. Every other zoom is perfectly fine. My super steady option does the same where it just doesn't work and just blacks out.	N
The awesomely complex camera settings of the S22 Ultra	"The last time I had a Samsung was back in the S8 days. After using Pixel between then and now, I got used to the camera being pretty bare bones. The photos always turned out great, don't get me wrong, but there really was no customization or complex settings for their camera app.
The Samsung one is obviously different.
Does anybody have any general tips about the sheer number of settings? Or a video of somebody actually technically competent that explains them? All the ones I've found are just people reading through all the features, which isn't really helpful. I can clearly see it says 108 MP, obviously. I want to know the advantages and disadvantages of that, for example.
Same with all of the video resolution settings. There are a lot of them, a large mix of resolution, FPS, and which lens the camera is using. I'm used to either 4K @ 30 with UltraWide, or 4K @ 60 with no UltraWide. Those were my only options. Now, there are many more.
Any tips on this massive section of this phone?"	N
S22 ultra charger on Amazon?	"Hey there, looking for a good charger that may work well with other devices, as well as the S22 Ultras fast charging when I need it. 
My budget is around 45-50$. Whether that‚Äôs the Samsung 45w one, or a PPS charger that‚Äôs reliable. That‚Äôd be helpful. 
I understand it can wear on the battery, I wouldn‚Äôt be using it 24/7, but when I need to leave out the door in a quick rush in the morning - or when I forget to charge it.. and I‚Äôd like to experience some of the newer fast charging features. If anyone can recommend one that won‚Äôt overheat and work properly, that‚Äôd be super helpful."	N

Anyone else notice this camera change?	"Hi all. I've noticed recently a camera change and I was wondering if anyone else noticed the same thing? It's when operating the zoom and night mode.  
Before when operating the zoom or night mode,  you press the shutter and then a second or two later,  you would see the post processing applied. It's a noticeable difference between the immediate picture and then the post processed image.  
But now, you press the shutter button and the immediate unprocessed image remains. You don't see the post processing. When you click off the immediate image and click back on the same image in either the camera or gallery app, only then you see the final post processed image. As I say,  this is when operating in zoom or night mode.  
Has anyone else noticed this?"	N

Charging above 85% on Protect Mode	"Does anyone else have this problem?  
I have Battery Protect Mode enabled but when I leave my phone on a wireless charger I noticed that the battery level never drops below about 90%. It doesn't indicate that it's charging, but when I look on the battery screen is shows that it is charging slowly at that time.   
I thought the whole point was that it would only charge when the battery level was below 85%. I use my wireless charger as a stand when I'm working and that is why I've left the phone on it.   
Does anyone know how to troubleshoot it?

About the S23 &amp; S22	"People have been debating if they should buy the s22 or wait for the s23. The comments from what I've been reading are understandable but don't feel genuine at all.
S23 (ultra) will probably have:
- New ""stacking"" battery hardware, which will improve battery life &amp; capacity while remaining the same size
- UFS 4.0 storage. (Pretty much confirmed) Going from 2.0 -&gt; 3.0 was a huge performance boost. 4.0 will be about 2x faster. Power efficiency without taking a hit on battery performance
- 200MP. Which in itself is an upgrade over the last 3 generations &amp; probably will be the camera for the next 3 generations. But honestly not important enough to take into consideration.
Sales for the s22 has been good according to their numbers. Chip shortage might be annoying (increase in phone price and / or decrease in production). Mediatek rumors are most likely false and outdated rumors at this point.
Throttling, what an issue that has been. (And still is, since it only kicks in later now). I would be surprised if Samsung didn't learn a lesson here. A learnt lesson that they will apply in the S23 series.
Personally i have noticed that the S-line tries to make big improvements every 3-ish years. The S22 Ultra feels like a 'test' for what is to come over the next 3 year period. Meaning that going from S22 to the S23 will be a significant bigger jump than for example S20 -&gt; S21"	N

I heard if I do get a Snapdragon variant brought here to the UK I will be locked out a few things? Like for example 5G might not work, Samsung pay doesn't work and the warranty is weird?

I transfered my data and sent the cracked phone.... 1 week later...Message from a samsung tech:Your screen was cracked you need to Pay $175Called the e comerce deparment and they were Asking for prof of promotions and for prof of my selection.. for me this is simply something impossible to provide .. I don't go screenshoting my way while doing an order.. Any way....I received a message saying that if I don't pay my phone will be deactivated..

I¬¥m between S22 and S22+ but cannot decide due to phone size	Hello everyone,I have decided to jump into Samsung ecosystem coming from Apple. I have Iphone X with very little battery life and some dead pixels. I have gone to different samsung stores and thanks for this thread. I have some questions. A little background: I have Iphone X with very poor battery and I m thinking to go for the new Samsung.I can't decide which one to pick because of the screen size. My iPhone is 5.8inch and making the jump to the s22+ would be almost 1 inch. I have visited several samsung stores and I feel that the screen is too big and it will not be comfortable in my pocket. I would like to avoid the standard s22 simply because of its battery which, according to the reviews I saw, it s very poor.Is there anyone here who have made the jump from little screen to bigger?omeglexender	N
Galaxy S22 Not Really Fast Charging at 25W	Samsung, I upgraded from the S20 to the S22 hoping it would actually be an "upgrade" and so far the battery life is absolute dog and the "super fast charging" at "25 watts" is also not true. My S20 actually super fast charges very fast WITH a larger 400mAh battery, how does the S22 with a 3700mAh battery charge at 25W but it's twice as slow?? Are you slowing down the charging speed out of fears that the device would overheat?? Put out an update fix for this slow charging and also the battery life! Paying 700 for a flagship phone I expect flagship level performance. This is why a lot of your customers are going to Apple iphones!	N
galaxy s22+ short battery life ...	every time a new galaxy s comes out I get so excited that I forget that they don't add anything new to their phones last year the galaxy s21+ battery was 4,800 mah... this year the galaxy s22+ battery is 4500 mah. ..and it seems that it is 3,000 samsung is doing a horrible job with its batteries .... the cheapest range of samsung has 5,000 mah of battery how is it possible that the high range has less battery than the low range ... already this s22+ was the last samsung i bought... i'm going for iphone...

Nvidia gefore now	HelloI have a question for anyone who uses there s22 ultra for gaming on geforce now. Recently nvidia has unlocked the 120hz option for the s22 range.

But all the other models in the s22 range is. I'm also waiting on a reply from Samsung support.

S22 battery life	I seriously don't understand the people saying their base s22 has awful battery life. Look at my screenshot. Almost 7 hours of SOT with 27%left. It's actually better than my s21. So the people getting 3 or 4 hours either got duds or I lucked out and got an above average one. BTW I have only had it a few days and it's been like this since day one "even before the learning usage"anyone else getting amazing battery life on their base s22? Part of me thinks that maybe people who pre-ordered got units with issues but since google fi made me wait 3 weeks for a replacement (first package was empty either from them or fedex) and wasn't able to ship because they had to wait for samsung to send them more makes me think the units they are manufacturing now got any defects kinked out.	N
Bent SIM card	I've been battling no signal on this phone since day 1. When I say no signal I mean the Ghostbusters emblem next to battery percentage. No signal. I've been through 3 SIM cards and after new sim card the problem goes away for a week or two then returns. I'd put the sim card in my S21 Ultra and then it would also start having no signal issues when it never did before. Today I removed the sim card and I noticed it was cupped slightly. I'm wondering if the pins inside are applying too much pressure to the center and over time it cups the SIM card where then the signal goes out. I bent the sim card to where it's straight and now no issues. I thought I'd share my thoughts as it's been very frustrating. I love this phone but some days I have to restart phone 10 times then it works fine for 20 minutes and then starts acting up again. Anyone hear of phones bending sim cards? I noticed when I'd take the sim card out it never fit snug into sim tray and then when I'd get a new sim I'd tell Verizon rep and he'd say the new one fit snug to him which is more evidence the old sim cards had a bend to them and the new sim cards didn't.

The camera shutter lag vs "movement photo"	"Sorry if this is already known and I'm rambling but I did a quick search on Google about the shutter latency and found only people complaining about the performance problem of the equinox cpu.  
So, the cameras are fucking awesome. But as many report, there is a lag between pressing the shoot button and the actual capture moment  aka shutter lag. What I notice is that of the pictures I take I get a ""movement photo"" (not sure if this is what it's named in English) that basically shows you the 1 second video of all the frames within the 1 sec or so shutter lag. That looks to me as if this is on purpose to find  maybe the best frames to combine for the best picture. 
If this is indeed by design, then maybe this feature can be disabled and we can have instant shutter speeds?"	N

S22 Ultra Whitestone Dome review - do not buy	"I've been using the Whitestone Dome tempered glass on my device for about 1.5 months now, and I thought I would share my experience with the community.
One of the first things I noticed about the tempered glass before applying it was how thin it was. I've used their tempered glass screen protectors on the S8+, S9+, and Note9, and the S22 Ultra one is noticeably thinner. 
The installation process went well. You shouldn't have any issues as long as you follow their instructions. Something worth pointing out is that the alignment of the protector isn't perfect. It becomes extremely obvious after application when you look at the [front-facing camera](https://i.imgur.com/x7hplwk.jpg). I'm also annoyed at how the [camera cut-out goes below the status bar, and also has a slight rainbow effect when you look at it.](https://i.imgur.com/Agwvfow.jpg)
The biggest problem with this screen protector is that it chips/cracks on its own. It happened to me after about a month of use, where the tempered glass inexplicably [chipped](https://i.imgur.com/kcPp3Nd.jpg) on the side. I have yet to drop this phone since owning it, and I always take extra care of my electronics in general. I didn't think much of it until the [same thing](https://i.imgur.com/lIpUf4a.jpg) happened to a friend that also hasn't dropped their phone and takes very good care of their electronics. This prompted me to do a quick search on Amazon for reviews, and I was able to find [8 people](https://imgur.com/a/Eu85wef) with the same issue in a few minutes. Some other people on reddit have also reported the same issue [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS22/comments/t7hixi/whitestone_dome_review_cracked_in_4_days/) and [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/S22Ultra/comments/uj3fc5/whitestone_dome_quality_sucks/). The worst part about this is that the warranty replacement costs more than the product, at least in Canada. You have to pay 23.99 USD (~31 CAD) for one protector even though a new kit (that includes 2 protectors) costs 45-50 CAD on Amazon. Couple that with the fact that you'll probably experience the same chipping issue eventually, it doesn't make much sense to buy the product to begin with, let alone pay for a replacement.
The oleophobic coating on the protector is great. The one on my Note9 is still holding up. No issues with case compatibility either.
Moving on to the fingerprint scanner, it's mostly fine. I have an S21 Ultra without any protector to compare with side-by-side, and I definitely notice a difference. The protector interferes with unlocking when your fingers are dry and wet. Sometimes you'll need to apply extra pressure if your fingers are dry, and even then it might not work. I had a similar experience with the AmFilm on my S21 Ultra, so I don't think it's avoidable.
I could live with all of the issues I brought up in this post except for the chipping problem, so I wouldn't recommend that you buy this product. It should be damn near perfect with how expensive it is."	N
How does the battery hold?	I read everywhere that battery life is awful. But since I have Pixel 2XL with a bit less battery and it lasts a whole day (camera, a lot of social apps), in end I have 10% left. Because S22 has a slightly bigger battery I am thinking, this is not such a bad battery as all are stated, or?	N
How does Samsung's Sleeping/Deep Sleeping setting work?	"Hi all,
1) If I were to put a banking app that I rarely use, but say if I login from my PC and the OTP is sent as notification from the app, how would that would if the app was put in Deep Sleeping? 
2) Is there a risk to put financial/banking/shopping apps that are rarely used to deep sleep? Will I miss any notification of improper sign in from a different device (hacking) for example?
3) How does Sleeping and Deep Sleeping actually even work? Say I use the Amazon app for shopping. I only ever need it when I open the app, I do not need notifications whatsoever. Will it automatically go into Sleeping/Deep Sleeping when I exit the app, or must I specifically close/kill the app for it to go into a Sleeping/Deep Sleeping mode? 
4) Also, is it worth putting lightly used apps into deep sleep? Is there a tangible improvement in battery life? 
Thanks!"	N

Advice/Help S22 Battery Drain from google play services	"Hey guys,
Im unsure what version Samsung S22 i have as i see there are two types of S22's (i'm in NZ if that helps). 
My phone is 4/5 days old - bought it on Monday
Does anyone have advice on how to help lower the drain from google play services, i swapped from an S10 and did the smart switch, but notice after 2 hours of my phone being on (1 phone call about 10mins, some reddit for about 30mins and about 40mins of spotify driving to work) the battery is dropping to about 65%, the battery use thing says that 13% of that is from Google Play Services and is at the top of the list, but i have all of the options off in Settings&gt;Google cause i dont use anything other than bixby routines which is just, turn wifi on when home and moble data off and vice versa - does this make the location ping constantly to cause the drain?
I'm unsure what else to do, i've been googling and people here reckon 5% from google play is too high..? my mate at work who has an S21 for example and his Google Play Services has used 0.6% in the same amount of time - he smart switched his from an S8.
Just wondering if anyone has some advice or help or if someone's solved this for themselves. Am thinking of taking all my photos off and screenshotting which apps i have and just doing a fresh install is the next step, but just wondering if im missing something.
Thanks in advance :)"	N
Is S22 and upgrade or downgrade from S20 FE?	"I'm perfectly happy with my S20 FE but found out I can trade in mine for $800 towards any S22 model, which makes the 128 GB S22 free. I assumed bigger number means better phone but it actually looks to be a downgrade in many regards which is why I have some questions. 
It looks like the objective downgrades are:
* No SD card slot
* Smaller screen
* Smaller battery (not necessarily worse battery life)
* Lower quality front camera
* No MST
And the Upgrades:
* More powerful processor
* 2GB more RAM
* Better rear camera
Am I missing anything important? Camera quality doesn't matter to me. Display quality and processor power are most important to me as I watch videos and play demanding games often.The loss of the SD card slot hurts but the 256 GB model should suffice. Is this phone worth it for $0 or should I stick with what I have?"	N
Probable used Phone direct from Samsung??	" 
Hi,
I  bought a S22 Ultra directly from Samsung for Verizon service. The phone  came today and I noticed that it had a SIM card inside.
I  have read by doing some research that these phones might come with one.  The surprise is that the phone came with an ACTIVE SIM CARD.
Basically,  the sim card is from a lady called Paulette. I was able to even call  with the phone to Verizon to verify that the sim card is from an active  account.
Called Samsung back and  they told me that they do no have refurbished S22 Ultras for sale but  that they would check and contact me back with what happened (Im still  on the phone trying to solve it before they let me go).
Im  going to ask for another phone, as the card issue makes me think that  it is not new. But I wanted to ask more experienced people their opinion  as I change phones once in a blue moon.
Any ideas?
THANKS in advance."	N

Question to S22 Ultra users (specifically Europe members) - Thoughts about switching from Pixel 6 Pro, should I do it?	"Hello people. I will try to be short and exact on my decision and structure my queries in easy to read way regarding my questions and concerns. Here it goes:
1. **Why did you buy P6 Pro?**  
A: Value for money, no bs vanilla Android, timely updates, security, long term support
2. **Why do you want to switch?**  
A: 5G/VolTE/VoWiFi are not supported in my region since Google chose a handful of EU countries where this device will be supported. They will never enable these features for me or bother talking with the Network providers regarding their devices. Also FP reader after all the updates is absolute trash, LDAC is buggy on the highest setting (990kbp/s) with my Sony XM4
My concerns:
1. Do I have to worry that S22 Ultra will be locked from using 5G/VolTE/VoWiFi if I get it from some Europe based store (Amazon etc) and be blocked across EU like the Pixel is (but Samsung users aren't)
2. Do I have to worry for S22 Ultra battery life? Mixed calls constantly. One half says it's good, other: it's bad
3. Since I will get it from EU it will come with Exynos, I don't care about games, but is the Snapdragon worth the hassle and safe to use with EU networks?
4. Is the device stable (OS Updates, bugs etc)?
I tried looking for videos where they compare the devices from performance and usage side of things, but most of the time it's 90% camera this, camera that, camera on this one, camera on that one and very little on the things from an user perspective.
Thank you very much in advance."	N
Pixel 6 vs Galaxy S22+	Hi reddit. I just bought a Pixel 6 for $599 to replace my ancient 2xl, and so far I'm happy with it except for the wonky fingerprint scanner. I'm still well within the return window, and the Galaxy S22+ just went on sale for $699 (via my Google Fi membership). Should I swap the Pixel 6 for the Galaxy S22+? I know the S22+ has a better fingerprint scanner, but since I'm going to use a tempered glass screen protector (as I am on the Pixel), I wonder if that would make a difference. Also wondering about other pros/cons. Does anyone know if typing is easier on one phone or the other? Thank you for your wisdom, internet denizens.	N
Should I cancel my S22 order?	"I'm kinda pissed off. A week ago I decided to order a green S22 on Amazon's Samsung page and they said that I would receive it in 2 days. So, 2 days later, I saw that my order got cancelled during the shipping process and I was going to be refunded in the next days. No specific reason were given so kinda weird. I was already a bit pissed and though it was an Amazon issue so I decided to order directly on Samsung website. I decided to go with the blue S22 instead.
They instantly charged me full price as soon as I placed my order... now it has been 4 days and the order is still ""processing"". I did a little bit of research and the blue S22 is apparently a ""custom color"", which means it takes even more time before I will get it and there is apparently shortage currently... And my order is not even past the ""processing"" step. I wouldn't say anything if I didn't get charged full right away, but now I really don't feel like waiting 4+ weeks for something expensive that I ALREADY paid full price... What should I do ?"	N

I have continuously read the pros/ cons of the S22s	I have continuously read the pros/ cons of the S22s because I really like this device. I was just a click away from purchasing said device today but decided to wait a bit longer.

Samsung if your listening or reading this post please add this series to the list to recieve future Android updates (13) instead of the basic security updates after 4 years. Current device puts my iPhone 13 Pro Max to shame.	N
S22 ULTRA	I love having the ability to customize my phone. On the S22 ultra we are no longer able to customize the text app. Only light or dark. Can't change the font or the background.

Refund or Credit Not Offered	I bought an unlocked Galaxy S22 Ultra 256 from Samsung Shop on 4/15/22. Yesterday, I went online checking the availability of a color and pretended to place an order. The pricing is $154.00 less than what I paid. I contacted Samsung Care Pro and I am told no credit can be issued for the difference but it has not been 30 days. Orders can be returned within 30 days for a refund. I would just re-order at the lower price. I spoke with 3 different Care Pro specialists and each were dishonest telling me that I missed the deadline to return for refund is 15 days. I verified the return & refund policy is 30 days. Each of these Care Pro Specialists disconnect the call when I read the policy verbatim. I am very disappointed and shocked that I would receive this level of service which I paying a monthly fee for. Do Samsung realized that customers are not being told the truth.	N
Remap Buttons App?	"I know there are some apps in Play that remap the Bixby/power button, but I think they're all left over from when that was an issue not solvable in the phone settings. They seem to do what we can already do now without an app.

Are You Using 4K 120hz and had problems with plastic screen protectors?	"I'm trying to pinpoint the cause of the issues I've been having with my screen protectors. My running theory is that most screen protectors on Amazon are TPU, which can be effected by heat. I've noticed that my screen runs a bit hotter than it was at WQHD+ 120hz, and believe that the increase in temperature is causing the screen protector to shift ever so slightly.
Yesterday I put on an OEM Samsung screen protector, which is a PET screen protector. I'm still running WQHD+ 120hz hoping it fixes the issue.

It‚Äôs available for pickup today at BestBuy and possible the lowest I‚Äôve seen it for. Has it dropped any lower than that in price? Will I regret it from the 12GB/256GB which is $100 more (out of stock, no restock date). I have BestBuy gift cards so it has to be from there."	N

Anybody else having issues with Screen Protectors?	"I'm on my 3rd TPU screen protector and somehow they're all shifting. First one shifted to the left, second one to the right. I thought I had misaligned them at first, but on my 3rd one it shifted so far that a portion came off the screen.
I'm thinking it might be the material do the screen protector (TPU vs PET), but I've had TPU on all of my phones since the S10+ and didn't have an issue with those."	N

Oleophobic coating, how is it holding up on S22	Hi all, I noticed the oleophobic coating on the s22 (using it for a week) is not as strong as on the s10e I bought almost 3 years ago. I do mistakes on my keyboard presses too much oil on the screen. It just isn't as fingerprint dry as my old s10e. I'm not saying there isn't any oleophobic coating but it just accumulates oil residue easier than apple phones and old samsung phones. Interestingly, iphones use samsung displays. Maybe apple has a secret formula samsung phones cannot use. How is your oleophobic coating holding up? I also baught an s9 and returned it for an s10e in 2019. The s9 did not have any oleophobic coating issues either. Its probably poor quality control during pandemic.	N
Cannot install CA certificates?	"I have AdGuard on my S22, and recently it said HTTPS filtering was disabled. I went through the process of reinstalling it, but now my phone doesn‚Äôt see the certificate that I downloaded. I‚Äôve tried saving it to the downloads folder, the root of the storage folder, OneDrive, Google Drive, nothing. 
The first time this happened I had to factory reset a few times until the phone could see the files. I‚Äôm trying to avoid doing that again. 
Anyone experience something similar?"	N
S22 battery time	"So I just got the base s22 model (Snapdragon) and I still don't know if the battery screen on time will get better by time.
Last night I got 2h9m SoT and 19h47m with screen off time (from 100 to 15%).
Any thoughts about this ?"	N
Colors changing on Google Calendar - S22 base	"Have had my S22 a little over a week now and something weird is going on with Google Calendar.  I noticed that the colors of certain events were not as vibrant as they were on my old Pixel 3.  
I uninstalled Calendar on the S22 and reinstalled it and behold, the colors match the P3 closer.
Then, after a few days, the colors go back to being less vibrant.  I also note that on the P3, the default event colors (blue and green) have white text, while on the S22 it's black text.  After the re-install of GCal the text is back to white like the P3, until it changes on its own at some point.
Both are set to Light theme, is there some other display setting that could be causing this?
Pics:
https://imgur.com/a/7N2Aq62
Edit: I just updated the Pixel 3 to Android 12 and now the calendar shows the same muted colors, so it appears it's related to Android 12, not to the phone model.  Annoying.  I don't understand why the colors look ""good"" on the S22 when I first install Gcal and then revert to the more muted look after a couple days, though."	N
Case for S22 - DBrand, Speck, Incipio?	"My previous phones were OnePlus and S10+, tried many cases and was looking for something with good grip and protection but also something that doesn't make the phone too bulky and slippery.

Genshin impact issues on galaxy s22 models	"I'm currently experiencing issues with my s22 where some game apps will freeze or crash. Main concern is genshin where certain character models aren't loading and the 2nd phase of inazuma bosses slows to 1 frame per second while audio is fine. The slow down makes it almost impossible to leave the app forcing me either keep prrssing the screen until i can leave or to force restart the phone. I do not experience it on my old s9 and an s20+. So my question is are any of you with the galaxy s22 models of phones having issues playing games like genshin?

Looking for a compact battery pack to throw in a briefcase to top up when needed. But the best output I can find on a battery pack that size is 20w, which won't power super fast charging. So I am wondering how much worse the charging speed is on fast charging instead of super fast charging."	N
Dual eSIM as DSDS?	"This may be a stretch, but I'd love to ditch physical SIMs entirely. I know for sure you can have dual-SIM dual-standby with one physical and one eSIM, but does the S22 line support dual eSIM with dual standby, with no physical SIM? Apparently the newer iPhones can, so I'm hoping. It would be great to have both lines available.

S22 Ultra Red order delayed a lot‚Ä¶.	"Anybody else having to wait a long time for their S 22 Ultra order?? I think it might be because of the color I chose.
Probably ignorable ramble:
Super confused as to what‚Äôs going on. My S 21 ultra fell in such a way to the screen broke. Getting it fixed it was going to cost around $300, but just buying an S 22 ultra was going to cost a little over 400 with the trade-in so I put my Sim card in my wife‚Äôs old iPhone expecting it to get here by May 10. 
I got notifications about it being delayed, and then I got a notification saying that it would be here by the 23rd, and now I‚Äôm getting another notification saying that it‚Äôs delayed again. Is this just because of the color I chose? But this point I‚Äôm tempted to just cancel the order and get a next generation pixel seven when it comes out in November or whatever and just tough it out on the iPhone."	N
Suggestions Required: Tempered Glass Screen Protector in India	"Basically the title. 
For S22+, Besides Spigen, the options for Tempered glass screen protectors are limited in India and based on the reviews i've seen, Fingerprint scanner does not work with Glas.tR and Spigen NeoFlex is not Tempered glass

Speaker Crackling and Distortion Issue	"I have seen multiple people reporting this issue in this subreddit but wanted to provide my experience:
Bought an S22+ on April 30 from an offline store (India) and the phone worked fine (Antutu never crossed 74k even after constant tweaks but I guess that's a separate rant)
On May 14th I realised that my speakers were not working and audio was playing a crackling sound instead. Called the dealer and he asked me to visit a Samsung care centre near me and ask for the device to be considered as Dead on Arrival
On reaching the care centre I was told that they would not be able to consider the device as DOA since 14 days have been completed (It was the 15th day)
What makes it worse is that he knew how to resolve the issue (remove SIM card slot where playing something on speakers- Available as a quickfix on samsung forum) and blamed me for 'inserting SIM card forcefully' and said this is expected behaviour and not a design flaw. No complaint was registered by them
A day later (today) I started facing the same issue and although SIM slot reinsertion did the trick, I am amazed at how Samsung expects us to ignore their design flaw. This is a premium device that I paid for and yet the customer support is abysmal. If this is what i'm facing on day 15, i'm worried wether it would survive my 5 year phone utilozation cycle.
Any help on how to get Samsung to recall devices facing this issue or get my device replaced would be highly appreciated!
TL;DR: S22+ Speaker crackling issue not being treated as a flaw by Samsung"	N

My S22 Ultra magsafe / Qi charging car mount solution, without breaking the bank...	"TL;DR: found an affordable, simple black case [here](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B09W4LX25F/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) and a solid car mount [here](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B08NT9NPDD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) and they're working very nicely for me.
So this phone is just too damn big to stick in a cupholder or anywhere else ""safe-ish"" to use google maps, etc, while driving in my car. Heck, my car has Qi charging in the little console, but the phone's (just barely) too big to sit on the pad!
So I started looking into car mounts, and came across a bunch of magsafe stuff. Obviously magsafe is an apple thing, but there are cases and also rings you can buy out there that'll do the trick.
First, I ran across Mous, which it turns out is a **proprietary system that is not magsafe compatible**. Their stuff looks really cool, but it's pretty expensive, and ONLY works with other Mous stuff. I can't support that kinda thing just on principle, especially when Samsung offers such good trade-in deals every year that I've been upgrading often. I'm not spending $60 extra each year on a new case, and who knows what else.
So then I saw stuff from Pitaka, and it looks really nice, but again, $60 for a case feels like a lot when my non-magsafe spigen was like $10.
Off to Amazon and other random searches, and all I could find was a clear case where the magsafe ring is visible, and it's just not a look I dig. Clear cases end up just showing off all the dirt/oil/scuffs etc they pick up, so no thanks to that.
I decided to put off my search since all the stuff just seemed so expensive, but once a week for a while I just kept seeing if anything new popped up on Amazon, and finally something did! I'd never heard of ""HikerClub"", but I was willing to risk $22 since Amazon has a pretty reliable return policy if I didn't like the case.
The S22 Ultra is heavy, so I didn't want to get a car vent mount because I just didn't know if it was a good idea to hang both a mount and a big-ass phone from the vent. I landed on [the ESR Halolock](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B08NT9NPDD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) magsafe car mount, as it seemed a little more compact and solid than other mounts I looked at.
I've seen a few threads in this sub asking about / sharing info on magsafe options for the S22 Ultra, but all of the solutions were more expensive than I really wanted to go, and/or had other quirks about them that I just didn't care for, so I thought I'd share what I found!"	N

S22+ First week Battery results (S22 Plus)	"Many people want to know what battery is like on the S22 phones, so I thought I'd document my experience on my Samsung Galaxy S22+ for the first week. 
**TLDR**: Average duration= 14h 9m; SOT= 4h12m [Imgur Album of first week](https://imgur.com/a/yQNG4lb)
My phone stated that it was ""analyzing"" my battery usage the first 2 days. I'm not entirely sure what all goes into that with Samsung (this is my first Samsung phone since the S1), but Android in general takes a couple of days before the phone optimizes based on your usage. I plugged my phone in overnight each night. Sun + Sat I unplugged around 730ish AM, Mon-Fri I unplugged around 6ish AM. Each day when I got down to around 20%, I took a screenshot that captured my total duration for the day, my SOT (Screen On Time), and my top 10 draining apps. Top offenders were YouTube, Maps, a mobile game (Legends of Runeterra), and Google Play Services. You can see each day's screenshot along with the week overview screenshot at the Imgur link above. 
I think I managed to avoid plugging my phone in before 20% each day, so besides the fact that it wasn't exactly 20% each day, the results should be fairly accurate. I did not limit my activity, even if I was near 20%. This included navigation, watching YouTube, using Bluetooth earphones, and playing a game (Legends of Runeterra).
If you take out the first 2 days to factor is Android's battery optimization, then Average duration is 14h 33m, and SOT is 4h 11m.
I'm now curious enough that I may document the whole first month, but I don't think I'll take a screenshot each day and instead keep track in a spreadsheet. Feel free to ask any questions, the data is still available in my settings me until tomorrow, at which point I'll have to rely on screenshots. I hope this is helpful!
Edit: I should note that I did have on Adaptive Power Saving, for whatever that might be worth."	N

Charger	Hello everyone. I have a question concerning chargers. I currently have a S10 and am planning on upgrading to the S22+ sometime this year . I currently have my S10 set to normal wired charging ( not fast wired charging) and fast wireless charging. I prefer to charge my phone overnight plugged into the charger, but it is not set to fast charge. I think this is probably easier on the battery. In case I need to top off my battery during the day during heavy usage, I can easily use my fast wireless charger. If I fast wirelessly charge, the phone becomes noticeably warmer, whereas an overnight wired charge never results in a warm phone. I have the original charger which came with my S10 and was wondering if this would work on my S22+. I know the S22+ has the capability of 25 and 45 watt charging, but I was hoping to use the same original charger that I am using now with my S10. Does anyone have experience from moving from a S10 to an S22+ and charger recommendations? Thanks very much in advance for your help.	N
Can you create virtual credit card on Google Pay?	"I heard that Apple Pay have the option to create virtual temporary credit cards that allow you to pay for items from companies that you do not trust. How this basically works is that you create a virtual credit card number. It is associated with your real credit card but the vendor do not see your credit card. Instead, you give the virtual card number. Once the transaction is complete, you can delete or remove the virtual card. The vendor now has a uslesess card if they try to scam you.
Now, I heard that we were able to do it on Google Wallet app. But now Google has taken that away from us, is there a way to do that on Google Pay?
I want the buy a South Asian candy from a vendor from Asia that I do not trust giving out my real credit card number to... I want to create a temporary virtual card and give that out so I can cancel it without a hassle once the transaction has been processed."	N
S22+ from Pixel 6 Pro	So I have the Pixel 6 Pro and the S22+. Man I love the software on the Pixel, but boy do I love the design and hardware of the S22+. I'm leaning towards keeping the S22+, but man I will miss the stock feel and features of the Pixel. What I find interesting is, the S22+ is only 1080P where as the Pixel is 1440P. Yet I think the display on the S22+ looks better. God I wish Samsung made a Google edition of the S22+ like they did a few years ago for one of the phones they made. I know the modem on the Pixel sucks from seeing articles and posts on the web, and that the one in the S22+ is supposed to be pretty much the best on the market now and it's brand new. The S22+ is $699 and the Pixel is $899	N

Battery life questions (UK)	"I'm considering buying an S22, but I'm not sure whether or not the battery life will last me a day. All of the reviews that I've seen online are conflicting with some saying that the battery life is manageable and others saying it's downright horrible, so I would like to get some more opinions.
I mostly use my phone for WhatsApp, music, YouTube and some low performance gaming (eg Clash Royale and Clash of Clans).  On weekdays, I spend about 3 hours maximum a weekday on my phone but on weekends, that can be anywhere from 2-5 hours, so I would like to know if the S22 will be able to last me a solid 5 hours (with a sim card in it and WiFi and Bluetooth and Dark Mode always on)."	N
2-month Review	"Here's a short 2-month review of my base model S22. As a background I moved to my new phone from an LG G8X so I'll be comparing to it.
Great phone. Love to have a premium feeling phone in a smaller yet comfortable way. My last phone felt too tall and top heavy. Screen is so much better. I feel LG has more natural colors, but the higher PPI and 120hz in the S22 makes it much crisper and smoother. My old phone was still running Android 10 so moving to Android 12 was a little bit of a learning curve but it's so much better. I've had 3 updates since I've had the phone, when my LG had 3 updates in 2021 alone. One UI is a whole other league compared to LG's software, way less buggy and smooth. In performance, I havent had the opportunity to push the 8 Gen 1 in heavy games, but I can tell you that it's faster and more efficient than the 855. In my LG, WhatsApp video call would drain my battery and heat up the phone to the point it actually made your hand feel like it's burning. On the S22 battery life is much better in WhatsApp and doesnt heat up so much. Now on battery life, when I got my LG new, I could get 2 days out of it easy, but after 2 years of heavy use, I could barely squeeze out 8h of SOT. On the S22, battery life wasn't so great out the gate, but IT GETS BETTER OVER TIME. After 2 months I can get 6h of SOT with battery protection on(charges to 85%) and alternating between low brightness  and high brightness depending on environment. This is comparing the 4000mah in the LG and the 3700mah in the S22.
In conclusion, no regrets. Love it so far. Love the guaranteed 4 OS updates by Samsung which made me choose it over the Pixel. Lowkey miss the headphone jack. RIP LG. Thanks."	N
I received my S22+ yesterday	"So I ordered an S22+ in green (it could be a slightly lighter shade, this looks almost black) for Google Fi and for a little while I hated it but after getting it set up as I like it Im now pretty impressed with it. I came over from the Google phone ecosystem, started back with a Nexus 5 and my last one was a Pixel 4XL, I bought a Pixel 6 and returned it because it drained battery so badly overnight (25%+).
I ended up using the launcher I prefer, Nova, and I put the Google Phone, messages, and calendar apps on because I am just used to them. The battery overnight seems good but using the phone it sure drains quick so far.

Now that I made the switch to Samsung I deeply regret it.. Where I could play mobile games with constant 60fps on QHD before without even throttling at all on my oppo..
I now am playing games which stutter and even sometimes crash in startup.. After playing a lil bit of wild rift (5minutes) it will start to throttle and 60fps turns into  40... I have tried disabling GOS off and on.. But it's not getting any better.
Just want warn everybody who is about to obtain a phone with exynos, if you want to play games don't get this phone.
S22 ultra is amazing for literally anything else except for gaming...
Also using USB tethering is considerably worse than on my old phone.. It always disconnects even with power saving off

2 S22s coming my way - need 4 wireless chargers without breaking the bank	"I've been using Poco phones for the last 4 years, so I've never had the chance to use wireless charging. But now when Xiaomi took a bad turn and Samsung made their devices a bit more affordable, this will change.
Long story short, I need 4 chargers for the 2 phones - 2 for work and 2 at the house.
Thing is - they're expansive, surprise surprise.
I looked at Aliexpress and saw many sellers with sealed Samsung chargers, but after checking them out at Samsung's site - they're quite old. Like 2016/2018 old.
Some say they're rated for 9w, while most of them are good for 10w. 
Question - how much worse will a 10w ""satellite dish"" charger from 2018 perform against Samsung's latest ""square"" model that's rated for 15w?
For the price of one 2022 charger I can buy 4 new-old stocks.
If it's going to be noticeably bad - are 3rd party chargers worth it? Like Belkin or Anker -  no no-names since I don't want my house to burn down, or should I go all in and get the 4 small ones that Samsung sells for 70-80 bucks a piece?..
I guess I could look at FB marketplace as well, but I'm not sure if I got the patience to hunt for this many items."	N

Bought the 128GB 8GB Ram S22U... Mistake?	I'm loving this phone. Nothing wrong with it it's incredibly smooth and fast.

S22 Ultra	When you charge $1200 to $1500 for a phone, it does not come with a charger or complimentary audio adapter, EVERYTHING ABOUT THE PHONE should be on point. I can not even use Android Auto, because the Audio, output and quality, takes a huge nose dive when plugged in. I have to keep the Android Auto turned off and use Bluetooth only for any Audio. The Bluetooth of course drops off or disconnects periodically because Google features are being used on the new Samsungs, due to the Samsung Google partnership. If Samsung continues this partnership with Google, be prepared for a lot more problems in phone functionality, as well as major added expense for extra accessories just to use features on your phone. Samsung did much more than drop the ball, they ran it to the other teams goal themselves.	N
S22 Ultra Pre-order Credits	So I pre-ordered the s22 ultra back when you could and 3 months later still haven't gotten an email or anything about the pre-order credits... is there anything I can do now or are they gone?	N
SAMSUNG GOOGLE PARTNERS	Samsung is forming a partnership with Google. This is why a lot of the features are similar to Google phones. (Ex. Finger Print on front of phone.)This is also why the new Samsungs have so many problematic issues. (Ex. Poor Audio, Bluetooth issues, Android Auto Problems etc.) Google phones are terrible. I have used Samsung for a long time, but was talked into trying a Google phone earlier this year. It was so bad I paid it off within the first two weeks to trade it back in on the new Samsung. Google does not focus on functionality or other features like audio in a phone. Unfortunately, because of this partnership, I purchased the S22 Ultra only to have a lot of the same problems I tried to get away from.	N
S22 Ultra warranty question.	I broke my S22 Ultra's screen so I had it repaired at my local ubreakifix location and I am confused about my warranty.

$50 back	Since I received the S22Ultra I am trying to contact to claim $50 with the code they gave me when I bought it.It is not the $50, it is the disorganized way, lack of logistics to serve people, I also have to say that it is the first time that I have problems, but not being able to solve it for so many months like others is something totally unacceptable.Samsung, as you have improved in many areas, customer service is very very important.Many people prefer a better service than an article.

Dolphin new report explains what problems and workarounds need the exynos 2200 rdna2 gpu to use their full potential.	"Resume: Use vulkan mode allways that you could it.
This may not sound very interesting, but this was a quick fix necessary to fix Dolphin running under an OpenGLES wrapper called ANGLE. Why exactly?
The story actually started a few months ago, when it was announced that the Exynos 2200 chipset to be used in some models of the Samsung Galaxy S22 would contain AMD's RDNA2 graphics hardware and drivers. This left us very interested. RDNA2 is great hardware, and while AMD's drivers may not be¬†best in class, they are leagues above the horrors we've seen on Android. We were very hopeful!
Now the hardware is out and users have been able to test it. Vulkan performance on the Exynos 2200 is a step above what we've seen on any other phone. It's able to reach full speed in demanding games like¬†Super Mario Galaxy¬†at up to 2x Internal Resolution¬†without¬†having to disable critical features like EFB Access to CPU. This is notable because GPU readbacks have long been a major bottleneck on mobile devices.
But when we saw OpenGLES on the device, we were taken aback. It's disappointing to say the least. More disappointing than normal AMD OpenGL drivers on Windows. Even more disappointing than¬†Mali¬†drivers. That's because there are¬†no OpenGLES drivers provided for this device. Instead, it uses a wrapper called¬†ANGLE¬†to¬†translate¬†OpenGLES to Vulkan.
ANGLE was designed to translate¬†WebGL¬†to other graphics APIs.¬†It was not designed for and was never tested in real games.¬†Naturally, there were some¬†growing pains.

Skype is not ringing when phone is locked or generally when Skype is not the active app	"I have this issue where Skype is not ringing when phone is locked  or generally when Skype is not the active app - just the notification sound is heard once (and I get some vibrations if those are enabled).
If Skype is the active app it rings just fine.
The Teams app (also from Microsoft) is working perfectly, so this is a little strange.
Has anybody seen anything similar? Any solution?
EDIT:
Skype is not in sleep or deep sleep and in fact is ""unoptimized"" so it instantly gets the call to it even if the phone is locked (proven by the notification sound and eventually vibrations), the issue is generating the sound for ringing (when Skype is not active, which I believe is a new restriction since the more recent Android versions)."

Discussion/Tip: "Night" mode takes superior photos during the daytime	"Hi. I hand shot some photos with my camera steadied on a flat surface and took a series of photos in diffuse (not direct), natural indoor light from the sun. Using Night mode vs the standard Photo mode, I consistently found that Night mode takes superior photos, even in the daytime. The ISO is significantly lower (16 vs 100), the image has truer colors, and the image is significantly less pixelated. 
The shutter speed was 2.5x slower on Night mode as well, so I'm not sure how well it would do handheld. But in some quick tests, it still appears to be superior for stationary objects.
This was when using the main 1x camera. I haven't tested other cameras.

Any fix for wifi turning off when phone is off?

I have checked permissions for the Messages app and it is not going to sleep (again since I can stay connected if i switch to data), I have reset my network connections which sucks because I lost all my wifi and bluetooth auto logins, and I have turned off wifi ""save battery.""

Horrible customer service.	I'm usually not the type to take my time writing a review but this is to warn you all about Samsungs horrible customer service. In Feb 2022 I pre ordered my s22 which included a trade in refund. Two months went by and the price of my order dropped $200 (on the trade in, I called samsung customer service to have the price adjusted and they assured me that once I receive my order my order would be price adjusted and the difference would be refunded. I called back once I received my phone in April and then they said I would receive the difference once they receive my trade in. By April the S22 ultra was already sold in stores and wouldn't be even considered a pre order. I then sent the old phone in and then had to call them back and then they refused to honor the refund stating that price adjustments cannot be made on the trade in. Clearly I had all documentation of the conversations I had including multiple chat conversations where the representatives had documented that the initial $500 refund would be adjusted to $700 once I send in my old phone. I called samsung 4 times, hours of waiting, including 3 times the call mysteriously drops and then I spoke to the supervisor who tried to twist their words around stating that the previous representative had initially offered a price match on the phone itself which didn't make any sense because I had her confirm that the previous rep had actually documented this in my account that I would indeed get the price match for my trade in. I believe this is false advertising, and for samsung being such a big company and doing this to their loyal customers make me want to stop using Samsung all together. This post is just to warn you all about how Samsung treats their customers, be aware and have all your chats and follow up emails ready for their shady way of doing business. Perhaps it's time to switch to Apple who I know sure has great customer service, bye bye Samsung, thank you for wasting my time, frustration and empty promises.	N

Even opening up the Alexa app doesn't work, the volume adjustment doesn't work there either.Was never an issue with previous phones with the same app and the same Echo devices.Is this a related issue to the Android 12 problem that doesn't allow control of the volume on a Chromecast, or a different bug altogether?	N
Specify notification sound by app	I've always had the ability to choose which sound is triggered by each app. Now, EVERYTHING is forced to use the same notification sound and I can't find a way to change it per app in my S22 Ultra. This was key for me to know what required my attention and what could wait. Does anyone know how to do it on the S22 phones? The option is gone under the notifications menu now. (I really hate when I pay for an upgrade and lose features!)Taz	N

Do your Ultra camera lenses get dirty often?	"Considering the Ultra's large area containing the cameras and laser, how often do your lenses or your camera/lens protector(s) get dirty requiring you to wipe them off? What do you tend to use to do so? 
I know various factors would influence this... like if you work in a hand lotion factory or you're a forest ranger... Just wanted to get an idea... 
This is going to be really funny if it's just me."	N
Can you use a USB-C flash drive for storage on a S22 Ultra	I have a USB-C flash drive. I was under the impression you could use it for storage like a micro sd card. Put it in and it ask me if I want Insta 360 (program for my action cam) to open it, but I don't see anywhere where its an actual storage device?	N

Battery drains too fast - S22 Ultra 5G Exynos	"Samsung is marketing that the 5000mah battery of the S22U Exynos will last one day. Untrue on Android 12
Screen On Time often between the 4 or 5 hours
Functions enabled:
Adaptive Display, 120Hz, WQHD+, Find My Mobile(location always enabled), Always On Display(Always)
I refuse to use Battery Power Saving mode as it blocks incoming important notifications such as emails 
Other issues:
- Messenger often doesn't see the active wifi or data connection which is enabled on the phone. Also sending messages are often delayed (Battery Power Saving not enabled)
- Facebook says I'm offline even though I'm network connected
- Whatsapp backup slow
- Samsung Keyboard hangs/lagging during typing, after X amount of seconds it typed everything I tapped before 
Phone has been reset 2 days ago to its factory settings, currently May update

this is my 4th time contacting support, and if i dont get a replacement for my defective device immediately i am going to bring the horrible customer support experience to social media. i have had numerous problems with my device and i dont have time to send it in for 2 weeks to get fixed. i have a samsung store near me and and can bring my broken device and original accessories for a replacement. i have also already been told to go to a samsung store for a walk in to repair it and when i got there after driving for half an hour they said i couldnt just walk in and had to come back another day for an appointment eventhough i was told by customer support to just walk in.
do people at samsung talk to each other? its ridiculous.

Clear case recommendations?	"I finally ordered myself a green s22 (base) and am really stoked! Upgrading from an s9 so I'm sure I won't be disappointed:)
Now comes the hard part - the case. I have always had black phones but now I am ready to have some fun with it. I have read varying levels of satisfaction with different clear cases due to yellowing or being too bulky/slippery, and am curious what everyone here might suggest. Currently my top choices:
Ringke Fusion-X Compatible with Samsung Galaxy S22 5G Case (2022) Transparent Hard Back Heavy Duty Rugged Shockproof TPU Bumper Cover - Black https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B09PWM7QZX/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_i_BZMS9PZ4BG936WZTG4PT?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1
I love the style here, and the textured sides seem great. I am not sure sure about the aggressive look and bulky corners though. 
Ringke Fusion Compatible with Samsung Galaxy S22 5G Case (2022) Anti-Fingerprint Frost Hard Back Shockproof Bumper Cover - Matte Clear https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B09PMCLR4Z/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_i_X6DZJ2DC244YM2Z072K2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1
Love how the frosted back should resist fingerprints and the fully clear style would show the chrome frame. Not sure if the buttons would have good tactile feedback and they don't seem textured so I wonder how grippy it is. 
ESR Metal Kickstand Case Compatible with Samsung Galaxy S22 Case (2022), Versatile Patented Kickstand, Crystal Clear Scratch-Resistant Back Cover, Clear https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B09LCPHKZT/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_i_EHQDE7GHHZ8BQ4VZNHSF?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1
I watch YouTube on lunch breaks all the time and the kickstand feature looks great. Seems well built. Otherwise I'm not sure about grip and bulk as well as if the stand would catch pockets/collect a bunch of lint. 
Other than these the Samsung clear kickstand and green leather cases look very slick, if pricey. 
Anyone here try out these cases and care to comment? At the end of the day, what feels best in the hand and keeps your phone enjoyable to use?
Thank you!"	N

S22 Battery Options	"Hi all! I am looking to potentially upgrade my Galaxy S7 to potentially a Galaxy S22. My Galaxy S7 still works great, but it‚Äôs begun to lag pretty badly, so I‚Äôm looking to upgrade before it begins to have true problems. 
A local retailer is having a great sale on the base model for the S22. After reading some reviews, I understand that the battery life is subpar, but the rest of the phone is great. For the S22, are there ways to update the settings to improve battery life (like the medium power saving mode on the S7)? Or are there settings that can be turned off to help the battery? Also, what is your experience with the base S22, do you like using it? Are there other models I should look at instead?
Any advice is great. Thanks in advance!"	N
S21 vs. S22/S22+ Battery	"How does the S21 battery stack up to the newer S22 or S22+?

Samsung & LSO a romance in Tragedy	So on April 23 I ordered a s22 set to arrive May 9, its May 17 and my device has yet to be delivered. I contacted both LSO and Samsung, LSO did not respond, Samsung on the other hand responded, 19 customer reps and 4 supervisors later came to the conclusion that's its still the customers responsibility to pay for a new order if the first one is lost in transition, that they understand that they know how it feels but all they can do is refund ur money within 10 business days or create a new order, mmmm sounds like a role of the dice to me. You would think that Samsung would be able to rectify a problem like this with ease, but that's not the case. With this being said supervisors Kevin & Sharooq poor people skills poor management. I have been a loyal Samsung customer since 2014, this experience has changed everything. For Samsung buyers out there especially in Texas don't order go to a retail store save urself the headache of dealing with Samsungs reps and LSO absent customer reps. Or just try a new brand. And as for Samsung and it's 1-800-726-7864, Samsung products are expensive for customers to be treated like this. Au revoir Vijaya	N

S22 Ultra slow Samsung DeX on PC	So I've been using DeX mode on monitor because it feels very fluid and productive, the same as using a computer. Yet when I connect it to DeX for PC it lags pretty horribly, moving windows around and typing text. I use a USB C cable for both monitor and PC mode.I also tried wireless but it was the same or slightly worse on PC. I read in the FAQ that I should try 5GHz bandwidth. I'm not sure how to set it up, but another FAQ makes an excuse that it uses something something -264 compression technology to connect to the PC.Not sure if it is worth trying to figure out how to switch to 5GHz. Has anyone done this? Does it lag the same? Is there another way, or do I just stick with monitors alone? I really wanted the convenient phone/PC connection while working.	N
S22 Ultra network lock question	I recently purchased the s22 ultra from directly from Samsung while they had a promotion going on, since it was to good of a deal to pass up on I opted for the t-mobile version of the Phone because I had the note 20 ultra with no RCS support and I really missed Google RCS in the texting app. Now my question is, why is my s22 is network locked?

Samsung Gallery Yellow Icon in S22 Ultra	I just noticed something when I was browsing the photos I took last weekend in my Gallery.

When you tap on the icon, the phone will display a pop-up like it's working on something and then a few seconds later a short 12-second video appears complete with sound. You can chose to save the video if you want. The colors in the image will change and shift, and the brightness dims and cycles along with the music. It's really very beautiful. But WHAT is this called? Why do some images display the icon and others don't? I just noticed this, like it's something that came in the latest update...	N

S22 Ultra Tips and Tricks	"Im going to write this as a basic guide to combat some issues people are posting, and as a 9 year android veteran i just about know android in and out at this point, and have tested and purchased over 50 devices the last 9 years, along with many iphones, technology/smartphones and cars are pretty much my passion.
This guide will help with battery life, performance and thermals. 
Be prepared as this will be lengthy but very useful. This is just a guide/outline, you do not have to follow everything verbatim, but can read through and pick and choose what you find useful or beneficial.
‚Ä¢Must have applications: Thermal Guardian, Battery Guardian, and AccuBattery.
Thermal Guardian: Allows device to throttle earlier or later than stock set thermal threshold. Giving the ability to make your device run cooler or hotter before throttling occurs.
(Left my S22 Ultras display on in my pocket full brightness with 4G hotspot on in 32 celsiusweather (90 fahrenheit) , phone felt very warm but battery temp was only 101 fahrenheit or 38.3 Celsius) which is very impressive. 
Battery Guardian: Detects frequent app wakeups, crashes, apps draining battery or in the background, or apps using high data usage in background etc.
AccuBattery: shows battery drain per hour, minute, idle drain per min/hour and per MA hr drain along with average usage drain and idle.
Super useful.
This app (Battery Guardian) found out TikTok, while being forced closed reopened itself and had high mobile data usage despite not in use, which is very suspicious. It also detected Soundcloud got stuck in the background once, and Google maps has a bug causing occasional random wakeups. Which adds up as i noticed my phone running warm one day randomly under light usage, and to my suprise TikTok drained 6% battery while not being used.
Have heard from others with issues from TikTok despite app not in use.
Performance: not much you can really do besides having some storage space left, although theres a few things that can fix Performance issues. Occasionally using the RAM cleaner can rid of a app not supposed to be in the background. 
Clearing cache partition, and repairing apps, then charging your device for 2 hours while the device is idle and not used. This will force basic Dalvik code to reoptimize, and android ART Runtime optimization will occur which will clear and reoptimize the files needed to run the partition, ridding of any bugs or broken files that may have occurred thru a previous update or background app getting stuck or causing an issue. 
(Most of the time repair apps isnt necessary  just a simple charging for 2 hours while device is idle will kick in android ART runtime and fix all issues)
Battery life: I get 7-8+ hours screen on time most days with casual usage reddit, facebook, chrome etc and 6+ with heavy usage such as bluetooth and soundcloud playing in my car while location services and google maps is navigating on pretty much full brightness, but i do have a lot of features turned off as i dont use that many. My usage is pretty basic with light usage the whole day with an hour or two of heavy usage commuting to work and back.
Features you CAN turn off to save battery life if you choose to: Wifi and all the wifi preference settings
Wifi calling
Bluetooth
Nfc
Nearby Device scanning
Printing
Vpn
Private DNS
Floating notifications
Dark mode
FHD+
Edge panels

Find my device google (Samsung versions better)
Location services
Location Accuracy
Google location History
Location sharing

Bluetooth scanning
Link to windows
Continue on other devices
Samsung Dex
S Pen features you dont use
Motion and gestures
Bixby Routines
Google Assistant
Deny Digital wellbeing access
Live Transcribe
Live captions
These are all features you have the ability to turn off if you choose to or do not use them that have atleast a slight impact on battery life. I have about half of them on, and half of them off, or turn certain ones on as needed.
Here are my battery stats: https://photos.app.goo.gl/te75BYEUe7uHufwE6
The phone took about 2-3 weeks to learn usage patterns. This is different than ""googles Adaptive Battery"". Samsung has there own agressive deep sleep system that will deep sleep unused apps every few days. It finally stopped deep sleeping apps every few days on its own 2 days ago. You can see apps at what day and time there deep sleeped in device care-battery-background usage limits. The phone has deep sleeped 29 applications."	N

heating issue causes battery drain	Firstly, downvote if you like. But realise that there are people on this subreddit having issues with their phone and are generously asking for help.

Is anyone else regretting buying S22 Ultra?	"I got it in February. And I was disappointed immediately.  It was stuttery, there was visible ghosting on the screen, and the battery life was utter crap even after a few weeks. I had to turn off 5G and use FHD+ resolution to get decent battery life. Yeah, and this is for $1.2k+ ü§Ø. I traded in my S9 plus, which was awesome at the time; of course, it was an upgrade, especially in terms of cameras, but I expected to be blown away, like when I used my wife's S21 Ultra for a little bit. My wife's S21 Ultra works much better, it's more fluid, and she gets better battery life with 5G enabled and WQHD resolution, than me without 5G and on FHD+.
I like the design of S22 Ultra better, but so far performance is crap. It improved after 3 updates, ghosting almost disappeared and battery life is better, but still it's nowhere near S21 Ultra.
I didn't do Smart transfer, I started fresh. Also, I wiped cache partition after a recent update - it noticeably helped. Maybe I should factory reset and give it another try?
Otherwise, I started to think I need to trade in this phone for something else. The only thing that I really like about S22 Ultra is camera, though S21 Ultra is pretty much the same."	N

Dual SIM - Missing Preferred SIM card Settings	"I have seen in videos and images like [this one](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/dual_sim_samsung-13.png) that you should have individual options for phone calls, text messages, and data that let you choose which SIM to use under Preferred SIM Card. I do not have those individual selection options.
Using an eSIM, I see only 1 setting for ""Preferred SIM card"". I can choose the physical SIM or the eSIM to set as my primary, but I can't choose which to use as default separately for calls, texts, and data. Is there any way to turn on the additional options, or do I just need to expect to switch my primary SIM every time I need to do something on the other line? The ""auto data switching"" option is missing as well.
Visual voicemail also seems messed up now. My calling and texting applications seem to let me choose which I want to send from, but I have not tested that yet. If those work, then data appears to be the only thing I cannot change without switching the primary SIM and rebooting. Unless someone knows another way, or if there is some toggle to enable the individual selections."	N

How much does your camera rattle?	I've been a little annoyed about the camera rattle lately. Just turning the phone 90 degrees makes a noticeable sound. There's definitely no need to shake the phone to hear it. I can hear the rattle while just having the phone in my pants pocket while walking	N

[How-to] Force maximum screen brightness in sunlight (no root)	"DISCLAIMER: I will not take responsibility for any possible damage caused by this guide. You are doing everything at your own risk.
----------
By default, if you are using your phone in direct sunlight, the screen brightness won't stay at the maximum level all the time. The brightness will decrease after some time to prevent overheating. This can be annoying if you are outside and can barely see anything on your screen.
However, there's a way to disable this. In this little guide I'll show you how to do this. 
1. Install the App ""Alliance Shield X"" in Play Store.
2. Open the App, create an account and gain access to everything the app demands.
3. Click on ""App Manager"" and search for ""Samsung Device Health Manager Service""
4. Click on this entry and choose the ""activity"" tab
5. There you choose the 2nd entry and select ""open""
6. Enable ""Brightness limit off"" and ""CP TM off""
Now your screen won't decrease its brightness by itself. Keep in mind that your screen/device can get very warm. 
One again, do this at your own risk. I am not sure if the OLED screen can get damaged by the temperatures it might reach."	N
"icloud photos like" experience	"Hi all,
I've been searching for a way to have an icloud photos like experience with my s22.
All I wish for, is to have the ability to store my pictures on the cloud( got a 1tb onedrive account for that) and to view them seamlessly on the phone's gallery.
Is there a good solid way to achieve that?
As I tried syncing my gallery with Onedrive and once I ""freed up space"", the gallery app contained nothing but grayed ""cloud"" thumbnails, needless to say this is poor UX since you can't tell which image you're viewing.
Any tips would be much appreciated!"	N
s22 battery fix?	"Not sure if this is the perfect place to post this or not, and I'm sure its been asked before. But I'm curious,, I got the s22 as a birthday gift, charged it fully, proceeded to use it for 4.5-5 hrs before it needed to charge again.
I would really hate to return it, as it was a gift, so is there a chance there would be an update that would fix this, so the SoT wouldn't be so awful?
If not I'll probably exchange for a s9-10, or is the battery just as bad on those? 
I really like the phone itself, and the camera is amazing! It just seems like a downgrade with the price/battery issue, considering i could get 13hrs out of my last phone, the galaxy a20, While using Bluetooth, Spotify, the usual social media apps all throught the day."	N
Tried looking if there are any updates available and just got this.	"This is my second May update. Base S22 SD.

How is everyone's s22 series now that the dust has settled?	"I have had the s22 ultra snapdragon since launch and I'd like to share my experience to see if it aligns with everyone else's.
Battery life went from 3.5-4 hrs of SoT to roughly 6.5-7 hrs but it took a long time to reach this point. 
Front facing camera was glitchy, it made me look like I had a red filter on and sometimes the front facing camera would vibrate like crazy. A reboot ""fixed"" this issue and I haven't experienced this since the first month but then again I go out of my way to not use my front facing camera. 
The first 5 percent of my battery (100%-95%) and the last 5 percent (5%-0%) depletes in under a minute unless I'm not using the phone. 
The UI is glitchy and I find myself restarting the device more now than ever before. 
Rear camera pictures tend to wash out shadowy areas and the pictures are inferior to my old s21 ultra. 
Constant wifi disconnections to this day....
Im obviously outside the return window but I kept hoping software updates would fix some of these issues. I just want to know is my phone defective or is it similar to your guy's experience. Thanks for listening to my rant that you didn't ask for. I would also love to hear other issues that I didn't list, so I can see if I am also having the same issue."	N
Is the S22 base actually usable?	"I‚Äôm thinking about getting a galaxy s22 to change my iPhone 12, and check this sub and r/Samsung from time to time to read some opinions and experiences.
The thing is, I usually find really mixed and contrary opinions. Some people say the phone‚Äôs battery is trash while some say it‚Äôs OK, and I am having a hard time since I could get the s21 base for 400‚Ç¨ or the base s22 for 560‚Ç¨, just don‚Äôt know what to do.
I‚Äôm by no means a power user and don‚Äôt usually get more than 4 hours SOT, and the iPhone 12 gets me covered for that time.
Just wanna know some opinions."	N
WiFi and mobile data range with s22	"Is it just me, or is the range/signal strength on the s22 worse than most phones?
I just moved from a pixel 5 on T-Mobile to an s22 on Google fi.  Pulling out of my house, I can't stream music until I'm halfway out of my neighborhood, where with the pixel 5 I never had this issue (there's a small dead zone but was way less impactful with the pixel).
I also noticed there's rooms in my house where I used to get WiFi on the pixel but can't get a signal with the s22.
I do have a case and need to test if somehow that's interfering.  But otherwise, I'm getting increasingly frustrated with mobile data.
Also, where I never had problems with apps like map my fitness on the pixel, now I get occasional hiccups where the map of my walk is inaccurate.
Any thoughts?"	N

Samsung said return box empty.	Returned a pristine Fold 3, get an email from Samsung that box was empty. I freaked. They were going to charge me a 1000. Got a hold of chat, told him I have the weight of the box and 2 witnesses watch me pack it. Finally they cleared it up. I've heard others say the same. What is wrong with Samsung?	N

Compatible car phone holder	"Hi,
The side buttons on the new S22 are positioned quite low, which interferes with the two phone holders that I already have. By ""interferes"" I mean that the right side arm of the phone holder is touching and inadvertently presses the power button.
Does anyone have and could recommend a holder that is compatible with the low position of the side buttons? With wireless charging preferably.
Thanks!"	N
True full coverage screen protector?	I just got an S22 (base model) about two weeks ago and I have been disappointed with the small size of the glass screen protectors I have bought for it. They are all barely big enough to cover the screen and leave about a 1.5mm gap around the protector to the edge of the frame. I have bought like three brands and they're all basically the same size. Are there any glass screen protectors that actually go close or all the way up to the edge of the glass and the frame? I do not care if it's case friendly or not. I just want to cover all of the glass. Thanks in advance for any suggestions!	N
where are the original photos located?	"you can always reverts to original after editing a photo. i am curious where those original photos are stored. in ""dcim"" folder you only find the edited version

Anyone tried using the S22 ultra S-pen with our Note 20 Ultra?	"Before anyone asks why: I think the new pen looks nicer because it's matte black. 
Anyway, I need a new pen because mine lags.
Would the new S-pen connect to the note? Is the size any different?"	N
S22 Ultra - Current and future deals?	I'm about to do a trade-in deal - S9+ for S22 Ultra. The Ultra is in my cart with an $800 trade-in credit for my old phone. I haven't shopped for a phone in four years and am really out of the loop. Can I assume that this is about as good as it gets or should I be waiting for Memorial Day to see if there's a better deal? Thanks!	N
VZW Branded S22U - Process to Activate Dual SIM functionality	"One reason of a few main reasons behind me wanting to upgrade to the Samsung S22U is for the dual SIM functionality - so I can carry one phone for both personal (Verizon) and business (TMo) lines.
So, what is the proper, proven way of activating the dual SIM to fit my needs?
Like, is it as simple as going online and linking the S22U's eSIM for my Verizon line and then plugging my TMo SIM card (coming from a OnePlus7 TMo branded device) into the S22U ?
Thanks."	N
Samsung S22 series deal - cracked screen devices have the same trade in value as intact devices + $100 in Samsung accessory credit, and it stacks with the AT&amp;T $800 trade-in bill credit deal.	"Right now Samsung is offering the same enhanced trade-in values for Samsung devices with cracked screens as they are for devices that have intact screens when you purchase a Galaxy S22 series device from Samsung directly. They are also giving you $100 in accessory credits.
From what I understand, the crack can only be on the screen not any other part of the device for instance you can't have a cracked back.
If you finance the device thru ATT, this deal stacks with the AT&amp;T $800 bill credit trade-in deal for trading in a Galaxy S or Note series device in any condition.
If you want to take advantage of this deal, please read these two links below fully. You can ask any questions you have on this thread, but please read these two links first.

i've got a brand new S22+ 3 weeks old. It is really buggy.	"So switching quick from apps is laggy. Twitter as a whole is absolutly horrible to use. Now i hope that this is a case of the variable refresh rate. A specially in between app switching but this is just laggy and buggy as of right now.
Do you guys agree?"	N
What Launcher is everyone using on their S22?	"I go back and forth between oneui launcher and lawnchair and even tried the Nothing Launcher since its annimations are very smooth. I keep finding bugs though like trying to bring up the app tray or I will swipe home to go and open a new app and when I click on the new app icon it just opens the old one. I also had another but when I was using OneUI where if I switched the app drawer to list view some apps didn't show up in the list but when I went to settings &gt; apps the app was there and opened right up.

Dual-Sim on S22 is absolutely infuriating	"I'll admit I'm new to the whole 2 sims 1 phone thing, so I'm not sure if this is something everyone's always dealt with but it's to the point my phone is almost unusable. I have a personal sim with AT&amp;T and a work one with Verizon. I was under the impression whatever I set my ""primary"" sim for data services would pretty much always stay that way except in rare circumstances where it didn't have signal then it would switch to the other one. And I'd prefer to keep my AT&amp;T line primarily 90% of the time.
Except my phone is CONSTANTLY changing it's ""primary"" sim to Verizon despite the fact that Verizon has abysmal signal strength pretty much everywhere I go. I'm literally standing here with 1 bar of lte on Verizon and 5 bars of 5G on AT&amp;T but my phone literally will not let me stay in AT&amp;T.
On top of that I can't use my Google chat features when it's set to Verizon, I miss calls because my signal is so bad calls don't even connect, my data cuts in and out which kicks me out of apps or websites constantly and it's burning through my battery.
I don't know what to do but if anyone has any advice I'd appreciate it."	N

S22 Ultra Order Retention discount not being honored?	"Most of us experienced order delays during S22/S8 Tab preorders. I know from numerous posts on this subreddit that many people who contacted Samsung were offered discounts of 5%, 7% or more in exchange for not canceling their preorders. Has anyone had issues getting these refunds/discounts applied to their order? 
I am being told that the offer I received, 5% off the total order, was capped at a total of $50, which wasn't told to me at the time and is basically half of the $100+ that it should be given my $2000+ order total. I have the whole chat transcript of the offer and there isn't a $50 limit mentioned at any point. Are other people running into this issue?"	N

S22 Plus WiFi dropping/disconnecting - solution	Just spent a week trying to solve the WiFi dropping problems on my new s22 plus. I have now, hopefully, solved the problem which has been stable all day.On my ASUS RT-AX86U router I spotted the phone was shown as connecting to a LAN connection instead of 5Hz wifi.I finally 'Factory Reset' my router and hey presto problen solved.So I think a solution is to:1 - On s22 disconnect from wifi AND remember to also 'Forget' settings.2 - Switch off s22.3 - Factory reset ASUS router (which removes ALL previous settings).4 - Once router has restarted leave for a few minutes to 'settle down'.5 - Switch on s22 connect new connection to wifi.Hopefully this works for others.I am guessing it is something to do with the 'Smart Switch' copying ALL from my previous old S9 phone which copied all settings to new s22+. The router getting confused between my S22+ and old S9. I could be wrong....(Do take note - resetting your router will effect all devices on your wifi network. But, if the SSID (network name) is the same as that prior to resetting the devices should reconnect without much problem - just recreate new wifi network same as old settings (name, password..)	N
S22 Ultra Running Smoothly	It's been 6 weeks since I've received my latest Samsung upgrade and so far ALL IS WELL. Installed the Samsung Screen Protector from the Samsung Store and it was the EASIEST screen protector to install of any device I've ever had!Fits like a charm and works perfectly with my Samsung Leather Case. The directions for installing the SP was mostly using pictures. Those who've never installed or have rarely installed a SP may have trouble following them. Those of us who've installed SP's before won't have any problems.You get 2 screen protectors per box which is enough but I always like having at least 2 backups on hand should the need arise to replace them.I'm getting a day and a half/two days of battery life! I strongly suggest you restrict battery usage of any app you're allowed to and adjusting the battery usage LIMITS in Device Care to achieve optimal battery life. Also, Force stop any app you never used and those you haven't used in a long time. You won't believe the difference it'll make toward extending your uptime.	N

S22 battery life	So I'm thinking I must have got a one in a million unit with my new s22. I got 9 hours of sot over wifi and so far on mobile data only today I'm at 3 hours SOT with 67% left. I'm incredibly happy but also confused because nowhere have I seen anyone getting battery life like this on the base s22. I mostly stream video with a few pictures here and there and browsing the web. All I can think is that maybe the pre-order phones had issues that they caught onto and made the new ones they are sending out better	N
another trade-in scam for s22 ultra	Ordered s22 ultra in marchAfter giving me constant headache with order and waiting for another month i finally got my new phone and sent my old phone inDuring march promotion it showed tradein value of my note 8 at 300 dollars WITH CRACKED SCREENI entered my order multiple times, over multiple days but in the confirmation email it showed that i selected no cracks.So i called tech support to confirm that i am sending a phone with cracked screen and that i will get 300 tradein for itThey confirmed it(and samsung has that conversation recorded that they even listened to itAnd yet. Samsung still decided to be scammy and claim that they dont know what im talking about and that i selected no cracks on screenWhich is a total lie.So with that said, i will not be using or recommending samsung peoducts to anyoneAnd i hope that 65 dollars you get from me is worth losing multiple loyal customers...This would be my last samsung phone..

SwiftKey question	"Hey everyone. I've used SwiftKey on my Samsung phones since I can remember. Since the S22 ultra and SwiftKey, I can't get the clipboard option like I used to by long pressing. I have to click the clipboard icon on SwiftKey, and it doesn't have anything I've copied. 
Used to, it would have the copy/paste/clipboard option and I've somehow lost it. 
When I make Samsung keyboard the default, it pops up like it used to perfectly.

Looking to easily add front &amp; back coverage to case when leaving house	"I have a simple rubber bumper case for around the (all tile floored) house, which just protects it from dropping it on flat surfaces.  This is great for me b/c it keeps it light and responsive at home and there's no plastic on my screen.
When I head out, it's either in my pocket or backpack sleeve, so I would like a way to protect the front and back from getting abraded.  Also, the chances of dropping it on some pointy edge are much higher when out and about (cobblestone streets and uneven Colonial sidewalks!).   A flip front would be fine, but either way, I'd like full screen protection when stowed.  Camera lenses too, ofc.
However, I don't want to pry anything off when I get back home.  Ideally there would be an easily removable, more secure case that would just leave a simple bumper around the sides and back when taken off.
Any ideas?"	N

What's wrong with it?	How long does it take yous to charge your S22 Ultra from 0-100 using a 45w? I still haven't got a 45w adapter, so I'm using a 33w instead. It takes around 1 hr and 30+ minutes to charge from 0-100. Is this normal? Please share your battery charging experiences. Gracias!	N
Unfortunately, I had to switch to iPhone.	"Hello! Hope you guys are doing good.
I have been using Samsung devices for quite a while and my first device was a Note 20 ultra which I switched from an iPhone X. 
I was amazed by the Note‚Äôs design and it got me really impressed. Hence, I switched to Note 20 ultra. I was very happy at that time, and I felt I had a God-like device. I used to show-off to my friends, mainly the display, design and the s-pen tricks. 
But after a while, I noticed the stuttering and lags the phone I was having lately. Added to the stutters, the battery was not okay from day 1! 
Then I did some digging and found, Samsung‚Äôs dual chipsets, and Unfortunately, I had the Exynos 990. The Snapdragon variant 865 plus was much faster and had better battery life. Since then, I have been waiting for a note like device to switch. Finally, S22 Ultra the Snapdragon variant. I traded my Note 20 ultra the very first day of its release. I got the S22, and it didn‚Äôt amaze me much as the Note 20 ultra. May be I got used to the Note framework. All I hoped was a better battery life and the stutter issue as it‚Äôs a Snapdragon chipset. 
But I feel sorry to say this, I experienced the same stuttering and occasional lags when the phone heats. There were many instances the phone was very unreliable. The phone dies instantly once it reaches 5%. Google maps are laggy and the were not accurate and due to the battery drains, I changed all the settings to save battery and my notifications doesn‚Äôt show up.
I had no other choice but to switch to a reliable device. Paying 1900 CAD, for a phone, and I don‚Äôt want to worry that my phone‚Äôs battery is dying. I get a SOT of about 5 hours for a full charge with wifi, location and everything. 
At one point, I couldn‚Äôt trust the phone‚Äôs battery, especially when I‚Äôm on travel and I had to carry a secondary device every time.
Maybe I received a faulty device, I don‚Äôt know.
I had no other way, I sold the S22 ultra and bought an apple device again. This is My first post on reddit, So kindly ignore my grammar.
I‚Äôll miss the S-pen and the UI. It was an awesome experience and I‚Äôll always be a Note Fan."	N

But this snapdragon Gen 8 is insane if you game. The display is incredible for Call of duty mobile or apex legends. I am so happy I got the phone. Even the stylus helps with gaming. If you are a gamer or surfing this subreddit to get information about the s22 ultra I can tell you this. It is amazing for gaming. Absolutely amazing."	N

So far im enjoying the phone and have no issues.	N

Would like to hear what people think of the phone generally too. Haven‚Äôt heard good things about the battery. 
Thanks in advance"	N
Recommendations please! What case compatible screen protector are you using?	As the title asks, what screen protector are you using or have you used? If one didn't work, warn me about that too!	N
What case did you get? Do I go back to an Otterbox Defender? Alternative cases with grip?	"The title pretty much sums it up! I'm far far down the case rabbit hole. I've been an Otterbox defender user for years with multiple phones. Price doesn't really matter. Definitely not looking for anyone to do the shopping for me but if you've used one that I'm interested in or are using one that you think fits my needs lmk! 
**Most important features:** 
1. GRIP 
2. Drop protection
3. Raised edges for Screen/Camera when resting on a flat surface/dropped flat.
**Unessential preferences:**
1. Individual camera lens cut outs are *sexy*.
2. I like minimalist, functional designs. 
3. I'm not a fan of the military/gamer/rugged style cases like most of UAG or Poetic Spartan.
4. I like it thick enough that when my phone gets hot it doesn't bug me like this insignia case. 
**You can stop here!** Past this point I'm just going to go into depth on my thought process with the cases I've considered. I appreciate any feedback!
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I upgraded from the S9+ to the S22 Ultra as a bit of an impulse buy, which is pretty unlike me. I'm super ADHD so I get pretty hyperfixated when buying anything. First I look at EVERYTHING available on the market at the time for whatever type of product and then pour over reviews until I feel I've found THE perfect item. This was different though. In the end, sentiment got the best of me. My birthday is 9/22 and now I have the phones to match hehe
After I picked up my S22 Ultra, I started looking at clear cases because I picked white for the first time and actually wanted to see it. I didn't want to leave best buy completely unprotected so I got a cheap [Insignia](https://bit.ly/3wAiuww) clear case to hold me over. As it is with this level of non-protection I'm *terrified* of dropping my phone. Although, having to use this case for the past 2 weeks I've realized more clearly what features are important to me in a case. The biggest factor has been grip for sure. Using a defender for so long I'm used to being able to prop my phone up on virtually any surface, stays put on an incline like my leg or car dash, doesn't slip out of my pocket when I sit down, in general it feels secure in my hand. I also am super used to being able to just toss my phone down on the desk and not worry about it. 
**Top considerations so far:**
[Caseborne R series](https://bit.ly/3sMktwn)
* This is one of the only cases that I feel like meets almost all my criteria, EXCEPT the most important, which is grip. I'll probably end up buying this one in blue anyway just because I really do like the aesthetic but it still looks like adequate protection. Maybe the sides will be soft enough the grip will be ok? 
[Otterbox Defender](https://bit.ly/3wumlfC)
* Of course, this is the running default. Used previously for a Note 5, S9, and S9+. Meets all functional criteria and has served me for 3 phones with no damage and no real issues other than general wear and tear down the road. The clips to connect the protection layers together have always been kind of a pain, and I've always broken at least 1 or 2 opening the case over its lifetime. The silicon outer layer does warp at the corners after a few years and becomes a little loose but in my experience never enough to affect the functionality and doesn't bug me too much aesthetically. I've read there are ways that you can shrink it back to fit but I've never tried it. Other than that the only con I can think of is that it definitely gets hella dirty under each layer. My phones always go in immaculate and come out pretty dusty/sandy/grimey. I suppose you could clean it more regularly, but I usually don't take the case off for long periods of time because it's kind of a hassle and I always break the clips.
[UAG Plyo series](https://bit.ly/3Nqj1aZ)
* UAG is known for their ruggedness and durability, but I'm not a big fan of the aesthetic for their flagship product lines. So this was a potential clear case alternative, but their product page is lacking. No mention of raised edge depth for the screen or camera and doesn't show a picture that would highlight that. Also doesn't list the material used, but it looks like hard polycarbonate so it seems slippery. 
**Honorable mentions:**
[UAG Civilian series](https://bit.ly/3wrNzUe)
* Aesthetically pleasing especially in the olive color. Pictures show adequate edge depth but like the majority of case offerings for a curved screen these days it doesn't have a real edge on the sides. If you get that awkward sideways landing, definitely a cracked screen. Although even with raised edges on the side dropping your phone on a uneven surface will still damage it. I can't imagine so many case developers would forgo this edge unless product testing deemed it rare enough to be unnecessary.  That being said, in my experience with the Otterbox defender for the S9+ and before they all had big ol' edges so I still look for that.
[dbrand Grip Case (Atomic Edition)](https://dbrand.com/shop/grip/galaxy-s22-ultra-cases-atomic-edition)
* Main feature is grip, individually cut lenses, albeit small it does have raised edges. Unfortunately it doesn't offer a lot of impact protection, it's a mixed bag on the quality front. Some people love it, others think it's flimsy and the sides are too loose. It's also always sold out and takes forever to ship, so there's that. 
[Spigen Crystal Dual](https://bit.ly/3PJdJtl)
* I read in a comment somewhere that the Spigen Crystal series has pretty good grip as a softer plastic or maybe its silicon? It doesn't seem like there's a whole lot of edge or protection but if I were to try a clear case for aesthetic and not functionality this is probably what I'd try. I've never had a case that held my cards so I can't say it's an important feature to me, but who knows maybe i'd like it. 
[Spigen Slim Armor](https://bit.ly/3Px4mfT)
* This was actually one of the first cases I looked at and was very close to getting it. Individual lens cut outs, 3 card storage, edge depth information available etc. The comments that turned me off of it were that the plastic for the card holder was super smooth and shiny so it was slippery but also didn't match the rest of the phone great. Complaints about getting cards out easily, or how 2 cards rattle and 3 cards barely fit. All in all too slippery for the level of protection/functionality.
[Spigen Liquid Air](https://bit.ly/3LoSKZn)
* This one looks great in green, I thought that it might be more grippy from the pattern and material. I get a mixed bag from the reviews, some say it isn't slippery, and others think its really slippy. The other con was that the pattern looks very prone to getting dirty. All in all not enough protection to trust meh grip.

The app battery drain percentages seemed wrong so I decided to sum all of the percentage to see if they match up with my current battery power, and guess what, they do not! I was missing about 25%. So, does anyone knows why is that hidden, or is there a way to see on what that 25% was drained.
One note, I did had Bluetooth in use for about an hour, but I guess it has to be calculated withing the system or something. It's really bad if we can see the full consumption.
On my old Xiaomi, I did the same test and got the perfect result calculating the consumption"	N

Replacing metal hook on strap case	Has anyone considered replacing the metal hook on their strap case? I really like the idea of the strap, but the large metal hook is a bit ugly and have read/seen reviews that it's loud when setting the phone down. I was considering removing it and lightly gluing a wooden dowel rod into the hole where the metal goes through. That would probably keep the strap from sliding out of the case, look better, and be more quiet.	N

Need advice for an S22 Ultra case	"I've had this phone for a couple months now and love it, but I still haven't managed to find a case that I really like. I'm very specific in terms of how I like a case to feel, and this phone is so huge that I'd prefer one that's relatively slim.
These are my criteria for an ideal phone case:
- Slim
- Open buttons
- Hard material
- Textured back (this is extremely important)
I've used the Nillkin Super Frosted Shield case for previous phones, and it was always pretty much perfect as far as I was concerned - it met all my criteria. I'm currently using the S22 Ultra version of the case, but it's a lot different than it used to be. They've kept the textured finish that I love, but it's far bulkier and no longer has open buttons. The closest I can really find to another case is the Spigen Liquid Air, but it's still kind of bulky and the texture doesn't feel good to me. It's also a flexible TPU case, which I don't really like.
This is a shot in the dark, but I was just wondering if anyone here could recommend a case for this phone that fits all my criteria. I've looked everywhere but haven't had any luck."	N

Protect Battery Question	"Ok, I have 2 Galaxy Products  
The Galaxy Tab s7+ and Galaxy s22 Ultra, both with ""Battery Protection"" on, but there's a difference.  
The Galaxy Tab s7+ shows 100% battery, but there is a disclaimer under the protection saying that ""It'll show 100% when in reality, it's at 85%."" and I like it, it kinda makes me forget that I have it activated and feels like I have a full charge despite sacrificing a bit of my battery.  
But the Galaxy s22 Ultra, while it has battery protection on, it doesn't change the percentage displayed like the Tab s7+, it always shows it as ""85%""  
Is there a way to change this to be like my Tab s7+? Where it shows 100% despite it actually being at 85%?  
I know this is a minor complaint, but it bugs me when I'm constantly faced with the fact that there are parts of this thing I'm not using to its fullest. Whether there's an app that goes around this or just a setting I need to toggle, that'd be cool"	N

Is it worth it to upgrade from the s9+ to the s22+?	I have never liked my curved screen and I just cracked it, so debating upgrading. One of the main things holding me back is that it is downgrading from a 1440p display to a 1080p display. People say you cant tell the difference, but when I switch my s9+ from 1440p to 1080p its a night and day difference. Kind of reminds me when people used to say that the human eye cant see beyond 32 frames per second lol. Thanks for any advice	N

Samsung S22+ Screen Flicker in light	"Hey everyone!
Just got the Samsung S22+ the other day and I noticed that the screen flickers when on the menu(black theme) it get a little brighter for a second then goes back to normal and it only seem to happen in daylight, doesn't appear to happen at night or in the dark, I have adaptive brightness off, it's not a major thing just annoying and wanted to ask if I need to return my phone(still in the 14 day cooling off period) I've only noticed it on darker screen like the settings menu(dark theme).
Managed to find out the trigger.
It seems to be the proximity sensor, I used a torch to put light on screen and when turned off it did the flicker.
Is this normal or need replacing?"	N

Is this true? Or he just want me to but fast charger from the store?

Getting the base s22 was the first time I've ever bought a new phone that was a downgrade	"I recently switched from s9 to s22 a few months the ago, and have realized how much of a downgrade it was. 
* Screen resolution
* Lack of notice LEDs
* Screen doesn't always turn off during calls
* Keyboard sucks 
* Some say the battery, but I've honestly thought it's been fine
* Most irritating of all, the ineffective vibration. I've missed so many calls with the phone in my pocket. So stupid 
* Need adapter to use wired headphones
* Noticeably thicker
* Costs more than the s9 did while being a worse phone
I really don't see myself using this phone for 4 years like I did the s9. But I guess that's the point, right?"	N

2 observations regarding the second May update	"I have the Verizon variant of the S22 Ultra, and I've noticed 2 big improvements with this update:
1) Battery life is noticeably improved. 
2) Moving between different zoom levels in the camera is SIGNIFICANTLY smoother than before.
I don't keep track of SOT like a lot of people in here do, so my battery experience is just anecdotal. As an example though, I was down to 91% this morning after 2 hours of YouTube videos and light web browsing. Prior to the update, I would typically be in the low to mid 80s with the same usage. I also went to bed last night with 49% remaining, which is unheard of for me with this phone.
Your mileage may vary, of course. I just thought I'd share my experience."	N

Note 8 to regular S22?	"I'm getting a free s22 with AT&amp;T, and I originally wanted to get the ultra since it's most like the note series, however that doesn't seem to be an option in my special case. I know someone made a post with this question almost a month ago but I didn't see anyone touch up on the questions I had.
&amp;#x200B;
My biggest gripe is the smaller size and battery, is that noticeable for anyone who's had a note 8? Keep in mind I did have a better battery of around 4500 or so. However I heard the S22 lineup has a lot more optimization. 
As for the display resolution, is it worth going from 1440p to 1080p for all the features you'd get?
I'm debating whether or not I want to just.. sell the s22 and my note 8 and just get the S22U like-new. but I'm not sure... The display and 1 hz optimization and of course the amazing zoom quality in the camera from double the megapixels is definitely enticing, but is it really worth it? Should I go through with that plan or just stick with an s22?"	N

For anyone looking for minimal (but excellent) protection... Memumi Slim Case + Apiker Lens &amp; Screen Protector	"I've always been a fan of 0.3mm thin cases from peel or mnml/phnx, but Memumi is a less expensive alternative while still providing a similar feel. I was also looking for a way to protect the metal camera bump and the Apiker lens protector does an excellent job doing so. The adhesive does not leave any air bubbles, preserving the original color of the phone, and it's partial adhesive (none in front of the camera lens) so it probably shouldn't affect picture quality.
Here's some pictures of my S22:

My question is **if I should get the S22 ($550) or A53 ($350)** both on sale from Best Buy. The main features I look for is camera quality and battery life.

Best deal on a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra?	"As long as I've tried to stretch it, my Galaxy Note 9 is coming to the end of its life. I really love this phone and am thinking about the S22 Ultra since it's basically a note.
I haven't purchased a phone since the Note 9 launch and am unsure about good deals/offers going on. Just from clicking online, it looks like trading in my Note 9 through Samsung yields the best deal currently but I was wondering if there are typically better trade-in deals that come up throughout the year.
Appreciate any advice!"	N
what should I pick? the S21 ultra or the S22 plus	I'm in the market to upgrade from the S21+ to either of the 2 phones listed above and would like the opinion/advice of the subreddit on which I should buy.

S22 Ultra, Exynos 2200 vs Snapdragon 8 Gen 1	Hello, I'm planning to buy a S22 Ultra and in the store im planning to go buy it there is the Exynos and the Snapdragon variant, and the difference in price between the two is 300$~. Is it worth paying 300$ more for the Snapdragon, are the differences in camera quality and performance enough to justify that disparity. If this helps I'm not that big of a power user and I don't game at all on my phone but camera quality does mean a lot to me and is very important to me. Thank you in advance for any tips and help! :)	N
Why is w/r in S22U slower than at S9+?	I'm working with external SSD via USB-C&lt;&gt;USB-C cable and with S9+ was writing speed between 200-250MB/s, but with S22U is 20-30MB/s. Also internal storage speed is slower than S9+. Why?	N
Are you happy with your S22 Ultra? Worth it?	"Just sitting here on a Huawei P30 Pro that's about to die (screen ghosting, cracked screen, dead pixels, etc). For some reason these Chinese phones just don't survive very long at all (a while ago my OnePlus phone only lasted about a year). So I'm just gonna switch to Samsung, I feel these are the general premium Android phones (might be wrong, never had one).
I'm pretty set on getting the S22 Ultra, I absolutely love the design (though it's a bit too big for my taste, and a tad heavier than my current phone, but it looks stunning). It has all the features of a flagship phone I want, and a pretty big upgrade from my current phone. I never had a note before (or samsung phone for that matter), but the pen is actually a very cool addition. Not only will it basically replace me using pen+paper at work, I can actually use it to draw digitally (something I've always wanted).
On the other hand it is quite expensive so I was looking at older Samsung Note's as well, but even those aren't that much cheaper (new) and I'm not sure if those are gonna be worthwhile upgrades coming from the Huawei P30.
So questions to those with the S22 Ultra. Are you happy with it? Good / bad points? How is the bluetooth connection? (My huawei phone is terrible and constantly drops out my new Sony earbuds, so I'm hoping for something better) Is the pen notably better from previous Note phones?"	N

Upgrading from a Note 10+ to S22 Ultra?	So basically I see a lot of people saying the s22 ultra is not worth it due to no sd slot, 128g and 8g ram, general unhappiness, etc. I am not a huge samsung person, and long story short I got a s22 ultra 128 for $500. does that price and any upgrade potential from note to ultra make it a better deal than not? I am not sure how much i care about ram, but 128 does seem kinda low for a 1200$ phone, but maybe not for a 500 one. I only have about 160gb out of the 256 filled and i would probably use the note as something of an offline back up device for music and such so I'm not sure the 128 is the worst deal ever, but I'm not a tech guy so I don't want to jump on a phone and find its not a huge upgrade.

Samsung Galaxy S22+ the worst phone ever	"My previous Samsung was ""Innov8"" that was released back in 2008. After that, i swore that i would never EVER buy again Samsung because after just 5 days of usage Innov8, i had dust under my display and Samsung didnt want to accept warranty. Month ago i was forced do purchase new phone because my old one ( Huawei p30 pro which still eats the sh out of any Samsung btw ) got smashed so i wanted to buy new phone. First i purchased Huawei p50 pro BUT i didn't received notifications for certain apps that i need for job, so i had to return it back. Then i was like, its 2022 phones are amazing these days, so i said, da fak lets go with Samsung and that was my mistake.
Camera IS TERRIBLE. THE WORST I EVER SAW ON CELLPHONE. 1 simple photo cant be clear, it stuttera all the time. Like camera has 15 FPS when moving around. Not to mention how entire phone performance is bad. Even scrolling sometimes lags. I've done factory reset, its literally the same. Since im abroad, i've requested some sort of servis where im currently staying, but they told me that it should be in country where i've bought that phone....

Universal dark mode control	To all developers it's time, we need a good lock module that enables dark mode control. an app that let's us select which apps should be toggled on or off, with toggling dark mode in developer options some apps still invert colors and these are normally apps that don't need dark mode anyhow(samsung volume panel, weather and clock widget by Interactive Saudi Arabia and vizorg widget just to name a few, this will help greatly these stubborn companies definitely won't do it so please take a look at this and try and implement quickly, several of us have been asking, commenting, pleading about this. This is a simple app that can save battery and help viewing providing more exposure for apps we don't use for the simple reason of being blinded. It should be a module with all app toggle capability that way if the app doesn't behave properly it doesn't force us to use an app with broken colors at the expense of having the apps we need in dark mode	N

Question/Advice, Note20 Ultra vs. S22 Ultra	"It would take a very long time to explain the whole situation so I'm just going to explain briefly and ask the question I need to ask.
My Note20 Ultra LCD screen broke a couple of weeks ago and I have been working with Asurion and AT&amp;T (phone insurance and carrier) to get the phone repaired/replaced and get a data transfer. They sent me a replacement Note20Ultra for a $250 deductible, but won't pay for a 3rd party to put a temporary screen on my old phone to do a data transfer to the new phone, which is about $100.
But after over a week of dealing with Asurion and AT&amp;T, I was essentially given this offer: I pay for the data transfer out of pocket and return the broken and replacement device. They will then send me a check for around $1500 to buy a new device (the rep over the phone told us we can do whatever with the check and any money left over after we get a new phone) as well as a gift card for our inconvenience.
My question is, should I take the deal and get the new S22 Ultra? Or just get a Note20 Ultra? I have been researching the differences and the only major difference I can find is that the S22 Ultra camera is better. Is it worth the extra money? Are there any issues I should know about?
Thanks everyone."	N

S22 Plus or S21 FE?	"Hi, I'm currently looking to buy a new phone and have narrowed my choices down to the S22+ and the S21 FE.
I'm from Europe, so I'd get the exynos variant for the S22+ but I don't think that's a big deal.
For the S22+ I'd have to pay ~980$ and ~620$ for the S21 FE.
Am I correct that the only real difference is that the S21 FE has a plastic back and the difference in size?
Because both have a 4,500 mAh battery I'd expect the battery life for both to be the same right?
And I heard that there is a slight difference in the quality of pictures.
AFAIK the S21 FE is also getting the 4 years of OS updates, so no issue there.
Are there any differences I am missing here?
Has anybody here tried both phones and knows more about the difference in camera quality and other differences?
Thank you!"	N

Should i buy s22 or switch to iphone?	So i have been an android user ever since my mom bought me my first phone but now that im older im saving up for a new phone i have the Samsung a50 and it has been with me for almost four yrs i was thinking of buying the base model s22 but ive seen the reviews about the battery life and its not that great and i game a lot on my phone and battery life is really important to me but i also dont want to lose the freedom of customizing my phone, it is a hard decision for me and i dont wanna waste 800$ cuz money dont come easy, so should i buy the s22 or switch to iphone?

can this phone use Google photo as a default gallery?	"I was planning to get this phone. I already order a case etc and then I saw it's more expensive at best buy today and saw this review on Verizon.
""Samsung deactivated the ability to default to Google Photos with this phone. Sounds like not a big deal but it is. Using FB can't get to Google Photos at all. Camera won't default to Google Photos. Even more frustrating is VZW personnel don't even know it.""

cracked s22 ultra	so I had to file a claim due to the crack on my s22 ultra and I am paying asurion to fix it for 29 dollars well I submitted it to the ups store in my town which is staples Friday and it had a package of next day air but I haven't received any tracking updates on the tracking number and I was not given one by the ups store so did they pick it up and send it already, also I checked the att asurion website and it says under shipping status device repaired In small texts with nothing else under it besides the line and then outline of the phone but it has no return tracking info does that mean it was received and fixed or is that just basic and I need the phone back soon.

S22 battery life	Hey all, I know I'm probably kicking a dead horse by making this post but I'm interested in the battery situation of just the regular s22 Qualcomm now that it's been a few months. I'm interested in switching because if the deal att has going right now, but I feel coming from a oneplus 7 pro, which I regularly get 7-8 hours of screen on time, most of which is browsing social media and an occasional YouTube video, that I would be getting a significant downgrade when it comes to the battery. I worry because my 7 pro which has a decently higher resolution than the s22, albeit only 90hz, but with a compatible battery capacity of 4000mah vs the s22 3700mah is doing much better than what I've been seeing with everyone else's experience with the s22.	N
Got a great deal on SD S22 Ultra	"Walked into my local best buy this past weekend looking at phones. Had a 128GB S20 Ultra that had been awesome to this point so of course I was interested in the s22. They had the unlocked 128gb for 899.99 USD and Samsung was offering a trade incentive through best buy. Ended up getting 600 in total trade on my S20 Ultra through best buy a gift card and only having to pay the difference on the S22. Great deal and not tied to nay carrier monthly plan. 
Glad I waited. So far so good. Like the note like size od this one. Just wish the Ultra line was flat instead of curved."	N

How are people getting 7 hrs SoT on their S22	I have tried everything I can think of. I've turned auto sync off, Bluetooth, NFC, any kind of wireless share features are off. Wi-Fi/data whichever one I don't need at the time is turned off. I don't game on the device, I use dark mode, keep screen brightness down to what I'd say is about 30%. I always check for apps running in the background that don't need to be. Yet I'm only hitting just over 5 hrs SoT and about 19 hours overall.All I do is watch maybe 20 minutes of YouTube, been watching about 2 hours of Disney plus content and shutting those apps off from running in the background when not in use. An hour to an hour and a half of web browsing daily discontinuous-- ie, 10 minutes here, 30 minutes there, 15 minutes next session, etc.Are the batteries so underpowered on these devices that they'll almost drop by the minute in percentage? What can I do? I feel like my S22 is an awesome phone, but the battery seems way underwhelming. Oh, ans camera use eats A LOT of battery as well.Frustrating cuz it is a great phone but the battery is awful. And if it ever gets down to 5%, you can almost watch the last bit disappear like a 5 second countdown.Anything I can do? Or just deal with the fact these batteries are underpowered compared to the capabilities of the phone?	N

I want to draw diagrams on the screen to explain certain things to prospective clients. Is there is a way to use s pen to draw on phone and it shows on zoom or on screen?"	N
So, why did I buy the S22U?	"I exchanged my S21U + paid $150 (IIRC) to switch to the S22U. I can easily say it is one of the (but not the only) best phones I have used this far. The other was the Nokia Lumia 1520 (though I have had good experiences with the 640XL and to a lesser extent with the 950XL). 
Before I got the S21U, I had the OP6t for about 3 years and that was a very good experience too. And before that I had the Moto Z Play, which was not a bad device but whose battery life made most other phones look silly.
So, why did I buy the S22U? Well, the S22U, to me, is a bit special because of three things.
First is aesthetics. For some reason the looks and the hand-feel of the device appeals to me more than the S21U. I am comparing this with and without a case. The S21U was in a UAG Plasma Ash case and the S22U alternates between the Samsung Clear Kickstand case and the UAG Plyo (also a clear case). Regardless, the S22U for some reason feels better in the hand. I also appreciate the slight increase in the width of the screen.
Second, this is the first phone I have used with an integrated stylus. Yes, one could use the S21U with a stylus and I did, but it was cumbersome. I handwrite notes quite a lot on my iPad and having this capability on the S22U was quite liberating.
Third, I am particularly biased in favour of large screen phones. Most of what I do is interface with the screen. Phone calls are very rare for me. So I appreciate a large and lustrous screen and the S22U does not disappoint in this regard. That said, I have often wondered whether I would opt for a premium mid-range device (like the A series) if the screen size would be the same as the S22U. I say this given how I use the device, which is not as intensive as some of you. I have to say though is m not a fan of curved screens.
So, what do I use the S22U for anyways? Mostly, I use it for social media, for messaging, for Reddit, for web-related stuff, for reading (mostly epubs), for emails and calendaring, for some MS Office-related work, sometimes for taking pics/videos, and, as I mentioned, very occasional phone calls though I do use the device for voice and video calls (on Signal, Telegram, sometimes Skype).
It's also gratifying that Samsung is going to support this device for 4/5 years for I intend to hold on it for sometime - at least 2 years or maybe 3.
To me, though expensive, the S22U is an excellent device which may be a bit of an overkill for my use case, but nevertheless it suits my purposes very well.
So, why did you buy the S22U?"	N

S22 photos in particular conditions with wide angle	"Hi, I'm looking for a new smartphone with top cameras and I took a look at S22 or S22 Ultra.
I'm particularly interested in wide angle camera because I'll use it for take pictures in these situations:
https://imgur.com/qBEN37L 
https://imgur.com/u6BS1sp 
These are views of vehicles chassis, suspension and undercarriage, so are narrow and often dark situations where take pictures.
These are made with an old S7 (and the first using the flash manually to keep it active).
&amp;#x200B;
A wide angle camera in these situations would be useful because I can capture a larger portion but I noticed and in all the S22 series they don't allow you to keep manually activated the flash with the wide angle camera.
Someone suggested me to try the night mode. Sorry for the off topic but I don't have an S22 to try so I tried the night mode of an Oppo Reno 6 and I noticed no differences compared to a normal photo.

And I also noticed that the wide angle on S22 series tends to distort the image on the sides a bit, curving the lines like a fisheye.

No zoom during slow motion?	I loved taking slow motion videos of hummingbirds and other fast moving subjects on my iPhone 7+.I am very surprised that in the slow motion and super slow motion modes on my S22 Ultra, there is no ability to zoom in. That greatly limits the usefulness of these modes. Why can't we use any of the camera lenses for slow motion?Is there some hardware or software limitation that would make this difficult to implement, especially when competitor camera apps have been able to do so for years?

S22 plus unlocked	Hey everyone. I want to buy my mother a new phone for her birthday and thinking of the S22 plus because I can get it on sale in the unlocked version for cheaper. Also I can not buy her a new phone locked to Verizon because I am not on my mothers account. I have never bought an unlocked phone before so how easy is it to activate a new 5g sim card and to activate the new unlocked phone on my mothers account. I live 1200 miles away from her and want to show up on her birthday and give her a new phone. Her old phone is a pixel 2xl so she is in dire need for a new phone. I'll have to all the activating and setting up for her as she is not very tech savvy. I would like some help and tips from those who have activated unlocked phone with Verizon before.	N

The OIS noise when you shake on this is really crazy	Coming from an S21. I shook my phone once and it made a kind of clicking sound.

It's a crazy rattle and you can actually feel it moving in the phone. Just an observation.	N

Battery Care Tip	"When should I charge my phone?
The golden rule is to keep your battery topped up somewhere between 30% and 90% most of the time. Top it up when it drops below 50%, but unplug it before it hits 100%. For this reason, you might want to reconsider leaving it plugged in overnight.
Pushing in the last charge from 80-100% causes a lithium-ion battery to age faster.
Source: techadvisor.com
To take good care of your battery, switch battery protection on. This feature pauses your battery charging when it hits 85%. 
Go to settings and search ""protect battery""
I usually charge my device at around 25%, and unplugs at around 90%. Hope this helps:)"	N
What constitutes heavy, average, and light use?	"I often see these terms (heavy, average, light) being used when discussing SoT. They are meant to indicate the kind of usage the phone is out thru. But what I am not clear about is what these terms mean exactly? What constitutes ""heavy"" use? Is it playing games, taking pics/video, navigation etc? Is ""light"" use just about checking messages? What about scrolling thru Reddit, FB, messaging apps, twitter etc? What about using apps to read books, using Office etc? Or, are the terms (heavy, average, and light) indicative of time that the phone is ending used?
I am asking this to put (for myself mainly) the context for discussions on the S22U's SoT, which seems to be a frequent topic of discussion."	N

After some experimenting I've discovered that streaming Spotify uses more battery than streaming music videos on YouTube..	"After having mediocre battery life of around 4hrs SOT I've managed to find that the culprit was from streaming Spotify 3 hours a day while at work.
I decided to play some music through YouTube with the screen on instead and somehow my SOT has doubled..
I know this is relative because obviously I'm watching videos instead of playing music with the screen off, but how the hell does Spotify use more battery than YouTube which streams and keeps your screen on constantly?
I'm currently at 3hours SOT at 58% battery which is insane as I'm normally at around 20% with 3 hours SOT.
So are there any good Spotify alternatives that don't kill your battery?"	N

Eye comfort shield seems quite misunderstood	"There are articles claiming it is comparable to apple's TrueTone. But as far as I know, it doesn't take local white balance into account. Rather, just the time of day. Which makes me wonder, is it just an over-marketed ""blue light filter""?
And then there are claims that vision booster doesn't even work with eye comfort enabled.
So are we best just to use eye comfort as a blue light filter, set to ONLY custom and specifically only at night? Seems eye comfort shield ADAPTIVE isn't the True Tone fighter we all thought, and actively gets in the way of Vision Booster.
Here's to hoping someone with a better understanding of this feature can talk some sense into me."	N

I tried to download the latest stock firmware of Indian version (SM-S901E) and tried flashing it using odin on to US version (SM-S901U1). But odin says repartion error. I have looked around and could not find a working solution. I do not want to void warranty or root the mobile.

Turn on flashlight or camera with physical buttons?	"just wondering if there is a solution to my semi-minor problem.  
On my s10 there were separate power and bixby buttons.  i had it that a doubleclick on bixby would turn on the flashlight, double click on the other would open the camera.   
for now i have the double click set to camera, and a lock screen icon set to flashlight.  but i would prefer a physical button solution for each.  for the s10+ you could map the bixby button to use triple clicks, or a click and a long click, etc to open different things.  i wasnt sure if there was a similar solution for our single button."

S21 Ultra (Exynos 2100) or S22+ (Snapdragon 8 Gen 1)	Now that the S22 series has had over 3 months in the market, the prices of the previous generation of Samsung flagship models have considerably dropped. I'm currently in the market for a new phone and with my budget, I've got two options: the S21 Ultra (Exynos) or the S22+ (Snapdragon). For almost $60 less the S21U gets me 128 more gigs of storage compared to S22+ and 12 gigs of ram instead of the 8 in S22+. The camera and battery size are better on the S21U from what I've read online. The one real dilemma I face right now is the overheating/efficiency complaints about the Exynos 2100. Seems like the SOC overheats and barely lasts a day with 120Hz and 1440p display. I will be grateful for any advice or suggestions.	N

Is the S22 Ultra the best move for 3 year old S10 owners?	"S10+ served me faithfully for 3 years. Never had an issue that needed troubleshooting. Updates were always smooth, performance consistent, even the battery held on and was still lasting for 6 hours of screen on time. I held out for 3 years. I debated the S22+ and Ultra.
I was 50/50 about it. Majority of reviews said that this is first phone in the last few years that is actually worthy to replace the S10+. I skipped the S20 and S21 series because I felt they didn't offer much I needed. I mainly got the S22U because of trade in offers and I can trade it next year for $1000 off. I got it for $200.
I have a nagging feeling that this was a mistake. That the S10+ could have held on longer. I miss how light it was, the ease of one hand use, and the curviness. I even grew to like the pill selfie cameras. I'm just sad about letting go I guess. I don't know why I grew so attached to the S10 Plus.

S22 Ultra - Always on display disappears despite set to show always	Hello,I have an issue with my S22 Ultra Exynos. I charge the phone overnight on a wireless charging station. Since always on display is turned on and set to always show, I can check the time in case I wake up.Sometimes I wake up and find the screen empty without AOD. Unlocking the phone results in a brief flash and after then the always on display works again. The issue does not happen every night and so far hasn't occurred during the day when the phone is unlocked regularly.I have everything updated, restarted the phone, force stopped AOD then cleared data. Since the last update (may security patch) the issue seems to be less regular.It seems like as the AOD app is either crashing or getting killed in order to save battery - the latter is my suspicion.

MyATT Fingerprints	Hello all, This is one for those of you AT&T subscribers out there, as this involves the MyATT app (the one used to pay your bill, etc.)On my previous devices, I was able to set my login to require a fingerprint, but cannot seem to get this going using my new S22 Ultra 5g (in Red). I am not sure if this is just because this is an unlocked device, or what the issue here is. I have set the login to automatically login, but all this does is make the app not secure, as anyone holding my device could arrantly open this app, and add a line, etc. The place you are supposed to go to enable Fingeer-print security (Manage App Settings) does not have Fingerprint Access listed, as if it cant find this device. The fingerprint reader is working great to unlock the device, and in Microsoft Authenticator, so the failure is not with the hardware.Do any of you S22 Ultra owners, on either locked or unlocked devices have this option? Does anyone in here know how to get it working?Right now, my only option is to un-install the app, then re-install it when I need to pay my bill, and un-install it again. I even tried installing MyATT in the secure folder, but it is "Not optimized" for this.Thanks!	N

New S22 Ultra Owner	"Good morning,
My S22 Ultra in Phantom Black, 512 GB, arrived last night, replacing my S20+ 5G. It took 3 days to arrive from my order/upgrade from a Verizon phone call. I'm on Verizon in the US. 
Out of the box I had 4 system/security updates that needed done. I then did a factory reset, waited for the bloatware to install, then uninstalled it all. I then rebooted and added some of my accounts and apps before I got too tired.
Looks like I lost 3-4% battery over night, which I don't think is too terrible? Can anyone confirm?
Also, how are you measuring screen on time(SOT?). Is there a setting I need to turn on to properly track this?
I have fast charging and super fast charging enabled, but not sure if I have 45W charger, will have to check.
I have all the phone defaults on except I denied location tracking for the moment, it will be on later, I denied the Verizon settings, and I denied all the Samsung permissions in setup, which must be a new screen on this model,  never seen it before.
Battery is now down to 88% from going to bed at 96% last night. I also downloaded several albums on Spotify before I left for work.
Any tips, tricks or concerns I should be aware of?
Thanks!"	N

Is there any way to mute media from the lock screen when nothing is playing	"Sometimes I will be watching a video, then lock my screen and go do something else. When I re-open, in some cases, the video restarts automatically (eg tiktok does this, even if you pause before locking).
I'd like to mute my media from the lock screen, before unlocking, in the cases where I'm at work or somewhere else I'd rather not immediately blare a video.
I know I used to do this on my Pixel 3a, but the S22 doesn't seem to do it. Can I enable this somehow? I can adjust volume from lock screen if Spotify is actively playing, but that doesn't help in this case.

E-Ink Tablet Sync with Phone	I'm hoping someone has already solved this. Does anyone know about an e-ink tablet that either it's native app or some 3rd party app that is full featured can be used ALSO on a Galaxy Note or S22 Ultra and be able to edit those same notes on the phone with the S Pen? This seems like a no-brainer yet I did a little research prior to buying a reMarkable and apparently their app only allows you to view the notes that it syncs not edit them in any way (especially not full featured editing with the s pen)	N

S22 Ultra Wifi Issues - Thinking about returning the phone	"I just go a brand new S22 Ultra through Google Fi and I'm already thinking about returning it.
I set it up at my office and the first 10 minutes were rough. It wouldn't stay connected to the internet, but after around 15 minutes it was working smoothly.
However, when I got home, I couldn't even use WiFi on the phone on my home network. No apps would load despite saying it was connected, then it would drop and say it was connected with no internet.
I did some research, tried things like setting the IP to static, re-adding the network, resetting all network settings, disabling Bluetooth. 
Eventually I started reading the issue was with WiFi 6 and possible 5hz network bands. I went ahead and disabled WiFi 6 and the 5hz bands on my router and the phone was staying connected, but it made things worse in other ways.
I figured out whenever the S22 Ultra was on my WiFi, my desktop computer (which is hardwired into the network) was lagging and dropping packets. I would turn off WiFi on the phone and the computer would be fine and stable.
I was super excited for this phone (my first samsung), but this has put a sour taste in my mouth and now want to go back to a Pixel unless there is some guaranteed reason and fix out there as to why this is happening. It's completely unacceptable a flagship phone at this price-point is having issues with something as basic as WiFi.
Does anyone know about what's going on here?
EDIT: So after some more troubleshooting, I THINK it was because I've been using a raspberry pi (pihole) as my DNS server. I swapped my router back to just using Google's DNS and it's been stable so far. Not really sure how the phone cause the DNS to affect the computers connection. The coupled with making sure WiFi 6 was enabled on both 2.4 and 5hz bands seems to have resolved it. If anyone has any thoughts on the pihole DNS thing I'd be interested in hearing them."	N
Samsung confirmed receipt of old phone but not paid Klarna	HiI am part of the upgrade program. Have been for several years now. I have returned my old phone (approximately 2 months ago) & despite receiving confirmation that my old loan would be paid off this has not been the case. In fact I have been charged for my old phone & new phone by Klarna. I have been passed from pillar to post when trying to contact Samsung & I'm now at my wits end. Does anybody know a number or email that I can use toget in touch with the correct department?Kind RegardsCourtney	N

Help!!!	Can anyone suggest a guide book for instructions on how to use all the features on the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra? I know about the YouTube videos but thry dont cover all the features. Ive had this phone 3 weeks now and still cant figure it out. Thank u	N
Samsungs suck now	Samsung added a stupid dim feature to where if your phone get the tinyest bit warm the screen dims to lower then 30% it will say the brightness is maxed but it doesn't start to dim until u slide it 50%-30% I assume it's because the other s series were getting horrible screen burn my galaxy s10+ had tiktok burnt into it but I'd rather have that then this stupid dim bull**** does anyone know if the s21 or s20 had this issue? I'd rather have my s10+ over this phone I can't play any mobile game or do anything on my phone for to long without it activating they should have a button to turn that feature off if the galaxy s10+ didn't need it the s22 shouldn't either I have to play apex legends mobile and call of duty mobile with my box fan super close to me so my hands are freezing and so am I and the phone doesn't even get hot it just get the slightest bit warm I'll never buy another galaxy phone again	N
Truly happy with my S22 battery now.	"I put it on charger once it hit 10 percent. I ended up with 30 hrs total and 8 hrs SOT with the adaptive battery learning my use plus dialing stuff down when I don't need them.  
For this being the regular S22, I think this is fantastic. I know most of the time it'll probably be a bit less than this, but I've finally found that happy medium of dialing the right stuff down while keeping enough stuff on to get both good performance and battery life. 
I'd gladly take anything even approaching this. Putting those rarely used(but still used once a month or so) apps to deep sleep has helped a ton!! 
For the base S22 I think this is outstanding."	N

New S22 Ultra - I like it!	Yesterday I pulled the trigger on a new black S22 Ultra with 512 GB (I like Video recording in UHD 60 and don't want to run out of storage). So far I am very happy with it. As a Note fan i was feeling at home instantly. I'm trying out the cameras, especially the zoom capabilities are very impressive. The phone feels good in the hand, I like it more than the little bit top heavy S21 Ultra (my personal opinion). It's bigger than my Note 10 but I am getting used to it quite fast. It is a bit slippery though, so it got a cover to protect it. All Updates are installed now, it feels snappy and I did not notice any lags by now (Exynos processor). Maybe it saved me from getting headaches by not being an early buyer a.k.a. beta tester	N
No more RCS is Samsung Messages?	"Pretty much the title, I can't stand Google messages personally. It has been doing this thing we're it isn't downloading mms. I had to restart the whole *** phone just to get a picture to download.

Factory resetting a brand new device.....	"For reference I picked up the s22u 512g unlocked from Samsung.  
It is just sometimes needed. Does it suck having to immediately setup your phone again only a few days after getting it? The answer is yes, it does suck to do this. What makes it harder is Samsungs terrible backup offerings. I got excited when I saw they did encrypted backups now using smart switch. Don't be fooled it's nothing like apples encrypted back ups. You literally have to set everything up again including all your accounts. 
The reasons for the factory reset was mainly the battery. It was like terribly bad, more so than what should be expected. Yes the device learns and all that. After the reset I am at 55% battery with just over 4 hours of SOT. Before the reset I would be at 3-4 SOT with 10-15% left.  
Literally everyone of my apps opened noticably slower than my s21. I did a side by side and I was correct, the s21 opened every app faster than the s22u I just got.  
Wifi was just plain terrible, it was either disconnecting or just laughably slow. When doing speedtests between my devices, s21 5g, iphone 13 pro and this s22u. The s22u was always dead last. At one point I just turned wifi off because my 5g was better.  
I sucked it up and did a factory reset 4 days after getting the device and everything seems to be working as expected. Wifi is faster, apps load as they should and my battery life is doing well. Part of me thinks it may have to do with smart switch transferring all my data from my 13pro. That was the phone I was using most recently for the last few months. Sometimes **** just gets wonky went setting up a device from a different one.  
Just a post about why sometimes this is needed on a new out of the box device."	N
Help! AT&T Trade Denied	I pre-ordered my S22 Ultra back in February. It was during the time when AT&T was running the promotion where you could trade in any galaxy phone, in any condition, and receive an $800 credit. I checked the list and saw that S7 Edge was eligible. I filled out the information, received my new phone, and sent back the old S7 Edge. The screen was cracked on that phone, but according to the promotion it didn't matter. I waited 3 months before deciding to call since they say it can take up to 3 billing cycles to begin to receive credit. But today I called to check up on the status and was told my trade was denied because it was an S7 Edge and was cracked. Please tell me someone else here remembers that promotion or better yet has a screenshot of the terms? I was on the phone with an at&t rep for about an hour and they were totally oblivious to the promotion I was referring to. This really sucks as that promotion was the only reason I even upgraded. My wife upgraded at the same time and is currently receiving her credit under the same promotion. Please help if anyone remembers that promotion.	N
Where is triple tap to magnify screen setting?	On my old Note 10+ there was a setting to enable that allows me to triple tap on the screen to magnify whatever is showing. I found this very useful.

Video Capability Using Multiple Lenses	"I'm currently recording 4k 60hz mode and the issue is that whatever lens I select when recording is started, the video continues to be in that lens only.

Can someone confirm if it is a known issue? Or it is how the lens are supposed to work and it's not considered a issue at all? Or there is a workaround for this, maybe recording in some other mode? 
It's just it feels like a waste to have all these lenses but can't use them in a video."	N

Advice: Pre-order still not shipped (Feb 20, USA). What do?	"Hey Everyone, need some advice/help -- my pre-ordered S22 Ultra from Feb 20th still has not shipped. What would you do?

Actions taken: I have called or chatted with order support at minimum once per week since March.

Car charging challenges - hot days using navigation	"So does anyone have a solution to this issue that if you are driving and combination of using navigation (Waze or G Maps) on a hot sunny day, the sun coming through the windscreen onto the phone essentially causes high temperatures in the phone which then stops the wireless charging.
Often I'll let it cool down then plug the cable into the phone when the power drops but sometimes even that will pause when temperatures peak.  
Sometimes stopping for a toilet break and not using the phone is enough to cool it down before going again but if you are driving 7 to 8 hours you need the charge to work.
So did anyone find a car charger with a fan or some kind of cooling mechanism built into to avoid this?
This is not S22U specific, I experienced it on S21U and with 3 different car chargers."	N

I don't think it was an app - when I changed this previously, I remember using the phones dedicated settings, but I guess I could be wrong.

Just got the May 1, 2022 update (Google Fi). Also general impression after having S22U (512GB) for ~2 weeks	"I'm not sure what changes the update brought, it updated last night.
* I'm very happy with the phone. Performance is good, UI is 
smooth, scrolling is smooth. 
* Battery life is much better than the Pixel 3XL i upgraded from. It  lasts around 1.5-2 days on a full charge. The firt 10% seems to go fast, but I might be imagining that.
* I haven't played much with the camera yet, just a few pics of things for utility and not for photography purposes. 
* I really like how bright the screen can get, it's useful when outdoors. No issues seeing screen content in bright daylight.
* No complaints or issues so far. It was expensive but I don't regret it.
* Haven't used the pen much. I have a tablet with a pen so if I do anything that requires a pen I'd probably use the tablet. But like that  the option is there.
* I got a few cases but no screen protector. No issues with scratches yet, but I'm very careful about it. I haven't had scratching issues on the screens of any previous phones. I may get a different case that provides more protection for the curved edges, the ones I have right now are flush or slightly lower than the curved sides so I'm worried after seeing reports of screens shattering after minor falls.
* My reception is much improved. I used to get horrible reception at home (almost no signal to the point where I couldn't make or receive calls sometimes) and in certain spots in the neighborhood. I switched to Google Fi at the same time as switching to the phone so I'm not sure if it's the carrier or the phone, or both, that is giving me better signal.
* I have paired with Galaxy Buds 2 and Buds live, as well as some over the ear headphones, and pairing and listening to audio over BT is flawless.
I do NOT use facebook, snapchat, whatsapp, or snap. I mainly use Sync (a 3rd party reddit app), Twitter, Slack, gmail, Google Podcasts, Audible, Tidal, and Signal."	N

Do you guys use any other Bixby Routines?	"Below are just the ones that i setup which serves me well,
1. Adaptive Brightness ON: If Button Action is set to ""Press and hold the Volume Up key"", then turn Adaptive Brightness ON (Helps a lot, if you suddenly step out into the sun)
2. Adaptive Brightness OFF: If Button Action is set to ""Press and hold the Volume Down key"", then turn Adaptive Brightness OFF and reduce Brightness to 10%
3. SOT - Increase the ""Screen Time Out"", if particular apps are opened
4. Bluetooth ON: If Bluetooth is connected to a specific device, play music in Samsung Music Player after few seconds
5. Bluetooth OFF: If Bluetooth is disconnected from a specific device, then close Samsung Music Player and turn of Bluetooth
6. 4G ON: If this widget is Tapped, then ""Network mode will change"" to ""LTE"" and ""Mobile Data"" will be ON
7. 4G OFF: If this widget is Tapped, then ""Network mode"" will change to ""3G/2G"" and ""Mobile Data"" will be OFF
8. Location ON/OFF: If certain apps are opened, then this will turn ON the location and when closed, it will reverse
9. Camera &amp; Brightness: If apps like Camera, Adobe Scan etc.. are open, then it will increase Brightness and then reduce the Brightness to normal after closed
10. High Temperature: Using an app called ""Ampere"" which will send notification if the battery temperature reaches 38 ¬∞C, then it will read my custom notification aloud and does the below things,  
a. Processing Speed - Optimized  
b. Wait before next action - 30s  
c. Brightness - 5%  
d. Extra Dim &amp; Power Saving - ON  
e. Mobile Hotspot, NFC &amp; Auto Sync - OFF
11. Normal Temperature: After the above notification received, this will reverse only the necessary actions after 10 mins
12. Battery Low &amp; Full Alert: Similar routine like 11 &amp; 12
13. Play Music: If a particular music player app is opened and Wired Headphone's status is disconnected, then with the help of touch macro after 20 seconds, it will play my favt. playlist (Bixby Voice is incapable of playing music if you don't have Spotify)
I prefer Bixby Voice over Google Assistant, because for setting an alarm/timer or for opening an app or to call someone or to even simply know the time, i can just ask Bixby but with Google Assistant, one would need internet connection"	N

This phone screen is so fragile.	This will be my second time replacing this screen. The first time was no fault of mine and was when I was getting a screen protector put on at at&amp;t(ironic). This time I dropped the phone from no more than 10 inches and the screen spiderwebbed under the screen protector. It's still usable and doesn't seem to have any artifacts besides some discoloration along the lines,but I have never had a flagship model be this aggressively fragile. Especially since Samsung is hailing the phones resilience with its aluminum frame and victus glass.	N

I'm pretty tired, though, of having to wear earbuds or strain to hear the phone in my pocket when weed-whacking, etc.
Actually, I don't really like to have it in my pocket around the house.
Even if I have it ring through Alexa, this doesn't help my weed-whacking ass.  It's really annoying having to be leashed to my phone for hours when I'm trying to get shit done.

Advise needed for tracked stolen S22 Ultra	When in Paris i got robbed from my S22 Ultra. It got switched off straight away but samsung find my mobile is able to track it in offline status and it is sitting in a specific address 2 days after it was stolen. Apart from sending this information to the police (of course no response) is there anything else i can do?	N
Video freezing (S22 base exynos)	"After reading online that people who used smart switch had worse battery drain, I factory reset my phone. Since then I have videos on instagram and youtube freezing with the audio continuing or completely stopping too (not buffering). I dont think it is to do with connection as it is the same on 2 different networks and data, and my download speeds on both networks are 100Mbps. I have also tried clearing cache and reinstalling. Any ideas what it could be?
Edit: Support said"" Just to let you know we are aware of a limited number of Galaxy S22 devices (im assuming exynos) experiencing this kind of situation. But no worries, we have already worked to develop a patch on Galaxy S22 and will release software updates to address the issue soon."""	N

S22 Problem and customer service.	My girlfriend got her S22 about a month ago and it came out of the box with the cameras not working at all it was just a black screen anytime you opened and app to use them. We tried evething and then decided to contact Samsung, and they repaired the issue. She went swimming the other day and the phone fell in the pool for a few seconds (and the pool is only 4ft deep.) she dried it off immediately and later that night the cameras have been foggy and have alot of moisture in them. All 3 and the front facing has fog in it. It has been a week now and they still have some moisture in them and now the fingerprint reader does not work. Its pretty clear it's water damage. But that's where we are torn at what to do. She messaged samsung about warranty and they said water damage voids the warranty. And she told them that they recently had repaired the phone and they said its tested before they ship it back to make sure it meets standards. They are now saying it may cost $110 to repair it again or she could buy the Warranty + program thats more than $200. My personal opinion is she just got a lemon of a phone and it wasn't repaired properly so samsung should just replace it for her but I'm not sure who to go to be able to get a for sure answer. Thank you for anyone willing to give help and with advice on this!	N

Dual sim and 5g UW not supported?	"I have a dual sim installed, esim (Verizon) and physical sim (t-mobile).  This is on a Verizon Galaxy S22 Ultra phone.
With only the t-mobile physical sim installed, I get 5g UW.  With the Verizon sim added (which is restricted to not having 5g UW due to its plan, although this shouldn't be relevant), I can only get 5G without UW even with the Verizon sim disabled.

LDAC will only play 'Best Effort' quality reliably	"I am really starting to think that either LDAC is the biggest con or that Samsung really do not care to implement it properly.
It has been the case for a while now that when you enable LDAC on a Samsung phone that it defaults to the lower quality 'Best Effort' quality setting and that if you change this in developer settings it does not stick and you have to change it EVERY time you connect your headphones.
Also depending on the model often the 660 or 990 setting will just not play reliably which is the case with my S22 where the 660 settings stutters like crazy and is just not usable.
There is plenty of evidence out there that that indicates that the lowest LDAC setting is potentially worse than even SBC (but that is whole other post) There is no APTX or APTX-HD on Samsung phones anymore and AAC is not at all great on Android full stop, it feels like Samsung phones are not a great choice for bluetooth audio."

I use my phone for the following: running a business, developing two more businesses, marketing, photo, video, email, basically anything that is business oriented. Can the normal s22 hold up to running it basically all day, or should I just jump to the ultra? The specs for the ultra seem great, but if I can get away with just the s22 I may go that route.

Even sadder than when I had to let go of my Note 4 eons ago. Literally, the Note 4 had to be stolen for me to let it go. The only memories I have of it are those cute little colored action memos (which I LOVED and that Samsung should bring back) that I created during that period. I feel about the Note 4 how some in the Galaxy on here feel about the Note 10. Anyhow, for those who made the transition from the Note 20 Ultra 5G, what is it like on the other side?

Improving the S22's battery life	"I made a post on this sub about sub-par battery life a few days back on my alt - with 4.5 hours of SOT and 7 hours idle.
This is sort of an update to that. I did a bit of digging and found a couple of things that helped me increase my battery life to around 8 hours SOT + 8 hours idle.
First, I turned off adaptive battery and put all apps I didn't want notifications on in deep sleep, and all apps I didn't want immediate notifications from in sleep (so basically just whatsapp, messages and instagram were left as is).
Second, I turned on developer mode (Settings--&gt;About phone--&gt;Software Information--&gt; Tap on build number 7 times), and enabled ""Suspend execution for cached apps"" in developers tools.
I also did some other stuff like setting up a Bixby routine that turns off the AOD below 40% and turns on 60hz mode and power saving mode below 25% but imo the first two did all the heavy lifting.
Currently sitting at 40% with 4.5 hours SOT and max battery limited to 85%, feels great lol"	N

Heart rate zones is not available in all workouts?	I'm using S22 ultra with GW4 to record workouts, but the heart rate zones information is not always available. The information is visible for some workouts and missing for others. Is there a way to enable it for all workouts?	N
First time letting the phone charge itself to 100% and the results are surprisingly good.	In my 2 months of usage of the standard S22, for the first time I forgot to turn battery protection on to not let it go past 85%, and surprisingly I got at least a 50% improvement from my 100% over my 85% (battery currently at 32% after 4hrs screen on time, in 1 day + 7hrs of usage). Now I wonder if the phone is actually incorrect in thinking that the battery is at 85% when it is actually at, let's say, 70%. I haven't made any other changes recently, so I don't think I will turn the battery protection on moving forward.	N

Some information about the s22 Series	"This is just here to voice out the things that people may not know when choosing to buy an s22, or maybe when wondering why there is so much variation in the phone models. 
This is entirely to inform people, because I just want to put it out there instead of commenting individually. 
There is a ""2 layer"" chip lottery this year. 
On top of the usual Snapdragon or Exynos lottery, there's also a difference between Snapdragon 8gen1 units, because of the low yield at Samsung foundry. It is likely that some s22 units have subpar chips that didn't pass the standard, but are still used to fulfill orders. 
The s22 base model, uses Samsung Display's m10 OLED material for the panel, while the s22+ and ultra use the m11 OLED material for their panels. The m10 is an older technology and is less efficient than m11. 
This may explain the battery issues with the base model, besides the obvious small 3700mah battery size. 
No one can say anything about the general performance and battery life of the s22 series. Because of the chip lottery and differences in location, the phones vary HEAVILY from unit to unit. Of course, everyone's usage also varies. It may not hold much value if one person says their s22+ runs perfect, because the unit you get could be entirely different. It's quite unfortunate. 
Thank you for reading. I just wanted to let people know, I hope this helps anyone out there

hand written note organization tips (s22 ultra)	"Hey guys, 
I absolutely love using the s pen to jot down a quick random thought.  I use it all the time. I currently have 147 notes and am having trouble with organization. 
I saw that I can put them in folders, which is helpful. But the point of it is to quickly write down a random thought and I don't generally go back in and categorize it in the moment. I can go back and do it later, but it is not really easy to tell which notes are in folders already. 
It would be helpful if the notes would either be removed from the main list when it's in another folder, or at least if there was a way to easily see which folder it is in. 
Does anyone know how to make the notes app do what I want? Or maybe know an alternate notes app that works well with it. Or maybe have another organization method that works for them? 
Thanks in advance."	N

Got a S22 plus and think it is better than ultra	"Yes I have both in my hands and I am considering selling my ultra and keep the plus. 
First what ultra does better. 
Camera of ultra is really good. 10x telephoto is great and I will miss it if I sell it. Display of ultra is better resolution wise. 
Then what plus does better. Smaller and round corners are so much more comfortable to hold! 30g in weight is also real. 
What make me want to change is battery life. Yes my ultra is not as durable as plus, not by a huge margin though. Ultra give me 5-6 hours SOT and plus seems slight better at 6-6.5 hours. That is disappointing for ultra which runs hot sometimes for simple web browsing. 
Plus runs less hot than ultra. I seriously think Samsung made SoC is trash. Not only power hungry but with serious quality control problem. My plus came in two to three months later and does run a bit smoother and cooler. 
I hope Qualcomm will send all the fabrication to tsmc. Heard the plus 8 gen one is much better.

I want to switch from Zfold3 to s22+, thoughts?	I have had my Zfold3 since release and I love it. No issues whatsoever. I only cracked the front screen last week and it bothers me.

S22+ scrolling stuttering is ridiculous	"YouTube, reddit, web browsing, anything with content that needs loading will stutter while scrolling through it. What's the point of a 120HZ screen if everything stutters and looks like crap.
I updated the other day to the most recent May 1st update and noticed it gloriously went away for a couple hours! But then came back just as before.
Videos and content play fine, it's just scrolling. The phone is otherwise excellent, albeit with bad battery life but that's a different problem.
Quick googling shows I'm not the only one with this problem, has anyone found a fix or workaround?
edit: spelling"	N
S22 been sitting I warehouse for 35+ days, Samsung doing nothing	"I posted this thread a few weeks ago about my S22 shipping with an incorrect address, and needed it uodated
https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/uiwsks/samsung_wont_update_my_address/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
Over a month since the issue started, and Samsung has done nothing.
Currently my phone is still sitting in a parcel facility near my house.
They can't deliver it because the postcode and suburb is incorrect, and will only update it if Samsung tells them to
I keep calling up Samsung asking them to do this, they say it should be fine, but then nothing happens.
Originally, they said it may take 2-10 business days, but it's now been over a month since I first asked.
Everything I call up, they say they will escalate it, and tell me to wait 2-10 business days from whatever day I'm calling from.
Attempts to speak to a supervisor always fail. They'll only give me a call back in 2 business days from whatever day it happens to be.
Ive gotten no call backs despite being promised multiple times.
Attempts to stay on the line and reason with them ""clearly your process isn't working, can you do anything else"" ""I know you're guaranteeing me it will happen in 10 business days, but I know that's a lie"" either end up with them repeating themselves, or the customer support staff pretending they can't hear me anymore (yes I'm being serious)
Idk what to do. I didn't want to do a charge back on my credit card, since I won't be able to get the savings on the s22 ultra again.
Can anyone give me some advice, I'm losing my mind here."	N
Annecdotal: s22 ultra Battery life	"I recently upgraded from an s20 ultra to the s22 ultra.
I've seen a lot of posts about terrible battery life and I've got to put in my two cents here.
My battery has been just as good, if not better, than my s20 ultra was.
I go nearly a whole day and it gets down to about 20% by end of day, with constant usage!
Streaming music, YouTube, Reddit, and casual web browsing! Not to mention I have the Bluetooth constantly connected to both my galaxy watch and my hearing aids!
I would consider myself a heavy user and this thing just keeps plowing through the day. I don't understand what others are doing to destroy their batter life so quickly.. But, this is just my experience among the many.
Grain of salt blah blah blah."	N
S22 Ultra Battery Seems To Be Getting Worse (Discussion)	"I pre-ordered the S22 Ultra (256GB, 12GB Ram, Snapdragon) and have had it for a couple of months now. I really like the phone and i'm very familiar with Samsung. My previous phone was the Note 10+ and i've had Samsung phones for the past 12 years or so. The Note 10+ also had bad battery life and only got worse every year that passed it seemed like. I make sure to not over charge or charge my phone over night and it still sucks.
The S22 Ultra battery seemed better out of the box at first because it was a brand new phone. It drains battery super quick and it seems that as soon as i take it off the charger it will drop 1% after using my phone for a minute. Then after 5 minutes it drops another 3-4%. Yes, i've done battery optimizing things with apps and other features, but it still doesn't help. I use my phone at it's full capable resolution and refresh rate...i paid for these quality features and i want to take advantage of them. I shouldn't have to turn down my resolution or refresh rate to save battery...Samsung should figure out how to make it all work well together and still be good on the battery. I've also had some camera bugs lately when trying to record a video, it seems like the camera stutters.
I'm not the biggest fan of iPhone, but the battery life on the 13 Pro Max seems to be amazing from what i've seen online. I really want to stay with Samsung, but having bad battery life is a really big deal for me. The fact that my phone retails for $1,300 and can't barely last a quarter of the day is a serious problem in my book. Yes, this phone has a lot of great features, but what's the point of all that if my battery can't handle it.
I know i'm not the only one that is going through this with the Ultra or even the S22 or S22+. Samsung needs to hire a team of people whose main goal is to figure out how to optimize the battery and make it last at least most of the day. I'm not sure if i'll be spending my money on anymore Samsung phones in the future. I love Samsung, but i can't keep getting horrible battery life everytime i ""upgrade""... i'm tired of it."	N
Battery Drain on S22 Ultra	I just got an S22 Ultra yesterday, and the battery is draining really fast, is that normal? If not, how do I fix it?	N
First post, long time supporter.	Hello Everyone,I finally upgrade my Galaxy Note 10 to the S22 Ultra! I've waited years for this phone and it is everything I could imagine. I love every bit of it. Hope everyone has a fun and safe Memorial Day weekend!!	N
Order and delivery delay.	What's the delay with S22 delivery? It's taking 1 month and 5 delay emails and still no phone.Have been a Samsung user for long time but this is ridiculous- I can order an iPhone and have it delivered to me in less than an hour. Why are we paying premium for a phone when customer service is not even close.	N
The difference between auto mode and Expert RAW	It is a matter of practice and recognize objects with good light and shadow, the rest you do it with the camera.1- auto (full screen)2- auto with macro OFF (is excellent to obtain great background blur and great focus = details) (full screen)3- Expert RAW (crop to full screen)4- auto (full screen)5- Expert RAW (crop to full screen)6- The same as the 5 but cropped (full screen)	N
Portrait mode	Dear Samsung,Please add object detection in portrait mode while using Low-key mono, High-key mono effect and studio light. Currently it is detecting only faces	N
Calling issues	Does anybody know is there a way that like with old phones back in day if you block somebody like they could not call through the phone they could not send any messages to the phone and of course nowadays it all goes into your blocked messages folder or blocked calls folder is there any way to permanently block a number where they can't get throughSolved!Go to Solution.

Add USB webcam support for Samsung Dex	Using a Samsung Dex on an external monitor is amazing. It keeps getting better all the time. I'm beginning to use it more than my i5 laptop because it's faster since it features a mobile usability that works better and is more efficient as far as getting things done then a normal computer.Now that we live in a world where video conversations are a major mix in the Communications Department, the need for a webcam on an external monitor for use with Dex is becoming a necessity. I like to plug in a webcam like a Logitech or any other brand into the USB port for use with Zoom and things like that.Can this functionality be added to Samsung Dex? Thanks!	N
"Protect Battery" Percentage Shown	Ok, I have 2 Galaxy ProductsThe Galaxy Tab s7+ and Galaxy s22 Ultra, both with "Battery Protection" on, but there's a difference.The Galaxy Tab s7+ shows 100% battery, but there is a disclaimer under the protection saying that "It'll show 100% when in reality, it's at 85%." and I like it, it kinda makes me forget that I have it activated and feels like I have a full charge despite sacrificing a bit of my battery.But the Galaxy s22 Ultra, while it has battery protection on, it doesn't change the percentage displayed like the Tab s7+, it always shows it as "85%"Is there a way to change this to be like my Tab s7+? Where it shows 100% despite it actually being at 85%?I know this is a minor complaint, but it bugs me when I'm constantly faced with the fact that there are parts of this thing I'm not using to its fullest. Whether there's an app that goes around this or just a setting I need to toggle, that'd be great.	N
Home screen	The default launcher is very lacking, just buy Nova already.	N
Duplicate issues	Does anyone know why even with sinking accounts off I take pictures I'll end up with like five of the same one just over and over and then my photos keep from a long time ago keep uploading again as if they were taken today so I have 7,000 photos in my phone and they're just repetitive cycles also a lot of times with my social media or messaging I'll go through and I'll check everything and go through my messages done and the next day it's lit up again like I hadn't even read any of them I don't know why it keeps repetitively doing the same thing over and over again.	N
Trade-in timing issues?	I received my S22 Ultra on May 26th, I sent my Trade-In S21 Ultra on the same day, May 26, which according to FedEx tracking they should hopefully have tomorrow May 31. They say it takes 5BUSINESS DAYSto check it out which puts that on the LAST DAY of my return period. My question is this:What if I do not hear if my S21 ULTRA has been fully accepted for the trade BEFORE my return period is up? I don't want to get stuck for $1000 trade they gave me PLUS have both devices.This really has me concerned because I just read the fine print in their trade-in FAQ (which was NOT stated on the order page) that any black spots on the screen are NOT acceptable, so I have a feeling it may be rejected for the 1 black spot (pixel ??). The order page mentions nothing about black spots ONLY about a cracked screen.Any experiences with trade-in and return timing issues? As you can see from screen shot there is no mention of dead pixels on the order page.NO MENTION OF BLACK SPOTS	N

Am I being scammed TD bank and Samsung financing	"So... like the title suggests, I don't know if I'm being scammed. I'm getting some red flags, yet things also seems official.
So I purchased an s22ultra in February, with the 24 month samsung financing from the offical site. I put in all my payment info, everything seems good. Fast forward a few months, I'm getting calls that my phone marks as spam from a TD bank. I don't answer for obvious reasons. Recently I get an email from Samsung that my Samsung care payment was unsuccessful, and I owe 11.99. no mention about the s22, despite them being on the same order. I get a letter in the mail a few days ago from TD Bank, it mentions Samsung financing, and that I owe 168. Okay. Different than what Samsung is saying... but I decided ill call the number the letter says, tomorrow and get to the bottom of it (6/1/22) tonight I get a call from TD Bank (phone still flags it as spam) I decide ro answer this time though. A women conforms my name, says she's here to settle my Samsung debt. However, she says I'm only behind $66.
So you can see where it seems legit, TD bank works with Samsung Financing... but my phone marking the number as spam... and the three different amount owed... has me off. Any help?"	N

App crashes, broken GPS, Laggy 120hz, no notifications, the list goes on...	"Got my S22U 1TB (Exynos) about 2 months ago, and haven't been very happy with it due to various issues I've had with it. I'm curious to know if there are other people that had the same experience as me, so if you would be so kind to let me know if you have experienced one or more of these issues, I would greatly appreciate it! -I just want to be sure I haven't got a faulty model, before possibly returning it :(  
\- **No working GPS**; Yes, this has been a more wider known issue on the S22 ultra, and I know that they're working on a fix, but all the articles I've seen on it are 1-2 months old already, so how much longer do I have to wait for my 1650 dollar phone to get a working GPS?
\- **Constant app crashes**; This has only started happening rather recently, but it's still something I wish to adress; I've started getting very frequent app crashes, varying somethwere around 20-40 times a day -At this point I've literally lost count. The apps that crash are usually google apps, such as chrome, gmail, playstore and maps, but the crashes also happen with apps that are not related to Google, although less often. I still doubt this would be a Google Services issue specifically.
\- **Missing notifications (!!!);** I still use my 3 year old old Note9 next to my S22u, because this is the only way I don't miss any Email, Social Media and/or WhatsApp notifications. My S22u has exactly the same notification settings, but gets considerably less notifications than my Note9. Maybe the power saving mode I have turned on at all times has something to do with it, but I also have that enabled on my old Note9.
\- **Horrible battery life**; My 3 year old Note9 (quite hilariously) lasts longer than my S22u. On both phones, I'm always on power saving mode, which disables AOD, keeps the screen at 60fps and limits background activity. I always have the display brightness set to be pretty dim, and never leave any apps running when I don't use them.
\- **Can't connect to Galaxy Watch 4;** My brand new Galaxy Watch 4 randomly disconnected from the phone, and I haven't been able to reconnect it ever since. I've unpaired it from my S22u (big mistake), which caused me to have to reset the watch (wtf, why samsung..?). After resetting (and succesfully connecting it to my S22u via bluetooth), I got to a certain point in the setup process, untill I came across an empty confirmation screen (literally a black screen with 2 buttons: 'decline' and 'accept') where I cannot press 'accept'. Giving the app some time to load isn't an option either, because after a certain amount of time, the watch just times out and disconnects for no reason. I can't tell if this issue is related to my S22u or the watch, but either way it's been driving me crazy &gt;:|
&amp;#x200B;
As a person that loves tech, I was extremely excited to get my S22u after waiting for such a long time. As much as I do not wish to publicly trash this phone, the experience I've had with it in these last 2 months has been nothing but disappointment. If they can't fix these issues within 2 months, I'm going back to my Note 9."	N

Camera stuttering in galaxy s22	Hi. I bought the baby s22 in may, Indian variant. the problem is I am finding heavy lags in camera app in the unit, especially when using outdoors and with increased frequency in portrait mode.

Anyone else find service not great with their s22?	"just picked up my S22 last week.  Prior i had an s10+.  i havent noticed any issues in my home area... but over the weekend i was at our cabin and regularly had snail slow internet speeds.  i was showing 1-2 bars of 4g.  prior trips would load general gifs and images on reddit, not instantaneously, but with very little load times.  this trip, i would open a typical gif and it would take 60+ seconds of loading to open.  other people there had pretty typical load times from what i had with my s10+.  
do these things have known issues with their broadband chipsets or anything?  im really hoping it was some sort of fluke."	N
Only way to Stop a Laggy/Stutter S22	"Ok so, for the past month I have complained about my S22 Ultra stuttering and having lag and apps not staying open in the back,   resetting all settings, wiping cache partition, and removing Goodluck and turning off feature did not work, my phone continued to behave the same exact way, One Ui would lag and stutter, apps would close themselves when I open another app, music would lag when I open another app and the camera was a complete mess to the point that any media will pause until the picture was taken and finished processing. 
Solution: it is as simple as what every samsung Rep says, simply back up your phone and do a factory reset, thats it...
So my steps were, I factory reset my phone, then I did another wipe/reset in the recovery menu, 
I then restored all my data with smartswitch and WOW
No more lag, 
No more stutter, 
Camera does not lag at all, 
My phone now keeps my apps opened and does not crash anymore.
Feels snappy, 
I have restored all my content back, all settings, apps, media and all that
The real solution to the stutter problem is simply factory wiping the phone.
There's probably a bug happening with smartswitch or with the first boot when new that might ve caused corrupted or buggy software ..
Remember: these phone are tested and possibly calibrated before the user has their first boot, and of course they aren't going to waste time going through the set up process, they are probably using a tool to bypass all that and run test, and then forcing the first boot page without properly wiping all the logs and stuff that might ve caused issues with smartswitch when the user receives the phone."

Google play services non sense drain	"Hi guys.
This problem is so annoying I can't figure out how this app is draining like 4% of the battery cycle. My last phone was consuming 2% in the worst case.
Already updated, deleted cache and reset the app. Turned off all those things about nearby share, wifi search and so on.
Checking the running services at developer options this crazy app maintains about 20 services running. Already stopped them but then they come again. 
I don't know what to do more with this app on S22 Exynos. 
Reported this situation to Samsung but their response is always useless. 
Can you check if you have so many services running as well? Check the images below.

Is it worth putting the unlocked firmware on the VZW S22U or leaving it with the carrier firmware?	"I know in the past Verizon has locked some things like the Samsung cloud and Samsung's find my mobile along with other Samsung services with their firmware, and I was wondering if that was still the case and what features I might lose by flashing to the U1 firmware, and even if it's the same process as with previous phones.
Thank you."	N
not sure if it's the phone or car.	So, I've got a 2015 ford focus and I'm having an issue with connecting to the SYNC Bluetooth feature.

Note 10+ Cracked a screen. Switching to the S22 Ultra 128gb. Is the 8gb a deal breaker?	"Note 10 cracked this weekend. I loved my phone but samsung was having a decent deal this memorial day and i decided to upgrade to the Galaxy S22 Ultra.
Watching videos and reviews, everyone is talking how bad the ram size is but no one actually does an actually comparison between the 8gb version and 12gb version"	N
Should I switch to the S22 Ultra or wait for Fold 4?	"**EDIT** I ended up sticking with the Fold. I know I'll be disappointed if I go backwards. Thanks for the advices, it helps to have others thoughts on it, and in the end, at I feel that I made the right choice. Now back to the excitement of anticipating the Fold 4! 
I got my Fold 3 on preorder,  and I absolutely love it. I actually tried to switch to S22 Ultra a while back, but I couldn't tolerate going back to the old style...but last week (or so) my screen protector started bubbling up at the top of the crease, and I saw several people here with screen issues and horror stories about getting it resolved...AND Samsung has that special this weekend (ends today) which they'll give me $975 trade in value for the Fold3...
So I've spent all day today worrying about whether to trade in etc, and watched a bunch of YT comparison videos...and I still don't know what to do (with only a few hours to go!)....
So...what should I do? Keep this and keep babying it, or switch to the S22 Ultra?"	N
Finally, upgrading 4yo phone to S22u, help activating Verizon on the eSIM	"So, I am finally getting rid of my Samsung S9 and treating myself to a S22U (Verizon branded)!  I want to make use of the dual SIM since I often travel to new places &amp; don't mind paying for service from another carrier to increase my chances of having coverage.
So, how exactly do I activate this beast fresh out of the box? And I want to activate my Verizon service on the eSIM so later, I can simply insert a physical SIM from my second carrier.  This is my thought because I have been reading about people having problems activating other carrier's plan on this phone's eSIM when using Verizon, and although I think this could be a thing with factory unlocked phones, I don't want to take a chance.
Thanks!"	N
S22 (ATT) cannot update over the network	I just "upgraded" my phone to an S22 Ultra (AT&amp;T) to discover I cannot do a system update over the network (using data). I've gone through pretty much every setting I can think of, including developer options, and see no where to allow downloads using data. My previous phone, which was considerably cheaper yet seemingly superior, was capable of this. I'll be honest, I regret purchasing the S22 Ultra already. Have I been cozened, and is there anything I can do besides a prompt refund?	N
S22 Series Unlocked US Cellular Roaming	"Can anyone confirm 100 % if the U1 models of the S22 series can roam on US Cellular?

First S22U impressions are...	Honestly pretty damn good. Before I did the newest updates the battery went from 36% to 23% in a matter of 15 minutes or so. But after the update I have easily more than doubled my battery life. Probably more than trippled it. That's even with constantly downloading multiple apps, updates for the apps, 1000 songs to start with on Spotify, taking pics, sending them ect... The heat issue ppl talk about is literally non existent. All of that activity in a very short time and this thing isn't even warm. I'll update this post if things change.	N

Samsung Contacts Does Not Show Exhange Contacts - Just Gmail Acct Contacts - Problem Solved!	1) I recently updated my old Samsung phone to the Samsung S22 Plus. I migrated the phone apps and data, and when I went to contacts - only my primary Gmail account contacts were available.I don't use Google for contacts - only my Exhange accounts, as a result, I could not use voice commands to make calls, etc. Not good.2) I verified the 2 exchange accounts I have were set up in email, and that the account settings were set to sync contacts - but clearly it was not doing so with the contacts app.Interestingly, if I went to the phone app and typed in a name or number, the contact info would come up. So, exchange accts contact data was there, but apparently was not communicating with the Samsung Contacts app.SOLUTION:Since only the Google account contacts were showing/visible, I decided to remove the primary google account from my phone and see what would happen. Problem Solved! The result was that both exchange contacts showed up correctly and functioned as expected. I added back the google account, to the phone and life is good again.Hopefully this will help someone with the similar issues.	N
I can't register the new phone	Hi. I have a problem.

S22 Ultra grey not as pictured	I saw a post earlier about the red but it wouldn't let me reply to that user so I had to make a new post. I ordered an S22 Ultra in platinum grey waited over a month but when I received the phone it was nothing like was seen in the photograph. It arrived this light grey color rather than the light on top fading to a dark grey on bottom as pictured. I purchased my product based on this false advertising. Is there anything that can be done? Samsung representative told me to buy a new phone (I purchased this original on a trade in and do not have 1300 laying around) but what if the next one they send me looks like this also?? She told me they sent me the wrong color so why are they not correcting their mistake by sending me the "right " color and taking this one back?	N

It's been a month.  It's now 5pm where I am, and I'm sitting at 61%.  I'm usually finishing my days now at 60-65%.

my S22U gets delivered today and I'm hype	"I got the S21U on preorder last year. I wasn't thrilled about leaving the Note line, but the preorder deals were just too good. I figured I'd adjust to the whole separate S-Pen thing but I just hate it. I hate that the case options are so limited. I actually hate how big it is. And I have two phones spontaneously die with screen issues. 
I know the S22U isn't a Note.. but I'm so excited to get an integrated S-Pen again. Plus Samsung is giving me $1,000 trade in on my S21U, and a free Galaxy Watch 4. I already have the 4 Classic, but having a smaller watch with no bezzle will probably be great for outdoor activities. So I'm getting a $250 watch, and a brand new flagship phone for $190 (government employee discount).
Sorry that this post doesn't really have a point. I'm just excited."	N

1. Backup all your data using smart switch in PC.
2. Do a factory reset 
3. Restore everything ""**except** **Settings""**.
This factory reset did magic and turned my s22 to be as snappy as it can. Remember not to restore the settings in any form from previous phone. Try restoring only the gallery, messages and contacts. Try installing afresh since most of the app data will be on their respective cloud services.
Note: This also improved my battery performance significantly."	N

I upgraded my S10e to an S22 months ago and I have to say that I am disappointed.
I understand the complaints about the battery, but for the most part it's something I can live with. The one thing I cannot live with is just how insanely hot this phone gets.
Today might be the day that the straw broke the camel's back.. I am trying Diablo Immortal (new game) and running it on this phone at 60fps is an absolute nightmare. It is so hot to the touch that it is concerning. I decided to download the game on my work phone (iPhone 13 mini) and this thing runs like a dream. The phone is cool, maybe a bit luke warm at most while my S22 can cook eggs. I have even tried to play the game at 30fps and it is still hot and battery goes down crazy fast.
Disclaimer that I do NOT like iPhones, especially as my personal device, but at this point I may have no other choice. I did not experience this kind of heat on my s10e."	N
LED Notification when screen is off	"I used Holey Light on my S10+ to great affect. I very much enjoyed the ring light when my screen is off. The different colors let me know what was up without touching my phone until I cleared the notification. 
However, I've loaded it onto my S22 Ultra and it seems to be working swimmingly *except* it doesn't do anything when my screen is off. If I tap the screen the swirl will start again, but when it goes black the swirl turns off.
Anyone use the app? Have any idea what's up with my install? Is there another app that does the same or better?
Thanks in advance."	N
S22 Ultra has such a shit screen	"I've had smart phones for 10 years and I've literally never broken a screen before. Had this phone for less than a month and the screen cracks. Yes it was in a nice case (wallet case so the screen would be protected too). Fell out of my pocket, wallet came open, and landed on concrete.
No insurance.
Does any know of anywhere that I can get ot repaired that won't cost an arm and a leg? $300 to fix the screen is bs for being this cheaply made."	N
[Galaxy s22] Did I get a lemon?	"I have a snapdragon galaxy s22. My geekbench score is just:
**960 single core** 
And
**2764 multi-core*
Even my battery is pretty bad is just runs 12-14 hrs with 3-4hrs sot. 
Did I get a lemon? 
Coz I have seen 3800+ multi-core and 1100+ single core  scores online."	N
The S22+ has been a massive dissapointment	"Let me first say I'm not just trying to crap on Samsung, however I just want to vent because I truly thought the 22+ was going to be the perfect phone. I've had a lot of phones over the years from almost every major brand, Samsung/LG/OnePlus/Google/Motorola and they have all had their pros and cons. Before the 22+ I had the Note20Ultra, and from the very beginning I wasn't a big fan of the Note. I got it because it was nearly free and had top of the line specs, but a lot of the design didn't work for me. It was just too big, the corners were too sharp, and I absolutely hate curved displays, and I found the battery to be extremely disappointing (though I am a power user). With that said, it always seemed to perform well and had a great camera.
So when the 22+ launched it seemed to fix nearly all these problems, slightly smaller, rounded corners, flatter sides and screen, as well as better battery life. my only loss was 50x Zoom that I rarely used anyway, and less RAM, but I assumed the 2 year newer processor would help make up the difference.
Well after 2 months of use, I can safely say this is one of the glitchiest/stuttery and poorly performing phones I have used in YEARS (Probably since the LG G8). Animations lag frequently, apps won't open right away when I click on them or randomly close in the background, and using the gesture navigation is almost useless with how often the phone just ignores my input. Doing any sort of multitasking is absolutely impossible if you want to be able to use the camera app or snapchat, as photos/videos will stutter and lag unless I clear all recent apps. Also I knew that the vibration motor was weak but good God I could be holding this thing IN MY HAND and can't feel it go off, I only ever know i'm getting a call because I can thankfully hear the vibration instead of feel it.
If anyone thinks i'm just exaggerating or have a skewed view, I have an S21 that I use for work and it performs leagues better in almost every way. About the only positive things I can say is that the battery isn't great, but is an improvement over my 20Ultra. it's brighter which I like, and again I absolutely adore the design overall. I'm just so disappointed and I keep hoping that one day a software update will solve these problems."	N
Just ordered s22+	"So, ive just ordered, wanted to get screen protector but on samsung its out of stock. Went to amazon, not a big of choice and most of reviews are that fingerprint doesnt work after applying protector. 
Is it really that bad when you have fingerprint in screen? Like i want to use a fingerprint in 2022, but not to use a phone without a screen protector. 
Thinking of getting a refund just cuz of this thing, feels bad"	N
S22 regular brand new vs S21 Ultra used (same price)?	" 
So I've got the choice to either trade up for an S21U 12/256, or an S22 regular 8/128, both for $250.
The S22 is brand new and I get to choose the colour.
The S21U is used, black, and has a scratch on the backside.
Pros of S21U:  
\-Larger 2k screen  
\-Edges  
\-More storage and RAM  
\-10x zoom  
\-Larger battery (though used for a year)
Pros of S22:  
\-Brand new  
\-Colour of my choice (I don't like black)  
\-A lot easier to hold, carry (especially in front pockets)  
\-Better low light photography (apparently)  
\-Newer SOC  
\-1 more android update
The most important thing for me is the camera, specifically the main camera. I use the phone a lot for video and pictures and almost never use the other cameras (lenses) because the main camera is just vastly superior to the other gimmicky cameras.  
How's the main camera of the regular S22 compared to the S21U and even the S22U?
I know everyone complains about battery life, but is it really that bad? I get 8h screen-on-time with my S21+ because I only ever use it on wifi, no AOD, so I basically recharge it every 3 days. However, when I need to capture video or take pictures the entire day, even in 1080p, I have to recharge it during the day.
I have no issues with holding the S21U or even the S22U. I have average hands, but have no issues with holding the phones. However, the S21+ is really bothersome in my front pockets. Whenever I bend down to tie my shoelaces, or even just when sitting in the car, it's just...very noticeable. However, I do really like the larger screen."	N

Samsung Gallery still lacks HDR support for photos	"Even though Samsung phones have the brightest displays on the market , they aren't fully utilized to their potential. Take for example the Gallery app and how it shows pictures. Now , there's nothing wrong with it but when you compare with the iPhone Photos app you start to see some differences , especially in HDR. When you take a picture of the sky on the iPhone and view it , you can see that the UI dimms down , the sun is the brightest object followed by some highlights on the clouds while the sky is displayed in ""standard"" brightness. On the Samsung Gallery app you don't see this effect, it just looks flatter compared. That effect really makes the picture come alive on iPhones. Samsung can play HDR video perfectly but when it comes to photos , they just show a regular SDR version without that extra pop of highlight and contrast. 
Now if you use Expert Raw and Lightroom , the photos will display in Full HDR mode on the Galaxy."	N

Series of disappointment	"Hi guys,
So I finally got to the point where I just need to share my opinion on S22 Base Exynos
It has been quite a disappointment after 2,5 months of using it. 
Starting with a battery that hasn't really improved significantly, still quite unable to reach 3h sot. (No games, dark mode, 120hz, light usage).
The phone heats up when having a call, it's uncomfortable holding it by the ear. It's heating up extremely when using Android Auto, up to the point where all of my apps got closed due to the heat. I'm using cable AA but even though it's charging, occasionally it's discharging faster than charging which never happened to me before. (I was using OnePlus 6 before). 
I had a manual routine for when I get to sleep that should also turn off wifi but it doesn't  work anymore for some reason. 
This morning I couldn't turn off the alarm, and when I finally managed to do that, i couldn't really do anything on the phone other than unlock it... 
I'm thinking about contacting the customer service but my hopes are low than it will actually help or something will change. 
It's the most expensive phone I got so far and yet it's the worst. I was planning on getting iPhone 13 that I also tested but it turned out apple car play was not supported in my car :("	N

Upgrading from Note10+ to S22+	"Hello everyone!
As the title says, I am planning to upgrade to the S22+ from the Note10+ but I want some feedback from the S22+ owners about their experience with the device so far. Especially from those who did this exact upgrade.
The main reason I am making this post is to check for a very specific issue that I am having on my Note10+ that I hope every S22+ user does not experience. That is the ridiculous battery drain when having bad cellular signal. I work as a field engineer where we most likely have bad cellular connectivity and I want to know if the S22+ experience anything like that.
Also related to that, another issue that I faced is whenever one of the 2 sims that I have in the phone drops the signal and fetches for a signal, the network data of the other sim stops working completely till the other sim is able find a cellular signal.
I know its a long post for a very niche problem but believe me, when you are alone at work in a very remote location for a long period of time it can drives you crazy!

S22 ultra screen cracked toady after 2 months	"In the most freakish accident, sitting on the beach, my phone which have the Samsung clear standing cover, and a plastic-ish screen protector fell on the sand, unfortunately it fell on a small pebble on the very curved side of the phone, and Boom at is simply cracked. It is thankfully 100% usable, even with the s pen, not sure if it  water proof or not. But I felt the crack deep in me :( 
Compared to my previous Note 10, which have fell many a times, it seems that the bigger screen is less strong especially on the curvy sides.
Tip for users: maybe a panzer glass screen protector is a good thing to have. It will make the sceen look not as good, but better safe then sorry."	N

any risk of yellowing/losing color "vibrance" on the S22 ultra ?	"Hi there ! 
I just had a quick question because I'm really struggling to make a choice between the green and the white model. 
The green one looks really good with the color shift with different light angles, but the white looks so premium and bright, I want to give it a shot but I'm scared that the white could lose its ""whiteness"". I don't know if this sounds clear or not, but I can't find any white models out here to see the color in person.
Is there someone with a white model willing to tell me if they feel like there's any risk of the color losing its whiteness and flashiness ? 
Thanks :)"	N

So Frustrated...anything i can do to improve the battery of base S22 SD ?	"It has been 3 months since i am using S22. I absolutely love the phone and i got it for around 500 USD after exchanging my 3 yr old s10 and using credit card offers (Indian Variant).  Battery has never been good. But since i was working from home it was ok. I always used wifi and followed pretty much all the things i can do to improve battery. Like put apps to sleep and stuff. Today i had to go to some place far using public transport and i didnt carry a charger or power pack. I left my home at 5.20 AM with 100%. The phone was on 4g all the time and i wasnt using the phone much too. By 10.30 AM i had 35 mins screen on time and the battery was at 50%. By 3PM i had 10% left with 1hr 12 min screen on time. Most battery consumed item was google play services with around 12 %. Play services never used to consume this much battery when i was using my phone at home. I used uber and maps a little bit too like 10 to 15 mins. I had to borrow a charger from some one and charge it during my way back home in a train..I hardly used the phone. Also my galaxy watch 4 was connected to it all the time.
Is there anyway to improve the battery life other than normal deepsleep app and turn off location stuff? I heard resetting fixed some peoples battery issues. I am so frustrated. If i cant go out with my phone without a charger then it is useless. No point in having it. I love the phone in all other aspects. I kind of regret now that i didnt buy iphone 13. My 3yr old s10 had better backup than s22. Pathetic. Any advices and suggestions are welcome...."	N

Bad experience with S22	"I just bought an s22 exynos (no other options in my country) and had the worst experience with a phone.
It doesent have high and ultra options on pubg mobile,and even on high it runs choppy. Call of duty also runs worse than on my s10 (also exynos). Recording 5 min on 4k 60 fps gets the phone so hot to the point i can barely hold it. I cant belive i paid an obscene amount of money to have a worse experience than i had on my s10.
Antutu scores 800k point on the first run, then 400-600k.

Battery not that bad Base S22 (SD)	"Some days the battery does a great job and on some days i barely get 4hours of SOT.

I tweaked a few settings and set up a few Bixby routines. I get at least 4.5hours of SOT and best case scenario just touching 6hours. I think this is the max i can get with the battery capacity and my usage. 
Just fyi. I've been on wifi the entire day today with mobile data off but from what I've observed, even when I'm out with mobile data on(5G disabled) i get around 4.5hours of SOT

Does Samsung really care for environment in the name of removing Charger?	"  
Apple started the claim of reducing carbon footprint by removing the charger. While initially Samsung mocked apple, now they have mostly removed charging adapter from most of the phones. see how I found this environment care claim is so bogus. I bought recently s22 which supports 45w charging support but dint come with any charging brick. I was using s10 phone which just shipped with 15w charger. Hence, I had to order a 45w charger. Now lets see the environment carbon footprint trail due to this decision:
1. Logistics involved with shipping of new charger.
2. The box, the extra box by amazon and other plastics that came with the new charger box.
3. addition price I had to pay from my pocket for the charger for an 77,000 INR phone.
Now, everyone knows that charging capacity would just be increasing with passage of time and consumer would be forced to buy additional charger.
Samsung, you are not doing any favour to the environment. You are just inducing further carbon footprint by passing it on to the consumers in a deteriorating way."	N
Solution To Battery Life Issue on All S22 Models	"TL;DR: Never had a problem with the battery life except with the recent s22 Ultra, I usually have battery limit at 85% but always carry a Samsung USB-C portable battery bank with me for video shoots, also disabled ALL social media apps from running in the background. Problem solved.
Little background on me, I'm 40 years old and I have bought every new Samsung phone since the S9 Plus, never owned a note but I did get the S21 Ultra last year and I always get the best version by trading in the previous year's model.
I did trade in my S21 Ultra so now I have the S22 Ultra Snapdragon version.
I've noticed decreased battery life compared to my old one and let's face it, there are a lot of YouTube videos that compare the battery life from the old Ultra to the new Ultra.
Some YouTube videos show the Snapdragon version or the exynos versions, but both show that the newer versions of either chip type have reduced battery life compared to last year's. 
That fact is not debated on any website or video from what I have seen since February.
In regards to the budget versions of the S22 like the non-plus or Plus version, everybody seems to be in agreement that those have the worst battery life.
I'm a firm believer that the non Ultra versions of this latest model are for kids because I like having the S Pen and I also like the bigger battery I always have.
Let's be serious, even though they have slightly smaller screens, S22 and S22Plus are still running at a high refresh rate, and depending on the brightness they're going to drain pretty quickly. 
Even the ultra does this if you're not careful with the brightness settings. Unless I'm outside with the sun directly over me I don't put the brightness above 60% and trust me, your phone gets pretty warm on front and back when you're walking on outside in Arizona at 60% brightness.
This thing about battery life improving over time, I don't necessarily believe it and I use a program that tells me my screen on and Screen Off time called Accu battery.
Unfortunately this is one of those types of phones where it helps to have a portable battery and I purchased one of those 20,000 milliamp Samsung fast Chargers on eBay since they're very difficult to get off of the main website.
20,000 mAh Battery Pack PD, Dark Gray
https://k7wz8.app.goo.gl/rSJpcFBn1wAv8eeb7
There is a 10,000 milliamp Wireless version but I don't like Wireless, they take too long to charge and I know what you're going to say, yes even though there is a USB C connector on the wireless, why waste your money just get the big battery and be done.
I heard the exynos has even more speed and Battery problems than the Snapdragon version so unless you're not running a lot of apps in the background, you will definitely find reduced battery life.
I've actually been running my S22 Ultra with the battery protect mode on, so it limits it to 85% but I keep it plugged in at the office.
The rare exception where I charge it to 100% is when I'm planning on doing filming or taking a lot of photos because I don't like to be connected to a portable battery charger which heats up the phone and can make the video stutter a bit.
I don't know what you guys are doing that you keep running out of battery during the day? Aren't you always near an outlet? Don't you have a portable battery Bank?
I don't do gaming and what I will typically do is whenever I go somewhere where I'm not near an outlet I'll just plug my phone into my portable battery bank and put it on the table, for instance when I'm having lunch.
That's really all I need, a 3 foot charging cable, and the Samsung battery I mentioned.
I really don't understand why people are running out of battery power these days, just get a portable charger and hope that the manufacturer of whatever phone you buy improves the battery life so you don't need your portable charger.
I'm also looking ten years out into the future when most places will have USB C connectors to connect directly into your phone to charge them, and even when I'm on the bus I have my portable battery charger so I really don't run out or low on battery.
I read something about how Samsung created the Snapdragon microchips this time around, so this might improve with a different manufacturer of the Snapdragon microchips. 
Either way, unless you're doing a lot of heavy stuff on your phone, you shouldn't be running out or low of battery unless you're doing long periods of gaming or video or pictures without connection to a battery Bank. 
Please get one, they are amazing when the power goes out during a storm, you can charge more than one phone with it.
And one of the best suggestions I can give you is to turn off Facebook, Twitter and Instagram and anything else on social media so that way if you want updates you actually have to open the app to check.
Again and I cannot stress this enough, do not let these apps ever run in the background, open them up, check your messages, reply to them and then close it.
Who gives a darn about Facebook going off every second, just open it up on a break and see if you got any messages, otherwise you're going to be distracted and your social media apps all use a lot of battery.
That was one of the best decisions I ever made, turning off those apps I'm running in the background and wasting 10% battery power an hour.
If this helped you please give me a positive note, it's Sunday and I wanted to spend a good amount of time helping out the community with an issue that I also faced."	N

Question about taking carrier specific S22U to another carrier	"Hi all. I am currently in the market for a S22 Ultra coming from a Note 8. I hope what I'm going to ask isn't too stupid of a question - I tried searching around. For my entire cell phone ownership, I've always had Verizon. At the moment AT&amp;T is offering the best trade-in for my old phone at $800 off compared to Verizon's $400, so I am tempted. 
&amp;#x200B;
My question is can the carrier specific S22 Ultra work on other networks if I decide to switch? I was thinking of possibly biting for the AT&amp;T deal. I am worried though that I might not be satisfied with the AT&amp;T coverage. So if I am not satisfied with the network, ideally I would like to be able to return to Verizon with the phone. Just wondering if this is doable. I understand there are unlocked phones from Samsung, but they would offer even less trade in ($250) for my Note 8 than verizon so that is not ideal. Thank you!"	N

You spend 1k on phone and you still get such problems nowadays? Not like they are making phone for first year.
Anyway today came my s22+, dpd guy even dropped it on floor, didnt even open the box to check the phone, sadly. Went straight to return parcel spot.

Have you tried the Nothing launcher?	"My s22 plus and ultra suffer from random lag and hiccups when using the phone. Especially when switching apps or pages like Google discover page. I thought it was bad SoC and over heating and execution etc. But when I switched to Nothing Launcher (Google store for free). I found one UI launcher might be the problem.  
Nothing launcher gives you pixel like icons and super simple layouts. You will have no lags and hiccups afterwards. But you will lose Google discover page and double tap to turn off screen. 
Up to you I would not say one UI launcher is worse. It is with more functionality. But if you want a quick and fluidic experience try nothing launcher"	N

Considering getting an s22 or s22+, how is battery life and general stability with current updates on Snapdragon Models?	I am coming from a Oneplus 6t, and if feels like the stuff im reading about the s22/s22+ is all over the place. Some posts say the battery life is great, some say its abhorrent! Some say the camera is amazing, some say it lags for 5 seconds when trying to take a photo. Im tired of android phones that always seem to have weird issues like this, do the s22's still have inconsistent issues? Im considering ios for the first time since it seems to be a lot more consistent and stable and problem free but I really don't want to switch to ios. I just want a phone that has great battery life, and doesn't stutter/lag when doing normal tasks. My friend took a video at a concert with an iphone 11 and the camera app opened immediately and she started taking a video with literally ZERO lag or stuttering which I have never seen before on a phone, my 6t takes nearly 7-8 seconds to just start taking a video in similar conditions and im tired of that.

And the major discount is honey. If you sign up and add the honey extension to your browser, there will be a pop up when you go to the buy s22 ultra page.
Click activate offer. And you will get 20,000 honey gold ($200) which can be sent to your bank account via PayPal. 
Another discount that worked for me when I got my note 20u was to try to cancel your order. This will give you an additional 10% off but it only works on new accounts. (So if u can't get a student account this essentially gives you the student discount) 
I hope this helps you all. I will certainly be taking advantage of this solely for the price, the note 20u is still a great phone but a $37 upgrade is a no brainer for me."	N
I just traded in my N20 Ultra for S22 Ultra.. and I'm kinda regretting it.	"So I dropped my N20 from like 13 feet high when getting off an amusement ride. Thank god it didn't crack or get damaged AT ALL. My case was one of those clear ones which cracked upon impact but it didn't let my phone get damaged. I was worried about the phone being damaged internally though because I noticed little hiccups and glitches here and there. So when I saw that samsung had a memorial day sale with $800 instant trade in for my Note AND a free galaxy watch 4, I jumped on it. 
Well lo and behold, the glitches I noticed on my note on certain apps, I'm noticing them now on my S22 Ultra which made me realize that it wasn't my Note that was the issue. Another thing I'm noticing is the S22 heats up pretty easily which is an issue since I live in AZ and it makes using the phone outside a real concern. Also, I'm really missing my SD card slot (wtf samsung?). So I'm not sure what to do, because I like the watch and that on its own is $250 bucks. The phone with the free watch was around $400 bucks. So I don't know what to do at this point. What do you guys think? 
Should I ditch the phone and buy the watch separately or keep the phone and trade it in later when a better phone comes out?
Edit: Btw, I haven't returned my Note yet so I have time to decide."	N

S22 Ultra	I've had the S20+, S21 Ultra, and now the S22 Ultra. The antenna must be super small in this new phone. I live in rural Mississippi and places I've always had service (same carrier) I have zero service with this phone. The service wasn't terrific on the other phones, but I could receive and send text messages and have the occasional call. With the S22 Ultra, nothing. I am missing many of text messages. Is there possibly a setting somewhere that may help with better reception that is equivalent to the S20 and 21?Thanks, Chad Robertson	N

New S22+	I absolutely love my S22 +, except for the color anyway. This is the second one I have bought...I really loved the custom color of my first one, it was Phantom Lilac, but it had major battery issues.. it would get extremely hot when using a travel adapter and then it would barely charge at all on a wireless charger.. For ANYONE ELSE PURCHASING a S22, S22+, OR ULTRA- READ THE CHARGING INSTRUCTIONS CLOSELY... THE S22+ NEEDS A 25 WT TRAVEL ADAPTER TO CHARGE PROPERLY AND IT DOES NOT COME WITH THE PHONE!!!

Observations after a week with my S22U compared to my N20U... Agree? Disagree? Add your own thoughts	"So finally unboxing my phone and setting it up and using it for a week I am getting to get familiar with it and notice things about the S22U and some compared against the N20U and thought I'd use a post to share little comments and observations and see if people agree and also notice or disagree or have some observations of their own they found compared to their previous phone?? 
1. 2nd gen FPS is on a whole another level better than the previous gen on my N20U and Note 8. I thought N20U was much better cause Note 8 FPS was trash but the S22U even if Spigen NeoFlex protector I rank up there with FaceID working on my iPhone or even as well as capacitive FPS on older iPhones. Note, I have very thin prints skin and prints on my fingers are super thin and on top of that get dry at time so prints get dry and crackly so always been a problem on the Samsungs. Never an issue with capacitive sensors. So this as been an extra bonus to upgrading my phone for me. 
2. Volume on S22U... not as loud as the volume on my Note 20U? I'm thinking if it's just as loud... definitely not louder at max. But when watching YouTube in back of my mind think it's not as loud as max on my Note 20U. 
3. Cameras improved over the N20U. Overall quality of the pics of few shots, the detail and color seems improved so I'm happy with upgrading my phone since that was my primary reason. 
4. Display not washed out in landscape mode when wearing sunglasses with polarized lenses compared to my Note 8. A Note (pun intended) I found interesting I wear RayBans with polarized lenses and with my Note 8 if I rotate to landscape the display gets washed out and unviewable. But with the S22U panel, I can look at screen in portrait or landscape and display stays clear and sharp. 
5: Haptic/Vibration motor on S22U weak... borderline trash?? Definitely noticed this as I start getting more use and carrying around and getting message notifications. Weak is an understatement. Even when laying on a surface. I think I just turned it off then waste any more battery on it. 
Overall a good successor to the Note 20U. Worth it if you can get a good deal on your older phone or trade."	N

Which app to download new Samsung smart watch faces?	When I used to use the Note 10+ phone, there was an app I used to download and install new Samsung watch faces. I can't find that app, anyone know the name of it? The app would show me various watch face designs that I can see on my smartphone screen before deciding to download. My favorite watch faces were digital faces showing lots of features, I think the author's name is "IRIS"? and watch face names are listed as IRIS15, IRIS16, etc. I have the older Samsung smart watch (version#3?) from about 2 years ago. If someone can point me in the right direction to find the app to install different watch faces, I would appreciate that. If the app exists in my current Ultra 22 plus, what is that?

S22 Ultra Resetting	"So I have had my S22 Ultra for a month.  In the past week it kept becoming non-responsive and just resetting itself.  I brushed off the first couple times it did this, but it got to the point where it was doing it once or twice a day.  
I spoke with Samsung and they suggested the usual remedies such as running in safe mode for a couple hours (done) then after that failed, they asked me to perform a factory reset, which I did on Thursday last week.  Today is Tuesday and this morning the screen froze again and the phone restarted itself.  
Interestingly, it didn't have this error for the first couple weeks of ownership, which maybe suggests it might be an incorrectly functioning app.  But there doesn't seem to be any way of checking which app causes it.  It would be impractical to uninstall all apps, and add one at a time and just leave it a few days to monitor, before adding the next one.  I have c100 apps.
It has done it while using different apps.  Today I was in the Samsung Browser when it reset. 
Samsung said last week, that if it did it again, I would need to send it off for repair. 
I'm exasperated over this üò©.  I was a long term iPhone user drawn by many of the superior features on Samsung, and had gotten to the point where I preferred it to the iPhone.  But following probably 10 error-induced-restarts, I'm at the point of thinking of throwing in the towel and just going back to Apple.    Unfortunately, Samsung only offer 21 days for a refund, so I'm behind this point now, which means they wont replace or take a return.  
Honestly, I prefer Samsung and Android to iPhone, but I can't have a phone that randomly and regularly crashes and restarts.
Any other suggestions to fix this?
For info - I have the Exynos version, with 256gb."	N

Cases for the S22U Ultra	"Title. Wondering what case to grab for my phone, so far I have been running it without any case or screen protector and while it feels nice in the hand, I do feel anxious holding it outside on concrete for example.
My current options are Rhinoshield's SolidSuit case or just a folding case from a local shop. I would have the Rhino case already but heard it is slippy? Also if it had some sort of stand that would be cool as well, for using the phone on a table or watching something.

Improvement after factory reset. S22 SD (256)	"So I did a setting reset after reading a few threads in here which seemed to have increased my SOT and a bit of smoothness but i wasn't fully satisfied with it. Later I read few more threads stating that earlier phones are having issues and they are getting resolved by a factory reset. As mine was a pre order and received it back in March itself. I did a factory reset and it greatly improved the performance overall. There's no shutter lag anymore, Snapchat doesn't stutter anymore and I can feel it's smoother than before. 
The only issue which I'm still facing is heating issues. It still heats alot and loves to average 39-40¬∞C but i think it's because of the temperature in my city. It's pretty hot here and temperature rises upto 43¬∞C during day. 
If there's any fix regarding temprature issues please let me know.
TLDR: performance improved overall after a factory reset and no shutter lag and Snapchat doesn't lag anymore. But it still heats and stays between 38-43 degree celcius."	N

Does warranty cover water damage?	Hello. My screen is flickering after I wiped it down with a damp towel a few hours ago. I had turned the phone off and set it aside to dry. I'm disappointed that this happened since the S22 is water resistant. I preordered my phone via the Samsung website and since my warranty is still valid, will the repair be free if I mail it to Samsung?	N
Method of backing up files	I plan to do a factory reset of my S22 Ultra because the battery has been really bad even after 3 months of use. How do you usually back up your files? Transferring files to PC take time. I was thinking of buying a USB-C thumb for quicker transfer.	N
Don't buy it direct from Samsung - their invoice practices are incredibly shady	"I received my S22+ the other day direct from Samsung and am trading in my Note 20 Ultra 5G. The trade-in cost was still better than I would have gotten at another store, but I knew I was losing money out by just not selling it aftermarket. Either way, they're charging for things they absolutely **shouldn't** be, and it's amounting to hundreds of dollars extra.
What my order contained: S22+, 45W charger, 15W wireless charger, clear cover. All but the S22+ were picked up with the credit you get for buying the phone, so the phone was the only out-of-pocket part of the order...except it wasn't.
They added all of them into the cost of the order, then included the cost of the 4 months of YouTube Premium and 6 months of OneDrive that you **cannot exclude**, before finally charging tax and then discounting the cost of those things. On top of it, they even included the tax on the $999 of the phone, instead of the $899 it was discounted to.
&amp;#x200B;
So I got charged tax on around $1160 of products when I only bought an $899 phone. I could understand charging shipping for the items they include as credit purchases, but charging tax on all of that is insane...it came out to $80 in tax (which is $18 more than it should have been for the phone). The worst part is I paid $19 for quicker shipping, it was delayed a week, and then when I made a support ticket to get that refunded they said ""Oh you weren't charged for it"".
The best part is that almost nothing on my invoice even matches the receipt. The individual costs do, of course, but the summary of everything is way off. They **almost** match up in the end (the invoice is for $304.99 and the receipt was $312.99), but still...what kind of wonky 1980s-era purchasing system is this?"	N
Battery better than you think.	"So for a while, I've been very invested into this phone and seeing how to save battery. I am using the Snapdragon 8 gen 1 SoC unlocked straight from Samsung. 256 GB storage version.
Here are some of things you can do and may be helpful.
### Sound and vibration ###
Turn off vibrate
### notification ###
more -&gt; Turn off notifications you don't want to see
### Display ###
Turn on Dark mode
Turn off adaptive brightness
Turn off extra brightness
Turn off adaptive screen refresh rate (standard motion smoothness)
Turn off eye comfort shield
Set screen resolution to 1080p
Turn off edge panel
### battery and device care ###
Battery -&gt; background usage limit -&gt; put unused apps to deep sleep
And on the same menu, tap deep sleeping apps and add EVERYTHING you don't use or want notifications from or running in the background.
More battery options -&gt; Turn on all toggles, processing speed is optimized. Protect battery will limit it 85% max charge, but this should keep your battery from dying too fast in terms of battery longevity (low long you can keep charging and discharging before the max capacity degrades over 50%). Keep yout battery out of the heat as well.
### advanced features ###
Turn off bixby routine
Turn off smart suggest
Turn off show contact when sharing
Turn off video call effect
Turn off game launcher
### drop down menu ###
Turn off WiFi when not in use
Turn off network data when not in use
Turn off location when not in use
Turn off Bluetooth when not in use
Turn on extra dim (default not on there)
### developer mode settings ###
Turn off window and transition animator scale
Turn off animation duration scale
The customization of this phone is pretty high. I like how much control I have over it."	N
I'm happy with my phone (regular S22 Exynos)	"Wanted to share my experience in case someone is having second thoughts - people most times post when they're having issues so I shouldn't be lazy and share my love for the phone. So if you are not a heavy user who wants a fast phone with awesome camera, check out below. At the end there's a case recommendation as well.
There was a good deal trough my carrier and time to change contract so I gave up my OP 8T and bought S22. BTW I'm so glad I went for a more compact phone honestly, I love it. 
I'm not here to argue or to say everyone should be happy with this phone and that it's the best one out there for the price, just to share my impressions. Also, I see people here give up S22 for iPhone 13, Pro, Pro Max, but in my country in Europe iPhones are more expensive that Samsung so there was a brief option until I saw the price difference.
My experience  - I'm not a heavy user, I have Switch for portable gaming so I use my phone for social media 10-45 mins a day, watch Youtube videos, browse the internet (gave up Chrome for Samsung Internet actually) listen to podcasts, music on Deezer and Google Maps for like 20mins a day to pick my route to work. Only notifications I have is for messaging apps so not too much apps constantly check for notifications in the background. I charge my phone to 85%, use it all day and still have battery left in the evening every day. I won't go into SOT because different apps drain the battery more or less - reading this sub and the one for my previous phone at the beginning made me paranoid and check SOT too often. I get that people are unsatisfied,  I get why, but I guess for my use case it's just enough. I wanted a better camera, especially video recording for my IG site, love the pics and videos and enjoy using the phone. One downside I noticed is that phone heats up a bit when I record videos for longer periods of time but that's not often. I changed animation time to 0.5 and followed some advice for this sub on settings, turned off adaptive battery, keep it on 120Hz and really enjoy the snappy and awesome experience. Didn't use the Smart Switch thanks to people on this sub who warned about it! Thanks! 
Budget cases I want to recommend alongside are Ringke Onyx- offers decent protection, lip in the middle is lower for gestures and higher in the corners for protection - also, nice texture and grip . One downside for me is that it follows the phones sharp sides so I'm using Spigen Ultra Hybrid Matte, offers grip and protection and looks nice, matte back won't show scratches or fingerprints and yellowing like the clear one and the back feels similar to the back finish of the phone itself. I'm waiting  for DBrand Grip to ship so I can try that one as well, I love the Teardown thing, had it for my OnePlus as well.
My two cents, cheers!"	N
Samsung s22+ vs iPhone 13 Pro	"Hey!  
I bought my s22+ (exynos) in May and my friend bought iPhone 13 Pro in Janurary. And as obvious iPhone was much better.  
S22+ battery lasts around 5-6 hours while scrolling on social media. For gaming around 2 hours.  
iPhone 13 Pro lasts around 13 hours while scrolling on social media. For gaming around 4 hours.  
Gaming experience so far. (Apex Mobile)  
S22+ had 60 fps with medium graphics.   
iPhone 13 Pro had 90 fps with high graphics.  
Normal use experience.  
S22+ had to put most of the apps to deep sleep, every day clear caches.   
(otherwise battery lasts only 4 hours)  
iPhone 13 Pro no need anything above.  
Both devices are for same price in my country, overall I can say as old Samsung fan that iPhone is better. This might change in future and Im not tech person but had change to test out this."	N

Also from 100% -&gt; 90 % it took around 50min before and now only 15-20min

Needed a Larger Screen	"     Current owner of an S21 base SD. Got it new, and has performed flawlessly. Eyes are getting worse, and needed a larger screen. I've tried different screen zooms and such, but couldn't find what I needed. 
Samsung offered me $625 trade-in, to upgrade to a S22 Plus. My out of pocket is $325. Couldn't afford the Ultra. The extra real estate will help. Delivery is supposed to be June 9th
Couldn't go with an A series phone. I'm spoiled with flagship performance

S22 Ultra too heavy- S22 plus better?	"I got an S22 Ultra a couple weeks ago and this is the first Samsung phone I've ever had that's been disappointing and I'll probably return. It seems most have an issue with the size, but I don't see much complaints about the weight/thickness.
The crazy thing about this phone is that it makes my Note 10+ feel like a small sleek phone lol. I don't understand how the phone essentially went backwards in tech over the last 3 years. A bit more features but at the massive cost of thickness and weight, with overheating being a constant issue. 
That being said I'm curious if others feel similar about the S22 plus. It'll be sad to drop some feathers of the ultra but I'd rather enjoy my overall experience."	N

sale at Amazon on s22 phones	I was able to buy a s22+ today with the 256gb for 799 us dollars, compared to 1050 which was the price yesterday. My phone today being a motoz2 meant no one wanted to offer a good trade-in so this was the cheapest way to get up to speed on a new phone.	N
Battery on S22 Pljs is atrocious	I just got the phone so I understand it needs time to understand my habits but all other phones I've owned even in the beginning never had such poor battery life.

S22 horrible experience	"I just bought an s22 exynos (no other options in my country) and had the worst experience with a phone.
It doesent have high and ultra options on pubg mobile,and even on high it runs choppy. Call of duty also runs worse than on my s10 (also exynos). Recording 5 min on 4k 60 fps gets the phone so hot to the point i can barely hold it. I cant belive i paid an obscene amount of money to have a worse experience than i had on my s10.
Antutu scores 800k point on the first run, then 400-600k.
I have had all the galaxyes since s1 and this is by far the worst one.
Naming this phone ""garbage"" is an insult to the word ""garbage"".
Sorry for english mistakes,i'm not native in english.
Edit:just sold the phone. Never again until Samsung offers SD in Europe."	N
Hesitant of changing to s22 ultra	hello all, I‚Äôm thinking of changing to s22 ultra or the iphone 13 series, so far im more attracted to s22 ultra‚Äôs features.But coming from iphone there‚Äôs one thing i‚Äôm afraid of which is the Os updates, S22 Ultra has 4 yrs os update and 5 yrs security however iphone has both of those at 6 yrs at least.

S22 Ultra screen protector?	"Hey all,
I've had my S22 Ultra since release and bought a whitestone dome glass protector, they've been amazing on past phones.. however it seems this one is chipping away glass all over the screen. Looked at reviews and seems others are having the issue.
My question, what is a good screen protector besides whitestone? Even if it's film. Opinions?
How is the Samsung OEM protector they are selling now?

S22 Ultra Case With MagSafe and Kickstand	Does anyone know if a case exists for the S22 Ultra that has both magSafe and a built in kickstand that is flush with the case? I can't seem to find anything online, but it seems like such a simple ask with magSafe cases for Android becoming more common.	N
Has the battery on the S22 Plus improved	I just got my S22 Plus few days ago and while I understand it takes some time to see your habits, it's still ridiculously bad. All other Galaxy phones I've owned even from the beginning stages never had terrible battery so this is genuinely shocking to me. I hope there's an update to fix this because this literally makes no sense. There's even inconsistent frame rate when navigating the phone. Just weird	N
Which should I get? S22 Ultra or iPhone 13 Pro Max?	Can someone suggest to me which is the better one and why? I can't decide on which to get. By now both phones have been released for quite a while so most people can give an honest review about the phone after several months of usage. Thanks in advance!	N
1 month update after factory resetting my s22 ULTRA	"I posted a thread on here about a month ago about how i was sooo done with my S22 ultra. Really low SOT with only 3.5hrs, super laggy/jittery when swiping through apps and casual scrolling through socials. Ultra low benchmark scores. I'm here to say that my 22 ULTRA is now a BEAST!! If you go on antutu and look at the rankings you will see #7 being the s22u, that is my score!! I haven't experienced any lag at all since factory resetting my phone and SOT is now an average of 5hrs! I can even go 10hrs of SOT when power saver is turned on, im currently at 8hrs SOT with 25% remaining. If you're reading this and are having trouble with your flagship as well or any of the other then I strongly suggest a simple factory reset. My theory is that some phones have trouble actually flashing huge quality of life updates onto the device. Hope you find this useful
Edit: Also, failed to mention that although I get 5hrs of SOT when battery saver is turned off. I mainly use my device with the screen off with YouTube/YouTube music, Spotify or any media playing in the background through my buds. So my screen off time is always greater than my SOT but the phone is being used basically all hours of the day except when I'm sleeping."	N

Unlocked s22 ultra with teuls hasn't received any of the 2 updates at all during May what's going on?	"So far to my knowledge there have been two to three major updates that have been released just throughout the month of May for the Samsung s22 ultra one for the camera I believe and then two operating system updates not including the security patch, I have an s22 ultra it's unlocked and it was purchased from the Samsung experience store.
My provider is telus, and I am becoming really aggravated with the lack of updates why have I not received a single one of these three updates primarily the two OS updates that happened in may? We are now in June and I haven't received a single update for the month of May does anyone else have any information particularly other Canadian users?

S22 ultra 8 vs 12 GB ram	"My wife ordered from TELUS the s22 ultra 128gb for me this morning while I was at work. I chose the 128gb model because I won't be storing much videos on it and I don't use too many apps.
I didn't know the 128gb model comes with 8gb of ram instead of 12.
Would I notice a difference from the 12gb ram models? I won't be doing any extremely heavy use but I want to make sure it's just as snappy as the models with 12gb ram.
It's too late to cancel my order now but I could always return it as t a physical store before I open the box."	N

I **bleep** up, and yet......	I purchased two S22Ultras, each about a week apart, to take advantage of the trade-in offer from Samsung. Outside of waiting for the bride's phone to ship, no problem.HOWEVER, when returning her S21U for her trade-in, I mistakenly printed off the shipping label for my phone. Once I realized my mistake, I confirmed that the phone had, in fact, been received by Samsung.I then contacted Samsung to inform them of my mistake. They confirmed the order number. I gave them the tracking number. They escalated the search, since they could confirm the phone made it to them. In 48 hours, they resolved the issue and I avoided a charge-back.Excellent work, Sammy.

No **bleep** eSIM Support with any major carriers	I am getting tired of contacting every carrier for them to tell me only eSIM support is available on the iPhone. eSIM is nothing new and I cant understand why there is no support for the Samsung Phones. I am tired of carrying around 2 phones for business and personal and what is the purpose of having dual sim phones if no carrier supports the eSIM? Why does the international S22's have 2 physical sim slots while we are stuck with one Physical Slot and one eSIM of which I cant find any carrier who supports it?I have tried Verizon, Visible, US Mobile, T-Mobile and all say the same thing... No sorry support might be coming soon but if you have an iPhone we can activate it. I have had Samsung phones for over 10 years and I think I am about done with them.	N

They've rendered my phone all but useless. Thanks N2myN2	N

I LOVE THIS PHONE	"I recently switched over from an iPhone 13 to an S22 Ultra and I can't tell you how much I've missed Samsung.
Camera and hardware: what a major upgrade, seriously. The tools it offers makes me feels ready for any situation, anywhere. Kids pics come out crystal clear, with the ability get creative while editing. Screen is so freaking vivid and colorful. The feel of the phone is what I like to show off now in front of my bros when I see them on their iphone s. I can now brag about what they don't have in hardware. DONT GET ME STARTED ON THAT S PEN!
Battery: I honestly don't see what the big deal is on battery life not lasting all day. I did notice the battery consumption rate on this device clearly different from my previous iPhone, but I understand the type of device I work with and honestly don't mind the difference. I still manage to get through the day with a single charge. That's coming from a service tech in the field. *Also love the whole battery and memory management on device care.
Software and more: can get tricky customizing everything at first, but definitely get the hang of it after the second week. That's what makes this phone and software beautiful. Being able to control what you want, where you want it and what not. Refresh rate is pretty cool at 120. Being able to control rate is even cooler 
I use this phone almost as a portable laptop on the go. Screen is big enough for documents and signature capture with pen, and as well as an entertainment device when playing Roblox or watching videos. I don't mind ditching the SD card really, but that's because I use Dropbox alot for synching documents at work. 
I know I left out so many features here, but man I'd type a whole damn story about it if I could. 
Overall I seriously appreciate this device and getting me through the day and night. I think that's what's missing in this sub."	N

(Request + Observations) Spigen Cryo Case Efficiency?	"Has anyone taken the time to test the thermal conduction of the Spigen Cryo case?
I noticed that my phone became quite warm while in use (camera use included) in my TPU hard case. I also recently bought a charger that supports Super Fast Charging 2.0 that I intend to make use of and was concerned about hotboxing the phone while charging it. 
I finally have the case in my hands, and do notice that it feels warm but not as hot (on the outermost material). If I can trust the app I have installed, battery temperature seems to rest around 28¬∞ C, rises to about 35-38¬∞ while super fast charging (2.0), and stays around 32¬∞ C during light-med use like, say, writing this post with Youtube video in the background. (CPU temp 33~37¬∞ with spikes, Optimized Processing mode, 120hz, 1440p).
I have not tested how it holds up during benchmarks if that concerns you (de-throttlegate), but I did *think* I saw slightly higher scores in some such AnTuTu.

Video recording not working	Hello my fellow s22U users. Ive had this phone since early May. Im currently on the most recent firmware and May security update. Has anyone had any issues with your camera not recording video? Like it would proceed to "capture" video but the timer stays the same. It doesnt even turn red and counting. Wondering if the June update fixed this? Please get back to me. Thanks! Its kinda my current deal breaker because i did clear cache and clear data nothing, reboot sometimes fixes it sometimes it doesn't. And the unpredictability is very unsettling because i have tried incorporating a daily reboot even twice a day to avoid this but damn i missed some key moments with my kids bec the thing wont work. Im almost close to selling this and getting the 13 pro max instead. Im willing to sacrifice all the awesome things that the sammy has for better reliability.	N

Giving away some cases and a screen protector	"Hello everyone.
Tldr: Returning my phone and I'm giving away two cases and one screen protector.
Sadly, I've decided to return my beautiful S22U because I can't get past  the standby drain, the random lag and mediocre battery life. 
I've used the phone for 25 days and it didn't get any better battery wise in this time. I did 2 factory reset and optimized the apps every week but the battery life is just terrible. I had to recharge in the afternoon with only 1h of screen on time.

does 1080p on a 1440p panel look any better then 1080p on a 1080p panel?	For this I am just talking strictly how the image looks when it comes to pixels and maybe even the visably of pixels. I know that a 1440p screen will cost more and is more likely to have better cosmetics, but I am just talking strictly about qaulity. The reason I have this question is because am going to be getting a s22+ here soon which is a 1080p panel and I was testing 1440p vs 1080p settings on a note 9 and really was not able to spot any differences even though I have very good vision and was really expecting to be able to. I was also testing YouTube videos with 1440p resolutions and 1080p resolutions with both regular videos and also dolby Atmos made videos which are made to show very great detail. I am also wondering about the difference in being able to look closely and see pixels because as I am typing this on a 720p screen I can very easily look close and see pixels. Now I'm not sure if the fact that it was a 1440p screen was helping with the perceived qaulity or not so if anyone knows anything at all please let me know! Thank yaaa	N

Do You really like photos quality in S22 Ultra?	"Hi,
I see a lot of people who are delighted with the pictures from the S22 Ultra, I must admit that I am surprised. Have Samsung users never had other phones than Samsung in their hands? Personally, I returned the S22 Ultra due to the hopeless quality of the photos - only 10x is worth something, all the rest is a really poor level, especially when You view on 32 inch monitor.
Huawei P40 PRO took photos a few classes higher, it had a brilliant 50 MPIX Ai mode giving great quality 20 megapixel photos. Also Lumia 950 XL from 2015 (!!!) takes much better photos.

Video recorder not working?	Hello my fellow s22U users. Ive had this phone since early May. Im currently on the most recent firmware and May security update. Has anyone had any issues with your camera not recording video? Like it would proceed to "capture" video but the timer stays the same. It doesnt even turn red and counting. Wondering if the June update fixed this? Please get back to me. Thanks! Its kinda my current deal breaker because i did clear cache and clear data nothing, reboot sometimes fixes it sometimes it doesn't. And the unpredictability is very unsettling because i have tried incorporating a daily reboot even twice a day to avoid this but damn i missed some key moments with my kids bec the thing wont work. Im almost close to selling this and getting the 13 pro max instead. Im willing to sacrifice all the awesome things that the sammy has for better reliability.	N

Connecting Galaxy Buds 2 to Macbook Pro AND S22+ - Buds won't enter pairing mode.	"so i have a Samsung Galaxy s22+ as my personal phone, and use my Galaxy Buds 2 with them. for work, i use a Macbook Pro. when working from home, i just let audio play thru my speakers and use the mic on my webcam for calls, but since they are making us return to the office 2x weekly, teams calls have become an issue. i am currently using the wired headphones which came with my Galaxy s10+ (or s8, it's been so long) which sound good and have a nice enough mic, but the cable is too short. i spend my whole meeting leaned forward so they can reach my Macbook in its dock. 
i've been trying tor remedy this by pairing the Buds to my macbook pro for those calls, and then disconnecting and going back to my Galaxy to listen to music during work, but i can't seem to get my buds to enter pairing mode. i return them to their case, close it for 6 seconds, then take them out and put them in my ear. i then hold the touch pad for 10+ seconds (i held for a full minute with no luck) and nothing will get them to enter pairing mode. i've turned off bluetooth on my phone, i've turned my phone off, the one thing i don't want to do is totally reset the buds and have their primary pairing device be my Macbook.
has anyone here had success pairing your buds to two devices and switching between them? does anyone else have issues getting their buds to enter pairing mode at all?"	N

help with trading in galaxy s22 with promo credits for iphone13	3 months ago I received a galaxy s22 from AT&amp;t with promotional credits that make the phone free for me. I'm no longer satisfied with Google operating system and so I want to trade it in for an iPhone 13. AT&amp;t tells me however that because the phone is not paid in full I would have to pay the remaining balance of the phone and then I could use that to trade in for an iPhone 13. But I'm essentially getting the Galaxy for free due to the promotional credits. so I tried to make the case to AT&amp;t that I'd just be turning in a phone that I'm not paying for--that at&amp;t is essentially paying for-- which they could then refurbish and resell to make money on it, and use that phone as my qualifier for an iPhone 13 promotion. But they're not buying it. They also suggested I could add a line but I really don't want to increase the expense on my account at all. Does anyone have any suggestions for how I could go about doing this?	N

Set Guardian option unavailable on Find my Mobile	I have "Find my Mobile" activated on my S22 Ultra (ATT provider). When I log into Samsung Account and go to Find my Mobile (on both a PC brower and mobile device) it works fine, I can see the location of my phone, lock it, turn it off, make it ring etc...all works fine. BUT, the option to "Set Guardian" is not available to click on. I checked my wifes S22 Ultra as well, exact same thing, and she is on a completely different Samsung account....anyone have any insight here? Help would be hugely appreciated. I have updated "find my mobile", I have updated android, I have logged out of samsung account and back in multiple times, used different browsers, deactivated "find my mobile" and re-activated, and restarted phone, all same results. Crazy thing is that YESTERDAY the options was there, and now it is not and I need to add a guardian.I have also spoke with Samsung Care Pro, they did not know why so gave me an 800 number for phone support.

Best method transferring data from iPhone to Samsung S22	"Obviously, going from Android to Android or iOS to iOS is (typically) a simple transfer process. However, when going from one to the other can be a bit of a challenge. I am picking up a S22 Ultra later today and just curious what do you prefer when transferring data from iOS to Android or vise versa?  
I've had both positive and negative experiences in the past when going from one operating system to another. I have also read, that it is better to set it up as a new phone as certain items may or may not transfer over smoothly.  
More than likely, I will set the Ultra up as a new, but it would be interesting to see other people's input and experiences."	N

Last night I set this one at 8K and decided to stop at one minute, so that's why the question, is it capped at a certain time / length, or will it theoretically keep recording until it runs out of space?
Like I said, 8K recording on a cell phone to **me** is more of a gimmick and something I doubt I'll use except to play with, but curious what it's time / storage limit is?"	N

S22 Ultra impressions compared to iPhone 13 Pro Max.	"I bought both phones on release and this question gets asked a lot on reddit on which one to buy so I'll share some comparisons since I use both phones regularly.
I enjoy both phones, they offer a different UI experience but there are plenty of areas it's easy to compare so it's not totally Apples to Oranges in every aspect.
&amp;#x200B;
**Things I like about the S22U**
&amp;#x200B;
**Display -**
I love the look of the display the small hole punch for the camera allows the screen to fill up the dead space. The screen is decent, it's nothing we've not seen before, OLED panels have been around for a long time so, like all OLED displays, it looks great, the screen has a good minimal brightness for a dark room viewing. Do note there's some dark level smearing at lower brightness but this isn't inherent to the S22U it's an issue with these OLED panels in general and is easily fixed with brightness adjustment. Non third-party content feels smooth, 120hz is always welcome, not as smooth as Pro Motion displays but damn good.
**Dex -**
making transferring files a breeze, an awesome feature, and a true modern pro phone that can almost become a portable computer.
**Multitasking -**
Being able to multitask on the device is also great, why IOS hasn't implemented that yet is beyond me but it's also most likely a business decision by Apple to sell more macs if you want that feature, damn you Apple.
**Battery life -**
I've seen a lot of complaints about battery, 99% of these complaints are ridiculous. I've seen people post screenshots of their 20hr with 5hr SOT and saying how bad this is. Really? this is a high resolution, nearly 7"" display, that's a crap ton of pixels to push, at 120hz mixed with that fact android is open source and lacks refinement with a lot of processing and power under the hood I'd say that if you're getting 4-5hrs over a day, you're fine. I get about 5-6 hours over 24 hours. If I used the phone from 100% to dead, I'd prob get easily 7-8 hours depending on the content it really does vary.
&amp;#x200B;
**Things I don't like**
&amp;#x200B;
**Colour handling -** Samsung devices are terrible for their colour tunings. This phone has a wide colour gamut, I've heard reports up to 99% D65-P3, I'm not sure how accurate this is but the display looks as wide as my computer monitor for gamut which measures close to 98% so I would not be surprised. There's some heavy extension in the blue and greens so seems to maybe a bit further into aRGB. The S22U ships with this gamut by default, why?! no content on this phone supports D65-P3 so you're left with heavy oversaturation, horribly so.
You can enable ""Natural mode"" which clamps the gamut closer to sRGB but if you want to watch HDR content, you have to manually switch to Vivid mode. IOS for example, auto switches depending on your content, Apple has done this for years.
The Gamma is also wack, we get black crush, you lose shadow detail, this is a tuning preference for Samsung, they have don this is almost all their devices, they believe most people enjoy overly sharp and overly poppy, I get that the masses will appeal to this but at least give some of us the option to turn all this boosted nonsense off.
&amp;#x200B;
**Camera -**
Camera is overall good, but hear me out this isn't an issue with the camera per say it's once again, Samsungs choice to overly shared the image and crush blacks, this is also evident when viewing photos on my computer. This is Samsungs choice for an overly contrasty look, mirroring their tuning preference. Raw mode yields much better results of course. I'm sure the masses will be happy with the pictures and they do look pleasing, out-of-the-box though I am just not keen on Samsungs tunings preferences.
&amp;#x200B;
**Speakers -** I understand that it's a phone and speakers aren't it's forte but Samsung are taking the micky here. Tinny, thin, use headphones., not much else to say.
&amp;#x200B;
**Build -**
Beautiful but fragile. These phones will dent and scratch easy, get a good case. I recommend the Torro Leather case, the screen will be protected and it can take bumps and drops. The official cases are awful, the Leather one is made from thin cheap leather and while it feels nice, it will scratch with dust. Also if you drop this phone outside with the leather case, it's game over.
I also hate the shape, it is not a phone to hold comfortably in my opinion, it's pointy, hard to grip slippery, and again get a good case.
&amp;#x200B;
**UI -**
Samsungs UI is buggy, rough, and unrefined. This isn't new, I own many Samsung products and their software is complete rubbish in my opinion. The Phone can feel jittery, micro stutters, I've actually seen this on multiple units and was easily noticeable for me. It looks nice, better than previous abominations but still, Samsung has a way to go before their software feels good to use in my opinion.
&amp;#x200B;
**Compared to iPhone 13 Pro Max**
&amp;#x200B;
**UI -**
When it comes to UI, it really is as simple as do you want choice or do you want smooth and refined. IOS feels better than ever on the Pro Max, Apps are way better optimized, it's always been like this, it's like most commercial apps are made with Apple in mind and everything else is secondary. IOS is smoother, faster, and nicer to use. Being more locked down and controlled means there are better tolerances. This is party why the battery is so good on the iPhone it's far more refined and apps need to meet Apple's standards. Apps also look and perform better on the iPhone, no contest, social media apps are more comfortable to use. 
Apollo for Reddit is also in my opinion, nicer to use than Sync and Infinity which are in my opinion, the two best Reddit apps. Apollo is smoother and faster but I'd say Infinity is slightly better looking but Infinity is too cramped. 
&amp;#x200B;
**Screen -**
Apples use of this Pro Motion Samsung displays is better implemented, it feels smoother, again. It has better colour handling, the sRGB tuning is perfect, no Gamma issues, you can see shadow detail with no crushing, a beautiful example of how a well-tuned OLED could and should look, the fact that the Phone auto switches from sRGB to P3 is seamless and brilliant. Default settings the Samsung is heavily oversaturated, it will look more vibrant and will seem like it pops more, but that's because the phone ships in it's native colour gamut, if the iPhone did the same thing, it would look as vibrant but Apple has accuracy in mind and I am grateful. It's important that people should see how their content truly looks, and give people the option to have the right Gamma values and the correct colour space.
Auto white balance on the iPhone is also a godsend
&amp;#x200B;
**Battery life -**
The more refind IOS allows the iPhone to just drained at a more steady rate, I'd say in my usage, the iPhone last at least 20% longer in normal usage, sometimes more, depending on the content used. It is able to hold up overnight dropping only 1-4% depending on background usage whereas the S22U drops between 5-10%, usually at the higher end. 
&amp;#x200B;
**Camera -**
In the default state, the Max takes the more natural-looking images, the Samsung looks too heavily processed in the wrong direction, and it can look grainy. The S22U has a way superior zoom and Macro mode. This comes down to tuning vs versatility, just like the UI experience. Both cameras are great, I personally wouldn't make my decision on which phone over the camera.
&amp;#x200B;
When choosing between these two it comes  down to the user you are. techies will prefer the freedom of the S22U while those looking for build, longevity and user friendly-ness will most likely want the iPhone. Both are great at what they can do but I feel for Samsung to be a total package, they need to provide Pro users/enthusiasts with better calibration and Apple needs to implement better Multitasking capabilities. With Samsung, if I take a photo,  I want to see how it looks truly, not deal with crushing for a more pleasing image and that's where the iPhone is a better experience."	N

Love The Samsung Gray Leather Case!	"I haven't been a big fan of Samsung's leather cases from previous years, but I have to say they absolutely nailed it with this year's gray model. 
Not much in terms of side lips, but the top and bottom lips are sufficient. I thought the case would be a bit too slippery, but after a day of use, it has developed a nice grippy feel.
https://i.imgur.com/kb6DM4Y.jpg

Backing up before heading to cellular store to exchange. Which is best method?	"I used Smart Switch when I transferred from my S20 Ultra to my new S22 Ultra on 6/2, but in the last week I can see I will outgrow the capacity of this 256GB phone so I've got an appointment in a couple of days with my cell carrier to exchange for a larger model, while I still can under the 30 day return policy.
My question is, should I ask them to let me use Smart Switch between my existing and new, bigger model while I'm at the cell carrier store, or is there a local or cloud backup solution I can use ahead of my appointment (while still at home) that will include every bit of info? A lot of the threads I see in this subreddit about backup say that Smart Switch restores more items than Google cloud backup, for example. I used to have a full backup app years ago for a rooted Android phone I had, but I am not looking to root this device (if it's even possible), so I want to be sure I am using the most comprehensive solution possible.
If using a local/cloud backup, I would just wait to get home from the store, sign in to Google and then restore from whatever source is advised. Unless someone has a recommendation otherwise...?"	N

my experience with my s22 + (Snapdragon)	"So I bought a s22+ a couple of weeks ago and I want to share my experience with you.
I used to have a xiaomi mi 6 which was a good phone, but it hasn't updated since 2020 and I also needed more memory. I decided to go for Samsung since they promised 4 years of updates (I'm not the kind of person who changes his phone every year) and in my country is WAY cheaper than iPhone, which gives longer software support. I was about to pick the a53 but its cpu didn't convince me (exynos 1280) so I decided to pick a s22+ knowing that it will age better. 
So I got my new s22 +, I was amazed in the beginning of how fast the phone was, its screen is much brighter than needed but it's fine. It had a little bit of stuttering and the main problem was battery. Yes, battery used to go down very quickly and it didn't last much more than a day. So the first days were kind of a disappointment, I was expecting much more of the premium series of Samsung, and I have to add that its charger is not as fast as expected. 
After a week, battery started to last longer,  I don't remember the name very well but I think it is adaptative battery, that feature learns what apps you use and optimizes the usage of the phone so it doesn't need to waste energy on apps that you do not use frequently. The thing is that the phone started to last longer and I felt the need of sharing this, from roughly a day of usage with full battery I went to almost 2 days (a little bit of gaming included) which is amazing. I also followed the advice of the next video, something that was a good plus. 
https://youtu.be/1LGQtd3qqvk
I just wanted to share with you my experience. Whenever I buy something I like to read other user's opinions so I can get the best from my money. I hope this helps you if you are looking to buy this phone or maybe if you are just comparing it with another one. 
Have a good day!"	N
Question about battery life...	"So I got my S22+ last night, and I've been using it throughout my work day, but I was curious how much better the battery is from my old S10+, so I go into device care to look at how much longer I have on my battery life...and it says 9 hours left (its at 68%) 
Those numbers can't be right can they? I thought/heard the battery on this phone is good?"	N
Has Anyone Tried These Cases?	"I'm a big fan of leather cases, and just happened to stumble across this store. Has anyone tried these? Because they look absolutely incredible. I have the Samsung Gray leather case on my S22U currently, but I'm a case nerd and always will pick up new ones I like.
Let me know if you have tried these before, thanks! :)

Temperatures on S22 Exynos	"Hey guys, I just wanted to share with you temperatures that my Samsung achieved in certain apps.
Texting apps:
Discord: 32-34
Messenger: 31-33
Whatsapp: 31-33
Browsing:
Chrome: around 34
Chrome + notes as floating window: 36
Social:
Reddit: 35-36(just scrolling the home page)
While writing this post I had 35
Instagram: 35 avg
YouTube: 36(It's quite hot considering I was just watching 1080p video. I could feel the phone was warm) 
Apps using camera:
Samsung Camera( here I took 5 pictures in night mode and 8 second video FHD 30. Worth to mention that the camera was quite stuttery): peak temp was 41.
Snapchat( did the same things as with the default camera) 41
3D Mark(made the test separately from everything  when phone was at 29celcius):
Wild Life Extreme: 32-39 (1Loop: 2100 points, 2Loop 1850points, 3Loop 1750 points. A lot of throttling)
And last for comparison I got around 36-37 with Geometry Dash in a high object count level. 
For all of this I was using Cpu monitor app. 
I used each app for around 8minutes. 
I guess this phone has a big problem with image and video rendering. In texting apps where the content was mainly text the temperatures where pretty low. Where as the apps with videos and images got me high temps. 
It is actually impossible to use phone without any sort of heat. In the afternoon I usually check all of my notification. I will always end up with the phone being warm no matter if I checked 2 apps or oppened 6. 
During the tests I was always on Wi-Fi. The phone heats up much more when using mobile data(4G)
Also I can put here my avg memory use which was around 70% or more in all apps. 
My S22 is one day after a factory reset, without using any Smart Switch and other backup apps. I also wiped cache using recovery mode. (Android 12 June Update)
What is your experience with heating? Do you think 41 celcius for camera app is something to worry about? Do you have any tips to prevent heating? Is it possible for Samsung to optimise their software? What about temperatures on SD variants?"	N
Charging from flat - s22 Ultra	"Evening all,   
I have a UK spec s22 Ultra, had it since release date.   
Firstly - battery life, taking it off charge at around 7am, it generally runs out around 7pm.   
Apps being used - Whatsapp, Teams, Outlook, Facebook, TikTok, Spotify and browser.   
Should it drain this quick?  
Also once it has completely ran flat, If I put it on charge, it takes a god dam age to get to 1% . At the moment it has been on charge for around 45 minutes, and I am still unable to turn it on. Using a samsung 15 w charger."	N
What's a good Bluetooth controller for each of the different S22 phones?	"Razer Kishi? 
Xbox One controller with mount?
Is there a different one that's so good that you need to let all of us know? Im ready to look into one and possibly buy one but I wanna know what you think. I have the S22 Plus. I bet S22 and S22 Ultra Owners also want their input."	N
Anyone go from a Fold 3 to the S22 Ultra?	"Hi! The narrow front screen drives me nuts and I don't like texting on the big inner screen. I am thinking of trading in for the S22 Ultra while they are offering $1,000 for the Fold 2, leaving $166 for the S22! I want the built in silo. I miss my Note 10+.

Brand new S22 has died on me	"I've had the S22 for exactly 5 days. 
On the first night there was an issue where I was experimenting with the different camera modes and doing some very quick videos when suddenly the phone powered off with no warning. After rebooting I got a warning message nearly immediately saying that the phone is overheating and will power off if it gets any hotter. I quickly put it back down and stopped playing with it because I did notice it felt quite warm. Slightly befuddled, but whatever.
And then today the whole issue with the camera happened again. I was making a short video with the front camera and then the phone just turned off after about 3 seconds of recording. When I turned it back on again, I tried making the exact same video (front camera, &gt;3 seconds) and sure enough it turned off again. Only this time it won't turn back on! I've tried different guides on how to reboot it, with different combination of volume key + side button and plugging it in, but to no avail.
Thankfully it is still under warranty (it's only been 5 days!!) but I am extremely disappointed. From what I've googled it seems like this is a common issue... among many other issues. I can't believe this is a flagship phone."	N
S22 Ultra screen protector spontaneously cracking after 5 days	"Got my Samsung S22 Ultra this Saturday that went by. Instantly got a glass screen protector for it. It's only been 5 days, and I already have two cracks on the edges of the glass protector.

Thank you, samsung care+	My screen had this permanent smudge on it. Called Samsung and they directed me to this company call ubreakifix. When I went there the guy said they would email samsung to see it is covered under warranty to replace the screen and will let me know 2 days later.2 days later I called and they guy said samsung won't cover it but they can replace the screen for $320.

I really need help finding an unlocked international model for S22 Ultra	"I've been going bananas and nuts trying to gather information on the S22 Ultra international models. 
I'm certain, with Verizon, I need a GSM & CDMA capable phone so my voice and data both work. 
I'm fairly certain I can't use one of the Exynos chipped models, but that it has to be a Snapdragon chip. (conflicting information out there on this) 
So I'm thinking I need the SM-S908E ... or the B? 
Barring that, for anyone who has gotten an unlocked US model, can you get the Developer Options to appear and if so, does OEM Unlock appear?  None of the demo models at Best Buy would unlock Developer Options, but that may just be a demo restriction. 
Bottom line, I want to root the next phone so I can install Titanium Backup and get the excess garbage under control.  My Verizon bloated S20 Ultra literally has no way to get to OEM Unlock.  It simply isn't there."	N

Im very excited to get my new device, but after looking at the phone at my local ATT I know it is much thicker than the Note 10 Plus.

S22 vs P30 vs Pixel 6 main camera comparison - Link to photos	"After my post yesterday of being disappointed with the S22's camera quality (thanks everybody who provided tips and insightful comments!), I took some more photos with all three phones and thought I'd share them with you, in case you are interested:
[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b6W1bKXolTU1lOHTFqZUFa97UEq2Z4Fs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b6W1bKXolTU1lOHTFqZUFa97UEq2Z4Fs?usp=sharing)
All photos are unedited and uncompressed, just straight out of the phones. You will notice that the Pixel joined the fray a bit later, so not many samples of it for the first half. Draw your own conclusions.
If you care about mine, the Pixel 6's main camera is probably the best I've seen in a phone so far. It also has the biggest sensor, which definitely helps a lot gathering more light. The S22 and P30, despite being 3 years apart, provide quite similar results in terms of detail. I personally pay more attention to that, since contrast and colours can be easily edited, but detail either is there or it isn't. This is all for photos; video in the S22 is better than in the P30.
Also this is not a comment on the all around phone quality. I think the S22 is a great phone in general, amazing feeling, size, figerprint sensor (leagues better than the Pixel 6's), etc. It's just that the camera is mediocre for a top of the line phone in 2022 when compared with the likes of the Pixel 6's, and it's particularly painful because of how much I like the rest of the phone.
Hope you find the comparison interesting."	N
S22 Ultra 1TB worth it?	"Looking to upgrade wife's phone.  Presently has a Note 8 and one of its benefits was having an SD card.
She normally keeps a phone for about 5 years and most of the storage is from taking photos.

A MagSafe charger in the car and magnetic bases for my Pop Sockets and rings have been the best answer to my dilemma.

Bought some apple wired earphones and a type c to headphone jack adapter and the volume is very low compared to my previous phone the s10 with the same headphones.

The specs of the S22 say it's only 7.6mm, but the ones I have seen briefly in person looked thicker and when I check out [this video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyKYk8Ww9Sw) I looks like it's actually quite a bit thicker than the S10e, even without the camera bump.

S22 Ultra - A few months on, I'd like to hear your thoughts on the cases and screen protectors you bought. Gimme the good, the bad and the ugly.	"So now that the phones been out for a little while, I wanted to hear from people about the cases and screen protectors they bought and how they've held up over a longer period of time. I really don't know if I can trust any youtubers anymore, I dont follow any of the tech ones closely enough to know whether they are honest or just going off sponsorships. 
Which case and protector did you get? Did it hold up? Do you like it? Is there something annoying about it? Would love your feedback, thanks."	N
S22 Ultra performing worse than a three year old OnePlus?	"Is anyone else seriously underwhelmed at how poor the S22 Ultra performs? It is SO laggy and slow when switching between apps, and will sometimes just close the app down when it freezes. Not doing anything crazy with it, usual social media apps, which I close down fairly often too.
The phone has 8GB of RAM (which I'm using) and the phone is worth over a grand? I had the OnePlus 7 Pro which is still lightning fast and never had a single issue with it lagging or being slow when switching between apps. 
Also very underwhelmed with the camera. It's fine, but that's all it is, fine. For the price, I'd be expecting a hell of a lot more than fine. 10x zoom is pretty crisp tbf though.
I've heard it's just this model, because of the new chip in the new shape and body, but I kinda can't believe people aren't kicking off over it. Unless my phone is faulty but I've had it barely a month and used like half of my storage.
Anyone else having similar issues?"	N

S22 Ultra 1TB Back Order	I started an insurance claim through asurion to get a replacement. Im in alaska and in the military, so i cannot go a long time without my phone.

Data Switching between sims	Hi, I have s22 ultra that I bought directly from Samsung. I have one physical sim and one esim. This the problem; Lets say I am sending or receiving a message with any media in it, the phone won't allow it unless I manually go into the settings and switch over to use that sim as the primary. Now that I have switched over to that sim it won't allow any media message on the other sim until I go back in again. I can't seem to find any info on this. I have seem some vids where there is an option in sim management for auto data witching. I don't have that option at all for some reason. TBH I am not even sure if that would fix it but I can't eve try. Any ideas? I really don't want to go back to using two phones. TIA.	N
Can I add Spotify to lock screen	Hi, I have been trying to add spotify to my lock screen, as I did this with previous phones but i am unable to get this to happen.Has anyone added it to the lock screen?

buying a second s-pen is a waste of money	"i got a second s-pen and it turns out according to Samsung support, only one s-pen can use the air command (like taking a picture, moving forward/backward in the gallery, unlocking the phone...etc) at a time. 
in other words, i have s-pen1 in the slot which is pair/connected to the phone, and s-pen2 which i can do everything except BT functions (air command). and if i need to use the air commands, i have to swap s-pen2 with s-pen1. what a pain is that? 
then this so-called samsung support implies UI5.0 will fix this issue which enables both s-pen to work, yet he was not able to show me the change log to support. 
anyone with a second s-pen shares the same frustrations?"	N

[BUG] S Pen AirCommand app setting two alarms seen in upcoming alarms.	On my new Galaxy S22 Ultra in Android 12, I'm seeing two alarms that are being set by the S Pen's AirCommand app.The alarms can be seen in the KWGT Widget app when you set a widget to show upcoming alarms. This prevents the proper display of user set alarms, since the two S Pen alarms usually appear first.One alarm appears in upcoming alarms when the phone is in wake or sleep mode, and sets itself about 9 hours ahead of the current time. The other alarm appears when the phone is in charge mode, and sets itself 10 minutes ahead of the current time.I confirmed the alarms are being set by the AirCommand app by uninstalling the AirCommand app with package name com.samsung.android.service.aircommand. When that package was uninstalled, both alarms completely disappeared, and when it was re-installed the alarms re-appeared.I never had this issue on my Note 20 Ultra in Android 11, so some new change must of occured for this to appear on the S22U in Android 12.Can this message be forwared to the developement team to see if some other method can be used so upcoming alarms in the KWGT widget will not see alarms set by the AirCommand app?

Experiencing worse video quality than S10	"Hi, I bought the Galaxy S22 Ultra (Snapdragon) yesterday, I used the S10 for 3 years and exchanged that one with this.
Since yesterday, I feel the video quality of the S22 is not as good as the S10. I find the video to be less sharp and probably not well-focused. The sharpness of elements in the video is bad as compared to S10, I've had a great amount of time shooting videos with S10 because it had that level of quality and so I can easily feel the difference.
Not sure if it's just me or if it's some setting I need to change. Or if it's because of something like Snapdragon vs Exynos (my S10 was the Exynos variant). I feel bad about paying so much for this and getting this result.

Network reception issues	"Does anyone else have reception issues on their S22 Ultra Exynos?
I have lots of problems with 4G connections and also Wifi reception is very weak.
It seems the phone has a lot of problems to switch between antennas so when on the move many times it just looses connection and takes ages to reconnect.
Also in places where there is weak signal, although with other phones it's possible to get internet connection, S22 ultra simply wont connect or say it has 4G but no app can communicate, infuriating when you need to check something really quick on the web or some app.
&amp;#x200B;
Wifi reception is also pretty bad. In my house i used wifi in all division without problems with all my previous phones, with S22 Ultra it's either half the speed of my previous phone (p20 Pro) or Wifi goes up and down in some rooms which makes it difficult to use.
&amp;#x200B;
This is frustrating as i use a P20 Pro  and have none of this issues i even had to use P20 as Wifi Router for S22 Ultra in some places i go to.

Anyone able to figure out what is in the ""other"" category, and does it contain anything that can be removed? Anyway for me to access the info further? Normally I wouldn't think too much of it and just assume it's extra Samsung software being that I've barely used the phone, but nearly 27GB on top of 32 for system seems excessive, particularly when considering that they stripped the phones of expandable memory and we have to be a bit more conservative with our space now. 
Thanks in advance!"	N

Wallpaper app that makes my wallpaper scrollable	When I say scrollable, I mean when I'm on the home page if I swipe left or right the wall paper also moves slightly to the left or to the right because in reality the wallpaper is wider than the phone screen. Does anyone know any app that does this? I currently am using my s10e and I use to have an app that let me do this, but one day it disappeared and I haven't been able to find an equivalent app. I have a wallpaper I like to use for this and my S22 Ultra is on the way and I'd like to have this feature on my new phone. Anyone know an app that lets me do this?	N

Tips for Quick Phone Swaps - Incremental Backup w Smart Switch? Other?	"Tomorrow I'm swapping my S22 Ultra (camera failing, under warranty of course) and while I like that TMO is getting me another quickly, I have to pickup the new one and turn in the old at the same time.  Since SmartSwitch takes a while, any tips on speeding this up?
I offloaded all my backed up media (had 300gigs of video as I vlog), so that helps, but the backup in Smart Switch last night still took a long time.  I'll want a ""fresh"" backup tomorrow, but I don't see an incremental backup update, and can't run another for 4 hours in the store.  Am I missing something?  Any tricks?"	N
Verizon S22 Ultra updates downloading over cellular - can't restrict to wifi only	I'm on 1 bar of 4g in the office today, and I notice that there's a software update downloading. I contacted Verizon via Twitter and had to argue with them that there is no "developer options" in my settings. They're now telling me to toggle the "install security updates automatically" to off and this will force it to ask me before even downloading. I don't believe them - I think I had it toggled off a couple of months ago and it downloaded but didn't install. If that setting restricted downloads, it would be downloading at 2-4 am as I selected, not 12 pm.	N
the zoom isnt as good as the s21	"I had to trade in my European s21 plus for the s22 plus as my s21 wasn't working on american sim carda even though it was unlocked ( samsung proudly go f yourself for this as ive never had this problem with apple) .
The zoom isnt as good as the larger megapixel camera on the s21, this one on the s22 has better focus it really does portrait shots better but if we are talking zoom wise  the lack of detail shows so much, it cant even be used to zoom anymore."	N

Welp, I'm not sure what did it, but my battery seems to have stabilized after a MONTH of fiddling	"S22U SD Verizon
I reset all settings, that didn't help
I factory reset and set up from scratch, that didn't help
Last night I contacted Samsung support who offered to send me to a local repair center
As a last ditch effort, after speaking with Samsung, I downloaded Accubattery from the Play Store and saw that Samsung Internet was banging on my battery so I put it into deep sleep
I can't say for sure if Samsung Internet was the culprit, but I'd also downloaded and ""enabled"" the Disconnect privacy add-in for Samsung Internet, but apparently never finished setting up the add-in (Disconnect has an app that installs alongside the add-in). All signs point to either Samsung Internet being an asshole or my inability to follow through on setting up my add-in. 
Like most of you in the struggle, I've also disabled carrier bloat (no ADB) and put everything else I don't really need into deep sleep... The only thing I never wanted to sacrifice was the 120Hz refresh rate. It was the whole reason I got this phone...
Anyway, hope this helps somebody. And Samsung, you're a dick. It really seems like this can be fixed with a software update.

New S22 user battery life experience	"Having read this subreddit a lot, I was on the fence about getting one of the latest Galaxy phones with all the reports of bad battery life, but I felt like there was enough info and tips on here to get a ""normal"" experience out of the phones, so I decided to take the plunge and thought it'd be worth sharing my own experience to far for anyone else who is thinking about getting the phone but is being put off by all of the reports of bad battery life.
I received my base S22 a few days ago, and the first thing I did was to boot it up without signing in, updating the phone to the June update, and the factory resetting it for a clean start. I didn't use smart switch or recover any apps as many have suggested, and manually downloaded all apps I need/want, around 40 in total, but it didn't take too long to do. I uninstalled Facebook as I don't use it, have bluetooth turned off unless I need it, and GPS turned on. Other than that, I've not done much in the way of battery saving. I've not suspended any apps, not put anything to sleep etc. like I've seen in other posts, and this is my battery life as of now: https://i.imgur.com/he3zroD.jpg
6h 19m screen on time, taken off charge 1d 11h ago and 22% left. As you can see, I'm a fairly light user, and I've found the battery drains around 0.5-1% per hour, but for me this is more than liveable. The battery reports that it's still learning my usage, so I guess this maybe still improve further. The phone itself has been incredibly smooth, and having come from a Pixel 5, I'm enjoying One UI. I also had constant complaints that I sounded distorted on calls from my Pixel, but have been told I sound very clear now, so overall I'm super happy with the phone so far.
Anyway, that's my take so far, although it would be ideal if you could setup the phone like every other phone, it seems like with a little time spent setting up the phone from fresh on the latest update, the phone and battery are totally usable, at least from my experience, so hopefully this is useful for someone who's considering buying one of the latest Galaxy models."

S22s and the Glass	"So after a few months of debating on buying the Pixel 6 Pro, researching all the issue, I decided to do it.  I had the phone for 9 days and everything actually worked.  I like it a lot.  I even got the Defender Otterbox because it was so much money and I wanted to protect it plus I saw posts of people's screens breaking for absolutely no reason.  
Well, I did what I could and my screen has two small hair line cracks from the lower right corner going up to the upper middle.  No drops, stress, etc.  I read a bit more and so many people have the issue.  Google refuses to do anything and Best Buy will not take it back.  
I have to fix it myself.  But to spend the 200$ (or whatever the cost is) to fix a 9 day old phone seems silly.  And then on top of that, it happens to a lot of these phones.  What is the say it will not happen again?  I took very special care of this thing and it still did it.  I just can't sink the money into it.  I'll toss it once I decide on a new phone.  
I was looking at the Pixel 5a w/ 5G.  But again, do I even want to give google anymore?  Obviously their pro 6 has some issues and nothing is being done.  So I'm about to move on and spend another 1K out of my pocket on a phone.  Before I do...
What glass type does the S22s use?  Any known issues where those screens just break from almost no use?  I do not want to go through this again.  I've had 2 Galaxy phones back in the days too and they were not bad.  So I feel like if I say FU to google and go with a new Samsung, will it hold up better then the toys Google put out with the pixel 6?"	N

Meaningless charging times	Hello everyone, i bought original 25w charger from samsung for my s22. When at 10% it shows 1 hour 5 min to full.

Battery getting better. Base S22	"This was my first flagship phone and I was really frustrated to say the least. Initially there was only about 3-4 hours SOT and even with or without it battery hardly last 6-7 hours in total. Now the best I got was 7 hours SOT and 9 hours of screenoff time(includes my 6 hours sleep time) from 100% to 20%. 
I had used smart switch. After reading a few forums such as this, I reset my phone and started from scratch. There was an immediate change for better. Some other things I did
Turn adaptive battery off (idk if this is helping but anyhow did it because many people suggested it)
Suspend execution of cached apps
Removed some bloatware (tbh there is no standard list. Just sit with it for an hour or two. Google all the process and remove the ones that are safe to remove and unnecessary to you. I disabled and uninstalled about 30-40 processes)
I strongly suggest using bixby routines. Make good use of samsung good lock, guardian apps.
Put apps in deep sleep. All the ones you don't care about their notifications. 
Completely reduce all activity, brightness at night. I used power saver only at night. You don't need power saver or to reduce screen refresh rate otherwise. 
The best performance comes when you are on wifi. Without Wi-Fi it's about 15-20 percent lesser. I don't use camera much so idk how it factors in."	N

S22u exynos battery life after 2nd June update.	Today was my first full day of use after the 2nd June update. Although it was a small update, it brought big improvements for my device.

Seems only 1 ""work"" profile can be used, and it had to be managed by an Org? Or are there other types of profiles? Are these better isolation tools than just different accounts? Are Samsung accounts even secure, private safe? Since you can only use a Samsung, ggle or Org account this seems weird unless... And are the profiles and the ""accounts"" the same thing?

Is this normal? Dropping 20% in just an hour with the brightness turned down to half too. I only got this phone about a month ago. Starting to wonder if I got a dud and should return it for a refund and just switch to iOS at this point.

My pixel 6 can last literal hours playing YouTube videos at full brightness and barely drop to 80% from 100%, meanwhile this thing will drop 30% if I decide to watch a YouTube video and browse social media for an hour :/

June Update HUGE improvements	"Ive had about one day+ now to test the June Update and this phone is NOW finally where it should be for a $1300+ phone.....
Although it was imo the best phone out the last few months, small things like idle drain inconsistencies, and decent to average battery life the phone has finally reached a notable improvement since the 2nd may update and finally the June update has finally refined most things. 
Other small little bugs like an app or process stuck in background draining battery or causing heating, which happened once or twice and tracked it to soundcloud and tiktok specifically affecting galaxy devices but only happened twice.
After doing the june update, and running galaxy app booster my idle battery drain last night was down to 0.4-0.5% per hour which is the lowest ive ever seen it. 
Usage all on LTE
Its really hard to tell if Screen on time improved or the benefits are from lower idle drain, but im currently at 55% with just about 5 hours screen on time now... Which ive never had before.
Usually ill be around 3.5-4 hours SOT around the 50 mark, but somehow im nearly at 55% still left with nearly 5 hours sot now.... which is insane.
And i cant get over how smooth it finally is now. 
Anything that required a less than simple animation would contain tons of micro stutters, or one brief frame drop then the rest if the animation becomes smooth. 
It was kind of annoying the micro stutters or frame drops, on simple animations, and then of course super heavy animations occasionally delayed, and it wasnt reproducable each time.
Im glad to say that battery is now great, but it finally got decent/good from the 2nd may update, and performance is now where it should be. Everything is super smooth finally, it runs very cool and doesnt get hot under normal usage and stays very cool for an 8 Gen 1 phone.
They also fixed the micro stutters specifically in reddit and twitter, which i thought was an app issue, as my Pixel 6 Pro does it too. The laggy notification drop down menu/micro stutters also fixed, basically the whole device now runs smooth 99%+ of the time interacting with it, as it should of before.
Was dailying a 13 Pro and Pixel 6 Pro but now that those gripes are gone, the S22 Ultra is easily my favorite again out of the 3."	N

It seems that I'm constantly hitting something that sends the person I'm on the phone with a request from me to stream them video from my phones camera. Usually happens when I'm holding it with my shoulder and ear. Is there a setting where I can stop this? I've looked but not sure what actually addresses it.	N
Should I get the S22+ or the S22 Ultra	"I am very aware of the differences between these two phones just about spec by spec as I have been doing an abundance of research since they first came out watching YouTube reviews and so on. I really love the design of the S22+, I'm in love with it actually. That's why then given the choice between these two phones I can't really deside because while I don't nessisarily dislike the design of the S22 Ultra I am concerned about the handibility and durability. I also like the zoom lense of the S22 Ultra. 
If you were given the choice which phone would you get? The phone with good ergonomics or the phone with some better features mostly to do with the camera and a slightly better screen. I mean the battery life is about identical on both of these. For anyone who actually helps me out, thank you in advance :)"	N

Former S21 Ultra Users, is the S22 Ultra worth the extra $150?	"Hi, 
I'm planning on upgrading my 4 year old s9 for a newer phone. I have my eyes set on either the s21 ultra or the s22 ultra. I can get an open box s21u for about $650-700 on Ebay, or I can get a brand new s22u on the Samsung website for about $850. Do you guys think it's worth the extra money for a new s22 ultra, or should I just get the oopopeopen box s21u? They both have the same storage space (256 GB)"	N

What's the best case under ¬£20, and are camera covering cases needed?	Spigen Liquid Air, Tough Armour, or Optik? Is the Nilkin equivalent to the Spigen Optik - the Nilkin Camshield - any good?

Any advice on using the s22U in very hot countries?	I've gone to Pakistan for 2 months to visit my family and it's always 40C or higher here and my s22U is always hot. Even on FHD 60hz I'm getting only 3hrs SOT on a full charge. I know the phone drains faster in hotter environments but it seems a little excessive. Switched to 120hz and getting the same battery life. Also noticed that I lose about 15% overnight compared to the normal 8-10% that I did in the UK. I have had to put my phone in the fridge for a couple minutes to bring it down a few degrees. Any advice on how to keep the phone battery healthy or at least make sure it's not always hot?

Can see the proximity sensor even when it is not active on my S22 Plus.	Hi everyone, I notice that on the display of my S22 Plus you can see the proximity sensor even when it is not active. On the gray screen and medium brightness, at the top right, exactly above the proximity sensor, I notice a lighter halo and if you look closely, there are two dots in the back and in the upper one you can see the 4 backlit dots of the proximity sensor. By running the proximity sensor test, as it happens, it lights up exactly above that area. Is it normal to see it even when it's off? Sure it's normal, but on the S21 Plus I've never noticed.	N

voicemail acting weird	"Hey anybody seen a problem like this? I'm on Samsung Galaxy S22 ultra with tmobile.

1. Any way to turn off vibration for notification while I am actively using the phone? I find that it messes up the haptics while typing and makes it feel like its stuttering. The pop up alone would be sufficient to notify me since I am actively using the phone. 
2. Change the expand button in PIP to be a larger button? On the pixel the expand button was right in the center of the PIP window and basically acted as a double tap to expand, I kind of got used to this and now the expand button is a tiny tap target.

Switched fm midrange (A71) to flagship (S22U). 15-day experience.	"Decided to switch from midrange cause this phone looks so gorgeous.
So far pros and cons:
Pros:
* The design. Got several compliments on it. Looks and feels so premium!
* Camera. It's insane! Best feature for me. Huge difference compared to A71's.
* SPen's so useful for me.
* Battery. Would never finish S22U in a day. A71, sometimes Id charge twice/day.
Cons:
* Vibration is too soft for S22U.
* A71 sounds better for me.
* A more personal one but S22U is a phone I'd worry about. Since it's expensive, I have to be careful with it. Def missing the carefree attitude I have with a midrange which I won't mind dropping or scratching lol.
Verdict: Would still go for it though it's 3x the price. Worth the investment since my phone's always with me, might as well have the best one ;)"	N

Anyone have any good links to buy a good screen protector for my S22 Ultra?	"So I've already bought the phone and I did purchase a screen protector from Aliexpress in advance and installed it.
The requirements to be a good screen protector are: 
\- UV Cure Glue
\- 100% Tempered Glass and clear
\- Curved around the curved screen completely to the sides
The one I bought is alright, with the only issue being the glass does curve but not all the way around. It leaves a 2mm gap on either side and a 1mm gap at the top on bottom. Ideally it should cover the screen entirely. I have a feeling this one was created so you could still use a case as well but I don't use cases.

Flashing unlocked firmware on your S22.	"Not sure if you guys are aware, but you can actually flash the unlocked firmware on your S22 which completely removes all the carrier bloatware.  It is a way better experience and includes Smart Call (great caller ID function that's free), which is disabled on the carrier variant firmware.

megapixels on different cameras	"Hey I have a question about the S22 camera. When I have it on 3:4 it shoots in 50mp. Average file size is 500kb. When I take the exact same picture but on ""full"" the average photo size is 1.5-2mb.
Does the ""full"" resolution take a better picture hence the larger size?

Can I use WiFi sharing (hotspot) on a deactivated Samsung?	"I currently have an S22 Ultra as my personal phone.  But I have an S9 for my work phone.  My company has given up on Android and now only uses iPhones for work.  I'm due for a new work phone and the S9 is getting pretty slow.  BUT there is one feature I actually use a lot when I travel.  WiFi sharing.  I use it so that I can connect my S9 to the hotel's WiFi and then I connect my personal phone, tablet, laptop, even a Chromecast to the S9's hotspot.  It is kind of like my own little router.
So the question is: If when I switch, and they deactivate my S9 from AT&amp;T will I still be able to use the Hotspot with WiFi sharing?  Or will the S9 simply not allow me to activate the Hotspot?
Anyone have a deactivated Samsung and can test this out for me?"	N

Can you use the S-pen Air Commands as an actual cursor?	"Hey, all. I hope this is the right place to ask this. I desire to use my S-pen as if it were a mouse, so while resting in bed I could use it as a standalone cursor without need to touch the phone. I know how to use air commands connected with certain apps to scroll up or down, and that is very useful. But I specifically want to use it to control my entire phone by S-pen using a cursor of sorts,  without being near the screen. Is it possible to maybe program the S-pen so that if you hold down the side button, it can turn into a standalone cursor on the screen?

Options to trade in/sell	"Hello everyone,
I pre-ordered the S22+ and received it February. Love the phone, but I got a new job and I think the S22 Ultra would benefit me because I take a lot of notes on the fly now (which the Spen would help with). 
I'm wondering what my options are to get a good value for my S22+. You can't trade it into Samsung for the Ultra, so do any other places do trade in deals? Selling it is another option but I see S22+ going for $500-700 on FB marketplace, which I think is a bad deal for an almost new phone."	N

What is your Samsung Galaxy S22Battery Life	I know a lot of users and tech reviewers stated that the battery life is not impressive compared to Apple.

Best protective case with a clear back?	"Sorry to add to all the other case advice posts, but looking for some help. 
&amp;#x200B;
The case I'm leaning towards is the Ghostek Nautical. I don't need a waterproof case (and seems it doesn't always pass the test anyhow) but it looks like a good amount of protection and the extra bumpers on the corners can't hurt. The slim nautical looks good but I've heard it has a hard outer shell vs a rubber grip on the original. Not a deal breaker but the peace of mind that my phone is less likely to slip out of my hand is a plus. 
&amp;#x200B;
Otterbox and Samsung both have completely clear options but they look pretty thin. I hate to add anymore bulk or weight than needed to an already monster of a phone but protection is the most important factor right now... if I can keep it from being an eyesore then that's a bonus.

I miss old features, how can I get them back?	"I miss old features, how can I get them back?
On previous versions of galaxy phones, there were some really cool features that I loved. I remember hovering my finger over the answer or reject buttons would activate them; awesome if I'm cooking or something. Videos would auto pause if you looked away and play again when you looked back; great for following a tutorial. I could use voice command for answering and ignoring the phone, and silencing an alarm.
Now I'm on my S22 Ultra, and I miss all those features. Sure, we got cool new ones, but why did we have to lose those?
Are there any apps that can recreate some of these features? Or are some of them hidden away in that damn Bixby app?"	N

Overall though it's a great app and the full version is $10. Well worth it imo. [A few hours in infinite painter can give some nice results. ](https://i.imgur.com/n7pTU7h.jpg)

Exchanging my iPhone 13 for S22 Plus	I recently traded in my iPhone XS Max for iPhone 13 and I'm not happy with it as I don't see any upgrade with it, the 13 is a good phone but its battery life is not good and the screen is smaller than my the screen XS Max had, Before making this decision I was afraid for the past week as changing OS's is not easy, but now I have made up my mind to shift to Samsung as the One UI has better features and looks more polished compared to iOS and Apple is locking most of the features coming in its next OS for the upcoming iPhones like AOD is going to be iPhone 14 Exclusives ffs, I am done living in apple's ecosystems as I can't simply connect my phone to PC and move files easily. with every new 15.X release they destroy battery life of the phone for instance when the phone came on iOS 15.2 it gave me 8hrs SOT now with iOS 15.5 it gives me only 4-5hrs of SOT and it's not even a month old phone. The OS itself is stable and lets you do basic stuff but nowadays they are trying so hard to lock their users into the ecosystem with subscriptions. I am proud to say that today I am exchanging my iPhone 13 for an S22+ although I have seen some negatives opinion about the new s22 series but I am still going for it as the design and aesthetics of s22+ is cleaner, the phone looks and feels premium, has 120Hz display, Better cameras, better OS freedom, Better speakers and the most important thing is the USB C port. All in all, I am super excited for experiencing android with One UI for the first time.	N
Samsung S22 over Samsung A50?	Currently own the Samsung A50 and am fine with it. Current phone plan offered free upgrade to Samsung S22 or $800 off it's upgraded models and z flip 3 models.

A52 vs S22 (specifically the camera)	"Basically what the title says. I know alot of people are going to recommend the flagship, but I've been weighing the advantages of having an SD slot and headphone jack with better specs and all. The make or break would probably be the A52 camera's performance, specifically in lowlight and night. If it's decent enough I might just go with the A52. Money isn't a real issue here, but saving a few hundred bucks is always nice.

Best screen protector for S22 Ultra	Hey fellow S22U owners. If you were having trouble (like me) looking for the best screen protection for your S22 Ultra while still retaining the FULL accuracy and responsiveness of the in display fingerprint scanner, I have found it!I have bought almost all of the well known brands of screen protector and have been mostly disappointed with how they hinder the fingerprint scanning accuracy, especially the LOCA based protectors. If you used your phone naked, you know how fast the fingerprint recognition can be and no matter which screen protector I applied it always messes with how well it could scan. Even the Whitestone Dome disappointed me. Well, I finally found the perfect one in my opinion. The official Samsung screen protector for the S22 Ultra! While it's not glass, it IS very nice feeling, not plasticy or mushy soft like other non glass protection. It feels very similar to the naked screen and the best part is fingerprint recognition is literally perfect! It's the same as having no protector on the phone. I didn't even have to re-learn my fingerprints. They are fairly priced as well, about $17 shipped on Amazon for a 2 pack. If you're interested, here's the link:https://a.co/d/fWeLyJVI've been using for about 2 weeks and I have zero regrets using it over the $50 Whitestone Dome.	N
Galaxy S22 poor video calls quality on Exynos	I have a Galaxy s22 with an Exynos 2200 chip and I noticed that the quality of video calls in Google DUO, Instagram, Microsoft Teams, etc is poor. For example, my wife has a Galaxy S20 FE with a Snapdragon chip. During a video call via DUO, the S20 FE has several times better image quality from its camera.This is a screenshot from the Galaxy S20FE. This picture is transmitted by my S22:And this is a screenshot from my S22. This picture is transmitted by S20 FE:The difference is huge. With the Galaxy S20 FE works HD quality in DUO. The problem is definitely not related to the quality of the Internet connection. The comparison was made on smartphones connected to one WiFi network. All other messengers in the S20 FE have better video quality. I suspect that the problem is somehow related to the Exynos chip. Maybe the video encoder is not optimized for it, I don't know. Are anyone has such an issue? Maybe this is a well-known problem with the Galaxy s22 and the company plans to fix it through an update?	N

S22 Ultra - 8 Gb vs 12 Gb RAM	"Anyone with real experience comment on the difference between 8 Gb and 12 Gb of RAM on the S22 Ultra? I'm a fairly heavy ""office app"" user - Teams, Outlook, Office, OneNote (looking forward to the S-Pen), can be heavy PPT slide decks et.c.
For some reason our designated supplier at work only has the 8 Gb variant... go figure üôÑ so getting the 12 Gb if at all possible will require jumping through hoops... but if I'm keeping the damn thing for 4-5 years I want something solid.
Also, waiting for S2x model is not an option. Need a new one now. Other brands are also a no-go.

It looks like this update is only out for exynos variant devices.

Any good back protectors for my S22 ultra that have the same texture as the back of my phone?	" 
I just got my S22 utlra and I honestly have no idea how but i've noticed white scratches on the back of my phone. Before anyone says it's just dust and you can rub it out, it really can't be rubbed out. I have no idea how these scratches appeared, I thought the glass was extremely hard but never the less they exist. Personally I won't put a case on it, what's the point of such a nice feeling phone to just put a case on it and never get to experience it. So, I was wondering, are there any good back protectors that somehow emulate the texture of the back of an S22 Ultra?
Honestly, I've always thought something like this was an amazing idea and I figured so many companies would be onto it. A protector for the back of the phone that feels like the back of the phone, not some leather or plastic film."	N

Charging Port Troubles	"Hey all, just got this phone two weeks ago. Two days ago for some reason it kept telling me that moisture was detected or a foreign object was in the port and told me to dry it/ shake it...the normal BS. Waited, dried it, cleaned it, and kept getting the same message. Dis some research on the googles and it told me to go into the system files, USB settings, and force stop it and clear the cache too before rebooting. It worked with the charger for a short period of time and then I would get the message again. 
Now when that doesn't happen I can plug in the charger and either it won't recognize that it's connected at all or it will say that it will take 14 hrs to charge to 100% from 80%. Tried multiple cables, charging blocks, swapped outlets, reboots, you name it. I'm at the end of my rope and could use some assistance. I think my brand new phone is F'd."	N

Can't have have google photos as my default for selecting photos in things like messages and viber.	"Had my S22U for a couple months. When I first got it I had no issue with using Google photos for anything, he'll I didn't even know kw Samsung had their own garbage known as gallery.
Unfortunately I shattered my phone and went to get it repaired. Samsung ended up reseting my phone, but when I got it back today I noticed I can't have google photos be my default anymore.

Case with screen protector, fingerprint compatible?	"I am now on to my 5th case. I hate the gel screen protector.
There are some gorgeous cases out there, but the one I ordered that had a magnetic front and back, with camera lens protector, wasn't compatible with fingerprint.
So now I'm looking for one compatible with the s22 ultra fingerprint sensor. ""Ultrasonic""
If you know of one, I'd greatly appreciate it.
I took off the gel screen protector that was always bubbling up when I got my new case, but then the fingerprint didn't work so I switched back.
Of course I dropped my phone and cracked my screen. So I'm on my second screen.
Suggestions would be greatly appreciated. This doesn't seem to be noted on many of the third party cases, and I am sick of trial and error. I've ordered cases that I thought were 2 piece that actually were not.
Thank you"	N
Just want to get this off my chest (Battery Life)	"I have fully factory restored, flashed unlocked firmware on the device and did not use SmartSwitch.  I see a lot of folks recommending certain settings which is fine, I'm sure they can help idle drain, but the main culprit for bad battery life is the screen.  I have what I feel is the most optimal setup with out many background processes running. 
The issue with the battery life is with the screen on time itself and nothing as far as I can tell can change this.  I take the phone off the charger, play a youtube video for 10 minutes and I'm down 3-5%.  From my consistent experience, I have been measuring the device to last around 4-5 hours of on screen time at maximum.
It's just the nature of the S22.  It's hot and it has poor battery life.  I don't think there's anything that can change it.  I don't really like my iPhone 13 Pro because of how restrictive iOS is, but I can use that thing all day without the battery taking such a huge hit, where as my s22 is basically ticking down the battery as I'm watching something.
This is on the Snapdragon variant."	N
Reverting back to Google Messages	"I'm just wondering how I can get back to the stock Google Messages app, and quit using the AT&amp;T version? I've had the phone since launch, and they still haven't fixed RCS. I remember reading that it was primarily an issue with the AT&amp;T version of Google Messages. 
RCS worked for me on my previous S21U, and now doesn't work at all with anyone. This includes people who are also on AT&amp;T. I have about 11 or 12 people who it worked with, with various Galaxy devices and different carriers. 
Thanks!"	N
Google Message/RCS reactions?	"So recently got the new S22 ultra. The phone was purchased directly through Samsung (unlocked) with a T-Mobile sim. Others (ie Apple devices) are able to react to my message, and I actually see the reaction now instead of getting another message ""X liked your text...""

Battery usage not reflected in Device Usage/Battery Tracker app. S22 Ultra Exynos 1TB	"This issue only seems to have occurred after the June update, but the device care Battery Usage section and Battery Tracker (from Good Guardians) don't seem to be reflecting my actual battery usage.
[Usage from Device Care settings, doesn't add up to 15%](https://i.imgur.com/X7uaDNN.jpg)
[Usage in Battery Tracker (also doesn't add up to 16%)](https://i.imgur.com/1ItSn1N.jpg)
I'm confused as to whether something that these wouldn't track is currently attacking the battery. I have most setting enabled currently (full resolution, 120hz etz), but I'm unsure if this would cause major drain that these apps wouldn't track. I reset my phone to factory just before the June update released, but it's getting tiring seeing this drain; idle drain also seems to have jumped up where I didn't have much of a problem before. Anyone else seen this?"	N
Powerbank for S22 SD	"I'm using S22 SD right now and the battery is a little bit bad, i wanna buy some powerbank , can you guys recommend me a good one?

My best battery life yet on Exynos!	"I've come to the conclusion that Samsung settings and 'optimisation' just make absolutely no sense on the S22 series.
I've been playing around with my settings &amp; apps for the past couple months and I'm finally managing to get 4-5 hours of SOT with at least 18 hours usage on my regular S22 exynos model. Perfect for a full day of use for me.
[Battery Stats](https://imgur.com/a/RG4KzSY)
My biggest finding are:
1. Spotify is the biggest battery draining app in the world, I swapped to YouTube music and my battery life doubled.
2. Samsung's high processor speed is more battery efficient than optimised speed.
3. Downloading goodlock modules &amp; apps to try and improve the battery only makes it worse, keep your device as stock as possible.
4. 'Adaptive battery' makes your battery drain faster.
5. Using goodlock theme park with custom icons &amp; themes kills your battery life, stick with stock oneui and the android 13 theming system.

"I'm not sure what happened or what caused this but after dealing with ridiculously mediocre battery life, I thought let me do a fresh factory reset and manually download everything and not use Smart switch, come to find out that is one of the many culprits that people are dealing with for the battery drain. To give you an idea now, I took my phone off the charger around 7:30 a.m. and still had 11% by 11:20 p.m. with moderate to heavy use which was no different than my experience on battery with my S21 Plus. I'm shocked that this is causing such terrible drain by Smart Switch and I highly advise anyone dealing with terrible battery to do a factory reset and manually install things.

Would it be better for me, coming from a 6.7" phone, to go for the s22 or the s21 fe? I am growing to prefer the bigger phones, and both phones have wireless charging, which I tend to care about. Both of which will be supported until android 16 (if not please correct me), and performance of either will blow me away coming from whatever mediatek processor is in the a32.	N

I'm thinking of going for a film screen protector since I have a case and heard gorilla glass does a good job protecting against cracks. Any suggestions? I don't want anything that will lower the screen quality. I've had tempered glass on every phone with no issues."	N
How many of you have upgraded your s20 to s22?	So of course it's coming up on 2 years of owning my s20+ I'm still on the fence about upgrading. For me the esim seems to justify the upgrade as I am on firstnet too so I'm stuck with the snapdragon variant. I see Samsung is still incentivizing upgrading so I'm on the fence if it's worthwhile to upgrade or should I wait untill this phone craps out?	N
Samsung pass	So I just updated my cards in my samsung pass, and I can't find where you can create a nickname for your cards. Certainly I'm missing something somewhere.!! Many people have more than 1 Mastercard or visa. There is no way to differentiate between two different Mastercards? Come on samsung you need to Step it up!!	N
Anyone have a good way to manage music in iTunes	"Hi all, 
I have historically still used my iPod for listening to music, but was thinking about dropping my music in a music folder on my S22 Ultra. I am not sure how it will look, but are there any apps these days that produce a nice music management layout that you would recommend? 
Thanks"	N

Ok. finally going to buy it! three questions though	"Hey, so I'm gonna take the plunge for the s22 ultra since they added the summer sales to it, makes it just over 300 ( with trade in ) for the 256gb. 
Three questions though: 
What's the best color? I'm torn between green and graphite. 
Why are there so many samsung sales? Did the s22U sell that bad? Should I wait for a better sale?
What are the notable features of the s22U over the note 20 ultra?
P.S comments and recommendations are greatly appreciated! I'm a click away from buying it and going to get it today unless something else catches my eye."	N

Avoiding Smart Switch does actually help!	"I got my S22U 128gb Exynos version right when the phone was released and after being quite unsatisfied with the battery life (came from the S21U) I first hoped to see some improvements with the updates but nothing really happened. 
My usual battery usage was some streaming, social Media, audible and the camera &amp; Lightroom and I usually made it though every day with about 3-4h of SOT and 2-3h audible background use. 
Coming from the S21U and having a 5000mA battery made me hope for a good 6-7h SOT again but the S22U kept disappointing me. 
I finally made the cut and exported all my photos and videos to my laptop and did a reset of the phone and started it up again without using smart switch this time. 
It took me about 4 hours to reinstall everything manually and bring everything back to my settings &amp; importing my photos and videos again. 
Now after about two weeks with this ""new"" device I get about 6h of SOT and I definitely make it through every day and get about 5h of SOT with a 2-3h audible session in the background. 
Still not as good as the S21U and Samsung definitely f**** something up here but still it's Matching my use case now! 
Hope I could motivate some of you to try this and ask me for any questions!"	N

what would it take for Samsung to get rid of shutter lag?	I have been asking since s20, then s21 and now S22. Every now and then, users say it is improving after update. But after many months it is still there. Just not as quick as iphone and pixel for taking photos of moving animals and kids. If pixel can do it, it cannot be some hardware limitations. Sometimes turn on the camera app is slow too. Is this too difficult to solve? With flagship specs and at least 8g ram. I don't know how come Samsung still not solve this....	N
Another rant about the S22, and Samsung (but not about the battery)	"TLDR; Coming from an S10 my new S22 (both EU/Exynos) is probably the worst phone purchase I've done, but not because it's bad in any way. The s22 is fine, or even good, but is just isn't the double generation upgrade i expected. And Samsung have become complacent. 
I've always regarded Samsung favourably, maybe even borderline a fan, and had several Samsung devices (including a screen and smart TV).
First the good stuff compared to the s10: The s22 is smaller, slightly faster, slightly better battery (controversial opinion here), slightly better camera and a 120hz screen is neat. More on board memory is nice.
But in many ways the s22 is just a straight downgrade from the s10:
The screen is 1080p down from 1440p which isn't terrible but a downgrade none the less, especially when there is little win on the battery. It is 120hz, yes, but frankly it is under normal use as perceptible (or imperceptible) as going to 1440p. Then we have no SD expansion slot even though the SIM tray clearly large enough to support being a combo dual sim/SD tray. So bye up to 1tb of extra storage and hello paying way too much for 128gb extra built in. We lost the headphone jack, even if I suppose we are all wireless now, it was something i actually used in a pinch. The powershare on my s10 supported dual charging but now the powershare refuses to share power when the charger is plugged in, making it much less of an option for night-charging your watch. 
Seeing the perks of upgrading was marginal and the downgrades in some cases significant I am really wondering why I'm paying 50 odd dollars a month for this phone when I had an s10?
Now for the rant on Samsung in general: Their support and software side is horrible and they genuinely do not care about customer satisfaction. My screen had terrible ghosting at 60hz which they never decided to fix (but none at 144hz), my TV randomly restarts itself when playing YouTube and they have no plans on fixing that anytime soon, I was supposed to get earbuds with my s22 but apparently a receipt with a 25 dollar deposit for ""pre-order"" isn't evidence I actually preordered it, Samsung Pay use 25% of the battery on my Watch 4 if NFC is on and I can't uninstall or deactivate it... And in regards to any review or complaint about any of these issues Samsung doesn't even bother to patrol sites like Trustpilot and address people. 
I heard Sony makes good phones."	N
How can I get rid of Brief/Detailed Pop-Ups but keep notifications in status bar?		N
what should I buy, s22+ or ultra?	"I currently have an s20 5g which only has 128gb but 12 gb of ram. I need a new phone and am eligible for an upgrade which will cost less overall than my current plan (in Canada). I usually upgrade every year or two because battery life inevitably starts to suffer and I'm on my phone a fair bit. I'm debating between the 256gb versions of the s22+ and the s22 ultra. My only hesitation on the ultra is the size and the extra $12.34 per month it will cost me on a 24 month contract (if I go with the plus my new plan will actually cost about $15 less than I currently pay).
I have an infant and take a lot of photos of her, I carry my phone in my pocket and both are larger than what I'm used to. The previous largest phone I'd had (by pure size) was the nexus 6 for width at 80.9mm or the oneplus 7t which was 160.9mm. I didn't have an issue with either in my pocket.
Probably the biggest concern I have is battery so I'm curious how people feel in their personal experiences which phone would be the best option. I've never had an s pen device (other than a tab s6 lite) but find that somewhat intriguing."	N
Do any third party cases have a case that turns the screen on and off?	I am thinking of getting the s22 ultra. My s20 plus uses the official samsung case. That when opening turns the screen on. Does that tech work only for samsung's accessories? Or are there third party cases that do the same thing.	N
Recovering data from S22+	"Hello,
I was camping with my S22+ and it fell on a rock. The screen worked fine for a bit with a small crack, but a few hours later it would not work at all. I've tried to reset several times and the phone will vibrate, but the screen will not turn on.
I've completed an RMA to have it replaced. However my biggest concern is that there are a bunch of photos I've taken that were not backed up to Google Photos before the phone broke. I've tried connected to my PC with a USB cord but cannot seem to access the phone. The ""Find my Mobile"" on Samsung cannot locate my phone, so it seems it is not on despite vibrating. 
Is there any way I can recover these photos?"	N
Samsung.com exclusive colors	"Hi everyone! So I've recently purchased new Galaxy S22 Ultra Sky Blue. And I know i might have to wait a lot. But anyway, the tracking status is ""in process"" and the estimated delivery date is 23rd of June, but before that 4 days ago it was ""Backordered"" and the delivery date was by 28th of June. So is it possible that they can send it fast enough, because it's in stock? Or I'm gonna wait 5 weeks?  How do you think?
Thanks"	N

Question about factory reset/phone updates	"So I've made a couple of posts/comments recently and lurked to find optimal settings for the base S22 I got. Mine was overheating and the battery was awful, as was the charging if the phone was even a tiny bit warm already.
Ultimately, I exchanged my phone for a new S22 on Saturday, and so far it has been much better (I did use SmartSwitch in the store). However, today it is not as good and I've barely used it. I'm hoping it's just a fluke with losing battery faster, but first thing this morning it was still great and then out of nowhere seemed to worsen. I have done a lot of the tips I have seen posted on settings and I think they've been great suggestions. However, I am wondering about the Smart Switch thing and factory resetting and how this works.
Our plan doesn't have the 600 gb free cloud yet (working on that--Verizon did not explain things to my parents and didn't even give this option to all of us, just randomly put it on my mom's line and didn't ask who to put it on). I don't want to lose my pics, contacts, texts, etc. I know everyone said they then manually downloaded all of their apps again.
So what is your process? Do you guys have the cloud and that's how you keep all your important stuff? Did you just write down a list of all your apps? What other things would I need to know when doing this if I find I need to?
My phone hasn't gotten much use today because I was at work whereas I got to use it more this weekend, but at least it didn't seem to get that hot. I think it'll still need a week or two to adjust to my usage (I don't have adaptive battery or adaptive power on) so I am going to wait, but it'd be nice to know what to do in case I have to go this route.
Finally, I have not downloaded the updates for the phone (including the June one, I think there are two or three updates to download). Should I download these or hold off for a bit?
Sorry for the wall of text, I appreciate all the tips from my fellow sad S22 owners!"	N
S22 Not Unlocking After 60 Days	"So I got my S22 Ultra on release day. I was told by many people that it unlocks after 60 days after activation. I tried to add T-Mobile e-sim and the phone said I can't because it's locked to Verizon. So is the 60 days true? Or do you need to fully pay it off for it to be ""completely unlocked""?
Here is the error;

Has an S21, any reason to go to an S22?	"Verizon's offering the promotion where if you trade in your old phone you get a ""Free"" new phone.
All said and told I'd be paying like $130ish for an 256GB S22 5G
Looking at the specs though it seems like the S22 5G is a bit of a downgrade?  Slightly smaller screen, and a smaller battery, no real difference in cameras.
https://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=11253&amp;idPhone2=10626

S20+ 4G &gt; S22U 5G?	"I have bought my S20+ 2 years ago and I'm thinking about upgrading to the S22 Ultra, both Exynos variants. I usually keep my phone 2 years, but unfortunately when I bought my S20+ 4G I didn't think at the time that 5G was going to be deployed this quickly so I didn't pay extra for it. I'm looking for a 5G phone I could use for social media and media consumption (shows, films, YouTube), as the display is apparently good, and good cameras. This time I'll try to go for 3 years with it, since we'll get software updates for longer. 
As of today, how's the battery life on the Ultra Exynos? I've heard that some recent update improved it quite a lot. I don't play games at all on mobile or do some crazy video editing stuff. 
So, do you think it'll be a decent upgrade? Although I've never used an S-Pen, I'm confident I'll use it for note taking, signing docs, etc.
What do you think of the phone?"	N
Possible S22 screen on time improvement with June update	Did anyone notice an improvement in battery life after the June update? I just got this phone a week ago and I was initially disappointed due to the battery life. I know that this is a small phone but I was barely seeing 4 hrs of screen on time and the idle battery drain was bad. Then the June update came and I also changed the processing speed to high from optimized. This seems to have improved things because now I get more than 5 hrs of battery life for the last 3 charge cycles. Idle battery drain is still the same and I am a little disappointed in this area. Did anyone experience similar behavior? How much screen on time do you usually get? Do you have any other tips for improving battery life?	N
Privacy screen protectors for Galaxy S22 Ultra	Does anyone know if there are any privacy screen protectors we can buy for the Galaxy S22 Ultra and if so what kind or brand.

HEX & S22	I used hex on my S21+. Loved it (and still do!!) After many issues (my fault entirely), finally got it working on my S22+. I saw the choice to do adb via Chrome and that worked much easier than going back and forth between screens with shizuku but the caveat is after reboot, you have to do the adb/Chrome setup again. After doing that a couple of times, decided to do shizuku. Now as far as I know, this is not supposed to happen when doing shizuku setup. Pretty sure I would have remembered that with the S21 because it is a bit of a pain to keep doing it and of course I rebooted my S21+ many times. Surprise, first time I rebooted my S22+ after doing shizuku and checking hex, saw that I needed to apply it again. Not sure it is related to S22 at all but wanted to get some feedback. Did something change in hex with the S22 series? Or has hex always worked that way and I just totally missed it?	N

[S22 battery usage](https://i.imgur.com/8RRYJP2.jpg)
I see a lot of hate about the s22 battery on here, and I just want to point out that just because it's a small battery doesn't mean it's a bad battery. It really depends on how you use it. Every phone's battery life depends on how you use it.

Had my first bad experience with my new S22 today	"I always listen to music when I walk to work. Unfortunately my headphones recently snapped in my bag (nothing that can't be fixed) but as I was in a rush this morning I didn't have time to put them back together.
Sudden light bulb moment, I have some earphones lying around in my drawer. I'll just use those. As I walk out the door and confidently get down the stairs, I go to plug in my lovely wired earphones and realise that my new S22 doesn't actually have a headphone jack.
God damnit man.
I will never ever understand the decision to remove this feature from smart phones. My S10 could use Bluetooth headphones AND had wired headphone support. Just seems like a step in a massively wrong direction.

Or I, yet again, get a used s10  in a good state for about 150‚Ç¨ - 200‚Ç¨.
My s10 did a magnificent job until the day of the accident and I had no intention of upgrading for a while with it still working but with me needing buy a new Phone anyways I could either just go all in or save myself about 400‚Ç¨.
So I don't know how greatly I feel the upgrade from an s10 to the s22 and if it would justify the money on top of that.
I use my phone a lot of times on a day for a multitude of things like watching things, scrolling social media, play games like gacha games (Genshin impact, Azur lane etc) or use it for everyday things like browsing things or using Google maps and so on.
I know the specs but even so I would like hands on information  about their differences and if it feels like worth upgrading."	N
Tip for the camera app on S22+.	"After ranting on here earlier in the week about my S22+, ordering an iPhone 13 Pro Max to go back to iOS after 7 years... Well I'm still here I hated it. I just can't deal with iOS now, too many things done well on Android that I can put up with a not so perfect selection of hardware. 
Anyways.. one of my gripes was the camera app on the S22+.. this tip really is more of a placebo I think but improves the feeling of how a photo is taken by default. Within the camera app turn off 'Vibration Feedback'. The vibration to mimic the shutter of a camera snapping is not good it makes the camera app feel sluggish, this does not improve the speed of the shutter though unfortunately.
Who knows if the shutter speed will ever get fixed, simple change some may have missed here though."	N
I gonna get Samsung S22+ in 2,5 months	This phone is just perfect in size, from various tests it's camera quality is awesome, yea sure it don't have macro but underless i can try some tricks to get it. Design of this phone is just gorgeous, especially green color, bezels are even, not like in S22 Ultra, for real this phone is very expensive and still have "butt" also known as bigger bezel at bottom of screen, yea sure it's better but for me aestethics are way more important then QHD resolution screen. I think everyone understand that i just don't see sense in 1300$ phone to have not even bezels and phone that i found for 910$ on one website to be so gorgeous, that is still way better then my phone.

50 Million Unsold A Series Phones?	Samsung when will you ever learn? Hate to say it but you shot yourself in the foot. Let's examine why. First you took away the headphones,then you took away the chargers, the headphone jacks and had the nerve to price this year's series higher than last year's series with Exynos chipsets. The A72 needed a 5G/s5G versions like the A52 but still you dropped the ball. The A53/A73 phones needed telephoto sensors with 3x zoom with OIS,Ultrawide sensors with Autofocus instead of useless macro/depth sensors, 4k video recording with gimbal stabilization across all sensors with no shakes and jitters,wireless charge,Samsung Dex,35w to 45w fast charging and 108mp main sensors across the board that's actually useful to compensate for the $500-$600 price tags. Right now you can get last year's A Series brand new for $100 -$200 cheaper from sellers on eBay. Or buy an older flagship series like the S20 series with all the bells and whistles. Point is Samsung stop offering less and taking away features most people love but demanding higher prices. And P.S. the S20/Note 20 series needs to be eligible for the 4 years of OS updates program,Android 13 should not be the capstone. Think about it.	N
Just got my S22 Ultra and it appears to be underperforming pretty badly	I have the S22 ultra with the exynos variant and it appears to be scoring extremely low on geekbench aswell as having bad camera quality for some reason, I just got it today, updated all the software on it and ran geekbench 5 with all background apps closed and processing speed set to max and this is the score I got...:The best I was able to get it to was with GOS disabled and the processing speed set to max was 620 single core and 3200 multicore which is still bad for an exynos 2200,this is very bad because I know that the exynos 2200 atleast scores 1100+ in this benchmark and idk what the **bleep** is going on here with my phone. but this gets even worse..Saying my camera performance is abysmal would be an understatement, my camera performance is bad, so bad in fact that I'm legit crying from pain looking at this:Night mode shot:108 MP shot in light:This camera quality just doesn't feel right at all for a flagship phone like this, please guys I need suggestions on what to do, I worked so hard to get this phone and I'm worried that something wrong is with it üòï please help, I've been waiting for my friend to bring me this phone from France for 3 months since I live in Tunisia, and I'm disappointedhow the phone that I was so excited for turns out like this, please help.

Pick up order stuck in process indefinitely.	So I have had this order placed since May 03 and as of today, its is June 22nd and still is stuck in process, I have already contacted E-commerce both on the website and on the phone and they said word for word "I have no idea why its still stuck in process, I do not know the solution to this" So as of now, my only other options is going to the bank and asking for a charge back because Samsung is not delivering me an order that I paid for.

Old phone saved in Samsung account	I tried contacting Samaung this morning with an issue I was having. When I selected the help icon it made me go through two step verification and it made me provide the code they sent to me. The only problem with that is Samsung sent it to my S20 that I do not have anymore. I traded it in when I purchased this S22 Ultra. There wasn't any way to chose what phone to send the code to. It automatically chose and input my old S20. I checked my messages , emails and no code was delivered. I resent the code 2 more times only to never receive it. Hoe can I update Samsung on. what phone I actually have? Odd to me they don't know this information...	N

SAMSUNG! STOP Dimming My S22 Ultra in Sunlight!	I live in Florida. Every time I use my S22 Ultra outside, it looks great for under 1 minute. Then, the brightness dims the screen making it very difficult to see.* Don't ask "have you tried...?" YES! It's NOT a setting issue. It's a Samsung software issue. Adaptive Brightness On/Off. Doesn't matter. Vivid vs. Natural. Doesn't matter.I've researched this issue & it states this "auto dimming in direct sunlight" happens relative to the battery % & phone temperature. NO! This happens every time. It does not matter if it's 100% battery & just came out of the air conditioning.Just issue an update where we can control this feature!	N

Trade in	I am very sorry to say that I was shocked to see that my trade in of S10 against S22 ultra was rejected. The reason being given is that the phone does not come on and the content has not been erased. My phone was in perfect working condition before I sent it for trade in and had done a factory reset too. Now I am going to be charged for the 375 dollars trade in value. I am wondering if this trade in program is even genuine and am very disappointed that a company like Samsung engages in these gimmicks to lure customers to buy newer phones. I wish I had not fallen in for this. I regret my purchase decision as I could have continued with my existing phone without being lured into buying a newer model at an apparent lower price.	N

Will Samsung Accept This Trade-In?	"I posted this in r/samsung yesterday but decided I'd try once more in a different sub before making any decisions.
I took advantage of the most recent trade-in promo and picked up an S22U, if only to hold one for a few days to see if the upgrade makes sense. I'm thinking about keeping it but I'm concerned about this blemish under the glass of my [S21U](https://www.imgur.com/a/3fArFaL) - it isn't cracked or broken, there's just that weird bubble underneath the glass.
Folks who have successfully traded phones with Samsung in the past, do you think they'll deny the trade-in because of that?
Yesterday, someone suggested using the new promo for cracked glass trade-ins but that would end up costing close to $150 more which kinda negates the reason I considered upgrading in the first place (cheapest possible new phone) so if the S21U isn't tradable I'll just stick with it for now."	N

What are you using for a messaging (text/MMS) app? I used YAATA for years but it doesn't seem to work on the S22Ultra and the Samsung messenger sucks.	"After upgrading from my S10 to the S22 Ultra , YAATA stopped working right, wouldn't get MMS/Photos just said Download and would always fail. So the helpful person at Verizon just switched me to the  Samsung messenger but it is wonky and not very easy to instant add photos or even set colors for each persons chat that I can tell - also the weird sending as MMS after like 90 characters and having to click to view more is pretty dumb.   
It could be that I am just old and don't want to go in and mess with settings and just want the stuff to work, or it could be this messenger app just sucks. So, what are you all using?"	N

Hats off to the genius at Samsung who rolled out a mandatory update to Samsung Pay that only reveals itself when you go to pay for something	"I stopped bothering to take my card with me to the supermarket a while ago, perhaps that's on me, and I'm sure Samsung Wallet is much better than Samsung Pay, and I'm sure it was somehow worth the 69mb download...
But having just spent a really fun 20 minutes at the Morrisons checkouts trying to get enough signal to download the update, only for it to fail, is it really too much to ask to be able to continue to actually **pay for things** while the update downloads!?
Or even just a simple notification warning me that I won't actually be able to pay for things until I've updated the app might have been helpful."	N

Is there a way to cap brightness at a certain percentage? Trying to prevent burn-in on my new phone.	I just got my S22 yesterday and I want to know if there is a way to cap the screen brightness. I previously had an S9 and it got burn-in around a year. I'm a driver for Doordash, Grubhub, Uber Eats, etc, so I'm using those and Waze alot. Doordash and Waze have been burnt into my screen. Is there any way I can prevent this on my new phone? I'm thinking if I don't allow my brightness to go over a certain point, that may help prevent this. I do have adaptive brightness turned on, but since I'm outdoors, it probably goes to max alot. Are the new screens more resistant to burn-in? I know if it happens within a year, it should be covered by manufacturers warranty. Any other tips to prevent this issue? Would using dark mode when available be a better option?	N

is there a way to increase BT Sound?	"Hey guys, (S22 Ultra) 
Since Android 12 // One UI 4.1 my Galaxy buds arent as loud as before (Galaxy s8 Plus lol)
Dont get me wrong, they are still loud and good, but If you used the S8 plus for years with its loudness, you will hear immediately the difference.
Is there a solution for this? An app? 
An setting? 
On my s8 Plus you could Change the Volumen of the buds and the Phone seperatly, but on my S22 Ultra you can only adjust the Media Volume, and that bothers me.

Samsung is Trash. I enjoy my S22U, but might be my last Samsung phone	"I was on the original pre-order deal. Ordered the day after the announcement.  Tried to get the galaxy watch 4 included for free, but the watch was sold out. So, I opted to wait for the promo code to be emailed. 
Now that I have the promo code, it won't work on the watch. Tells me this item is not eligible.  I spoke with support who also kept telling my that my code is not for a watch. Even though that was part of the original deal. I explained this to them and then was told I have to buy a watch to get one free with my code. Again, still not the original deal that was advertised. 
The support team proceeded to try and sell me chargers etc.
I finally spoke to a supervisor, who basically just confirmed that my code doesn't work for the watch and is ""escalating it to the promo department"" and that I should receive an email. (Not holding my breath). My code also expires on the 30th of this month. 
Such crap. Advertise the free watch, don't have stock, give me a code that doesn't work for the watch. So I have $250 to spend on chargers and shitty cases.

S22 Ultra Bought from Verizon, RCS, Dual SIM &amp; Auto-Data Switching	"Can anyone who has an S22 Ultra that they bought from Verizon tell me if the Samsung Messages app has RCS capability?  I know Samsung shipped S22s with Google Messages.  
I had bought an unlocked version directly from Samsung and it had Google Messages for RCS but Samsung Messages did for older models though.
The issue I ran into however is that Google Messages would refuse to auto data switch on my dual sim setup when I would receive or attempt to send an MMS on my secondary SIM.  When I tried a little window popped up asking me to go into settings to manually change the Primary SIM.  Samsung Messages wouldn‚Äôt do this but didn‚Äôt have RCS on the Unlocked Ultra. 
So, I was wondering what Verizon‚Äôs versions were like.  I was hoping someone here can tell me.  Of course, if anyone got Google Messages to successfully auto-data switch without the popup, I‚Äôd like to know what you did too. Lol. Thanks."	N

Switched from a S21 Ultra to S22+ and surprised by how much I like it	"So I have been using an S21 Ultra since it was released last year and have been quite happy with it all around. The cameras are great and of course the screen is top notch. The only thing I didn't love about it was the bulk which is why I returned the S22 Ultra after 4 days of use as it was even bulkier than the S21 Ultra and without having a use for the S-Pen it was hard to justify the upgrade.
So flash forward to this week and Best Buy is currently running a promotion where they allowed me to swap a Z Flip 3 for a S22+ and I only had to pay a small amount of sales tax ($29 to be exact) so I figured I would take advantage just for higher resale value later on.  
You can imagine my surprise though when I find out how great the phone feels in the hand and most shockingly that I could barely tell the difference between the S22+'s FHD display and the S21 Ultra's QHD one. In fact I believe the S22+'s gets brighter when in super bright sunlight. 
Obviously I know I will be losing some RAM in this switch but I am far from a power user so 8GB should be enough and while I will miss the 10X optical zoom it's just so nice to have a smaller phone again, plus in my limited comparisons I have found the S22+'s primary camera to be more reliable than the S21 Ultra's when it comes to focus and color reproduction.
Anyway I just wanted to post this for anyone else that might have a similar opportunity as Best Buy is offering the same ""free"" swap if you have a S21 Ultra and while a few months ago I would have thought it was a major downgrade to go from the S21 Ultra to the S22+ I now think it's more of a lateral move of trading some RAM and a 10X sensor for a much thinner and lighter phone where the other screen and camera differences are barely noticeable."

Considering purchasing an S22 Ultra to replace my old Note 10+, what do you guys think?	"Hello guys,
I have a Note 10+ 256GB, it's been a great phone, and still is a really good device but is getting old and the battery performance is getting worse, discharging rapidly. Also, having software lags and general performance issues, something to be expected from a 2019 device. Not sure if the Note 10+ will keep receiving upgrades (Android 13), and this is another reason to consider a replacement.
I've been doing some research and seems to be the S22 Ultra could be one of the best replacements, what do you guys think, do you think it would be worthy? any experience moving from the Note 10 to S22 Ultra? would you guys recommend a different device? .... I would appreciate any suggestions and ideas....... Thanks!!"	N

New S22 Ultra sluggish and benchmark is low??	I just got my S22 Ultra today and it was open box so not brand new.

I recently got an S22+ is it OK to use 30W charger for it?	I know the S22+ is rated for 45W charging, but as the phone doesn't come with a charger in the box, I'm forced to use the charger from my previous phone. Would it have any adverse affect on the battery using a 30W charger since it's rated for 45W. This might sound like a stupid question, but I'm not too familiar with different charging speeds and whether they affect overall battery lifespan or not.	N

New to Samsung (S22+) from Sony Xperia 1 mk2. Any way to add Side Sense to S22+?	"As stated in title, I recently joined the Galaxy family days ago, and Im liking it so far.
However I miss the Side Sense function from the Xperia. 
It is similar to the Edge Panel from the Galaxy, but with more gesture triggers. 
For example I was able to slide my finger up at the edge of the screen to bring up Recent apps menu, or slide down to minimize app.
Side Sense makes navigating the phone a lot easier with one hand.

A question about settings or factory reset and Smart Switch	"I tried posting a few days ago about how people carry over everything (minus apps) after doing a factory reset, but unfortunately no one answered (I'm not sure if this isn't the place for it or it's been asked before and I just can't find those posts). 
Anyway, I am on Verizon, and right now do not have access to the cloud to back up all of my stuff (working on possibly changing this soon). I want to have all of my pics, texts, call logs, and contacts for sure, but it sounds like ultimately I have to make a list of all the apps I need to manually download and do that. If I do reset settings, then I would need to change everything I've got set up, including home screen, passwords, settings in games/apps, etc. I'm doing my best to google and search reddit, but am a bit overwhelmed and nervous to mess it up, ha.
One of my questions is, whether I do the settings reset/wipe cache partition or a full on factory reset, if I do Smart Switch (I found out I can back up my device on my computer) and bring over everything EXCEPT apps, do people still have issues? Meaning I should just not touch Smart Switch at all, and have to just figure out some sort of cloud to bring over all of the things I need and rebuild my phone from there? 
I apologize for the wordiness and also idiocy, I've never had to do something like this with any phones and am so disappointed in my S22. I have the base SD, already had to exchange my first one because that was even worse and then this phone was great the first couple of days and now the battery is awful. Less overheating than the other, but still just trash. I also tried to play with Good Guardians but don't feel that did anything unless I was doing it wrong, and I have changed multiple settings based on some great posts here which I think help but unfortunately I think I have to do the last resort, which is either of those options and I don't want to fuck it up and lose important stuff on my phone. 
Thanks for any help or suggestions!
Edit: Also, I want to say I have had this new phone for less than a week, so I know even though it no longer says ""Learning usage patterns"" (I think it only said that for maybe two days tops) that it is still learning my usage patterns, but I feel like every day it gets worse. I am not a heavy user, but the heaviest app I use is Pokemon Go, sometimes just for a few minutes each day, other times it can be several hours. I do not have Power Saving on or Adaptive Battery as I read that actually can make it worse which sounds counterintuitive, so if I should turn any of those on let me know. I see arguments for both sides so I don't know which is true."	N

probably the worst battery in everything S22 Ultra in existence	"Hi I've been using my S22 Ultra (8gen1,512gb) for 3 months now, right after the launch. Switched from the OnePlus 7 pro.
I'm a relatively light user. My day consists of 1 hours of Spotif ( off screen) , 1 or so hours on YouTube and a little in Instagram. Saw people with light use at least lasting 5-6 hours, but here I'm getting at most 3 hours of screen on time. Most of my days I have 2:30 hours of battery life. Absolutely disappointed in everyway.
Info;
I run my phone at 1440p and 120 adaptive. Anyone having the same experience? I haven't seen anyone with 3 hours of SOT, it's insane. 
Edit:
I booked a check up next week, but most likely they will not replace my device I think. No freaking chance.
My 3 year old OnePlus 7 pro, I used for a few days to check the difference.
With the same usage, I get 4:50 hours of SOT on those few days average. Aboslutely ridiculous. How did Samsung's QC be so gosh darn bad.
Anybody have the same experience?"	N

Edit: I went with the Ultra, for 2 reasons. I want to not have to carry 2 ios devices, an iPad and iPhone when traveling for work. The other reason is because the s22u is out of my comfort zone as far as device preferences go. I tend to go for smaller devices with a flat screen."	N

got my s22 ultra graphite today!

If the s22 u gets $200 better trade in value for the s23u then it will be worth it!  
I liked the look of the s21 ultra better, the silver was beautiful, I liked the round edges, and I never had any issues with it.  It feels like a much more premium phone.  But, 175, and I needed the storage upgrade from 128.  I was never a fan of the pen, never really used it on my Note4, and barely used it for the s21, and barely on my tab S7+ either.  At that price though, what the hell.  Also got the exclusive NY insurance.  Not sure what that's a thing but it's $6/month.  Hopefully I get over the curves and enjoy the marginal improvements"	N

I have the phone on wifi all the time until around 1:45 am. Bixby routines turns it off at 1:45 am until 7 am.
Power saving is automatically triggered via Bixby Routines between 11:30 pm and 7 am the next day and whenever my battery falls below 30%
I put some apps which I really don't need immediate notification from to sleep
Data is turned on only when needed when I go out
I use adaptive 120hz unless the phone is in power saving

Disabled 5G since 5g isn't available in my area. Data is also very slow in our city so I usually just connect to some establishments' wifi when I'm out

On average, I get around 7.5-8 hours SOT during the first week, so having around 10 hours SOT from 100-20% is way more than enough for me. I just hope this battery life remains like this for a long time since I don't plan to upgrade within the next 5 years.

S22+ deal	Hello, not my first time posting. I decided to upgrade from my s22 to the s22+ for battery reasons, fit my lifestyle better. Recently found an open box deal at BBY for the 256gb model open box at 700 dollars. Is it worth it? It is a gift.	N
Does aod cause burn in?	I know the time and date move around periodically to avoid burn in but what about the fingerprint icon on the always on display? Couldn't that burn in since it doesn't move?	N
coming from note 9	"Overall the s22 ultra I ah e is absolutely fantastic. But one thing I just cant seem to get passed is the fingerprint sensor on the screen.  The back fingerprint sensor was in the perfect spot for me and I really enjoyed being able to slide my finger down it as a gesture for pulling down notifications and such. Having it on the screen in a specific spot that you can't see or feel just seems like a terrible idea to me and in practice seems like it's taking soooo long to get used to.

Tiny screen artifacing/glitching on S22 (Snapdragon)	"It happens for a split second though. First time it happened, I thought I was imagining things. Then again a few days later. It‚Äôs such a short while and only in a small section of the screen. I‚Äôve only caught it happening two times now. First time, the screen was idle on the home screen and the phone was sat on the table, second time it was idle on a web page. Happened on the right side of the screen (around halfway between the top and the middle).

Poking Top Mic with Sim Tray Tool	"Hi,
Me being an idiot poked the *top* microphone of my literally brand-new S22 (base) with the sim tray removal tool. I only realized my mistake after using a very small amount of force.
Is the top mic the same as the bottom mic, designed to be idiot proof?
Edits:
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dQ0X-tO\_E4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dQ0X-tO_E4) Looks like the top mic is actually pretty deep in there, like, you'd have to penetrate the flash in order to get to it.

Are the S22 issues bad enough to wait for the S23?	I keep hearing that the S22 is a bit of a disappointment, especially in the battery department. I‚Äôm an iPhone user looking to switch to Galaxy land sometime soon. Would it be better to wait for the S23, since many are saying it‚Äôs supposed to fix many of the issues the S22 seems to have?	N
I charged it a bit at 79% up to 89% earlier so if I didn't charge it then it would probably be at 38ish%. 6h 4m sot and 5h 56m off at 38ish% is more than good enough for me since I upgraded from a j5 prime.	"https://imgur.com/a/Ol5pCDc

Confused about the notification sound limitations of the S22 Ultra	So is the only way for me to have, for example, discord to make it's new message notification sound, which is heard on desktop and iphones, to go deep into the notification settings of the app, and set a custom sound that I've downloaded to it? I'm annoyed that every single sound from the phone is just the default notification noise, but it also seems like it wants me to do way more to change that up. It seemed like people were confused about it when I googled it, but none of what I read answered my question specifically. Am I missing something, or is this a common problem?	N

Is S22 Ultra a difficult phone to use coming from an 8 year iPhone user?	"Hey everyone. I am heavily entrenched in the Apple ecosystem with an iPhone 11 Pro Max, iPad Pro 12.9 M1, AW S4 and ATV 4K. I have only used iPhones since 2013 coming from iPhone 5s but I am really bored with iOS nowadays and was looking for something fresh and bought the S22 Ultra 5G Phantom White 12GB RAM and 256gb storage. I will be getting the phone in 2 days. 
I have been looking through several YouTube videos and I am seeing S22 Ultra has convoluted series of menus in every app. There is a settings page inside an app and there are universal settings as well and each drawer has multiple toggles and all of this seems kind of overwhelming. Even removing the S Pencil launches a pop up with 8 options. 
My concern is whether s22 ultra is easy to use? Or will there be a learning curve involved? Would it be difficult for me coming from iPhone 11 Pro Max? Or should I just get the 13 pro max?"	N

S22 ultra Bluetooth car audio issues	I have 2 cars 2014 Acura TL, and 2012 Lexus RX 350. I have had Samsung phones paired with these 2 devices for the past few years including 10 plus recently.

The s22 ultra thinks it is playing the music no sound comes out of car speakers, sometimes I hear static.BTW,I have Galaxy buds and I can listen to music via Bluetooth from s22 ultra.Don't tell me to report the problem to Honda and Toyota as these cars were made 10 years back.

There are too MANY duplicates, triplicates and MORE of literally the exact same subject.

Samsung should either post the information these users are seeking or the moderators should more alert and delete redundant posts instead of deleting harmless banter.I'm going back to my vacation from helping others out.

Info on June Update for S22 Models	This article was published on June 20th regarding US S22 users, so not very many people in the US have received their June update yet.

Does your Galaxy device store logs of every wifi network it's discovered?	My friend had their new Jeep Cherokee stolen last night. My guess is the jeep was hacked using the vehicles WiFi. If this were the case, whoever hacked it must have been using a mobile wifi/hotspot to discover the vehicles WiFi, which means anyone's phone within range of that mobile Hotspot must have picked up that IP/Host. And I'm wondering if there's a way to go into your phone to see all the nearby networks your phone has connected to in the last 24 hours. If there's a way we can find the IP address, we could give that to the police. Any help would be greatly appreciated!	N

What‚Äôs new features will be in One UI 5.0 and What should be?	Samsung's One UI 5.0 could be a game-changer skin when compared to all Android skins.TheGalaxy S21, S21+,andS21 Ultrawere the first receiver, and then it was gifted to theGalaxy Z series.Samsungoften does rigorous testing before releasing the stable version with the Android system.This time will be no exception as OneUI is the USP-Unique Selling Proposition of the Korean giant.One UIwithAndroid 9 pie,Since its release after the announcement at Samsung‚Äôs developer conference in 2018 and unveiled in Galaxy Unpacked in February 2019, Samsung has come a long way fromOne Ui 1.0toOne UI 4.0focuses on customization, privacy, and access toSamsung'secosystem.LaterOne UI 4.1and a special version for foldable 4.1.1 will release after this month.Following the path,One UI 5.0is said to be under development and would have a lot to offer.We will discuss what new features will add to it and, of course, how the security 7 privacy will improve. There is also one catch,Samsung'secosystem, which consists of native apps and payments services. Samsunghas been recently integrating its payment apps to grab on to their customers so that they don‚Äôt want to switch as they get comfortable.According to the sources,One UI 5.0will be out with a beta program in July-August this year and is expected to launch as a stable version in the last Q3 of 2022. This will follow the same pattern of being released yearly a new version.	N

Galaxy S22 heat issues	I got this phone a month ago, and even from the beginning I felt something was not okay. The phone heats up whenever I'm using it and its a bit unusual since I'm coming from a s8+ which in theory should be worse when it comes to heat. But in my case not at al this s22 heats up even when I'm just regulary using it, after about 30 minutes of on screen time the heat gets to a pont when it is unconfortable to hold the phone, when I use the camera, top back of the phone gets not warm but hot, I tried some games as soon as i boot into a game the phone has allready started heating. I've read some articles and forums stating that this phone does not have the best cooling solution but from what I've seen and read it shouldn't be even near what I'm experiencing.	N

Exclusive: Galaxy S22 One UI 5.0 beta launches third week of July, set for October release	[https://www.sammobile.com/news/exclusive-galaxy-s22-one-ui-5-0-beta-launches-third-week-july-october-release/](https://www.sammobile.com/news/exclusive-galaxy-s22-one-ui-5-0-beta-launches-third-week-july-october-release/)	N
Did anybody's connection icons change with the June 2022 update? My icon used to just show LTE+	"Just looking to see if anybody else noticed their connection icons having changed with the latest update. I have an unlocked model of the S22 Ultra and prior to the update, it would either say LTE or LTE+. Now it just displays 4G with LTE running down the right side... I dunno if this is now mimicking the connection graphics that carrier locked phones are using?

Samsung Wallet update just arrived on my UK phone	"Just updated Samsung pay to Samsung wallet here in UK.
Can anyone tell me if anything has materially changed? My understanding is that it's now just Pass and Pay in a single app?
I currently use Bitwarden as I can use that on computer also but the integration on phone isn't as seamless as I'd like. Having no access to logins on a computer if using Samsung pass is a show stopper for me.
I'm interested to hear if anyone uses Samsung pass and how they manage on PC."	N
Anyone on S22 getting pink artifacting/glitching?	"I get this pink static like lines on random parts of the screen when playing videos on some sites or trying to set a GIF as a lockscreen wallpaper. Is this just me or is it a software issue?

Recommended fast charger for S22 Ultra?	"I am finally upgrading from the S9+ to an unlocked S22 Ultra for T-Mobile. I have ordered my case and my headphone dongle, and now I need to figure out my fast charger.

I ordered the Galaxy S22 and now I'm having some second thoughts	"I've heard that the battery life is terrible and the speakers are not that good and that the phone overheats when gaming. 
I don't use my phone that much that the battery life would be too big of a problem but I do play Pokemon Go and Runescape occasionally and I wonder if it drains the battery too fast and overheats the phone while playing especially Pokemon go? I've been wondering how the phone runs these two games?
So now I'm thinking about canceling the order. 800‚Ç¨ is quite a lot for a phone that has such big problems."	N
Call me a clout chaser, but it really bugs me how people immediately notice iPhone's trademark rear camera module and still not recognise the Galaxy S22 camera module.

s22 ultra no longer has WiFi calling	"My unlocked s22 ultra updated with the June update today, and now all wifi calling options are missing. I've rebooted the phone twice, and it's still not in the phone options. 
Normally I wouldn't care, but T-Mobile is having cellular issues in my area and it would be helpful to go wifi only to stay connected. Anyone else with an unlocked s22 notice the same thing?
I tried posting in the Samsung sub as well, but they won't accept they post....
Edit - I found the issue. My carrier configuration version is at 0.0.0 and won't update. I have to force my phone to 2g or I have no signal. I'm using esim if that matters."	N
S22 has more written negative reviews than actual video reviews and benchmarks	"A lot of the stuff I've been reading about S22 are mostly negative, especially the battery life. But when I go to watch a video review and benchmarks, they seem to be quite good. Surely they can't *all* be sponsored by Samsung.
So what is going on? Are people's expectations really that high? We're not yet at a generational leap as it was in the case of S7 vs. S8, so you can't expect huge improvements. There is speculation that S24 will do that.
I'm trying to decide if I want to buy an S22+ but reading all these negative reviews makes me think the battery is just as bad as my 4 year old S8. But if I sum up all the videos I've watched, it seems to be doing quite well under normal daily use, not intensive gaming or photography."	N
s21 Fe vs s22	Was looking to decide between the two, which phone do you think would be the better purchase, s21 Fe is about 200$ cheaper, but wasn't too sure which would be the better purchase. Both North American versions. Any help is appreciated thanks	N

Older Charger for S22	My wife just got a new S22. Will her S10e charger be OK to charge her phone? I know it would not be as fast, but that doesn't matter.Can someone point me to which chargers are safe and unsafe for the S22 line?Thanks!	N
Text and call notifications	On my Galaxy S9 I had a notification light telling me that I had a new text or phone call, and when I went to pick it up it would vibrate. My S22 does neither. I have to actually pick it up and open the screen to see if I have any new texts which is pretty inconvenient. I don't want to have to turn my screen on every time I step out of the room to see if I received a notification while I was gone. I read online that there's an app called aodNotify that brings back the notification light,but after I installed it, it needed several permissions to work which made me uncomfortable. Any suggestions?	N
180 degree Flip not working anymore	Hey Samsung Team,Please enable that feature again, it is adding to stress when I am driving and wanting to still look at navigation but with low battery. I had to plug in the charging cable which makes it impossible to use in protrait mode and hence had to force use it in upside down. Up until all previous models by Samsung this was allowed but now it is turned off due to someone did not like it on there fold 3. Please add a toggle option for users like me who still want to use that essential feature. Please reinstate with a settings optional for each user.	N

Always On Display: Show Music Information	"Hi All,
I just picked up a new Galaxy S22 Ultra, and so far, I love it. I watched a few videos on settings and best things to enable and found some conflicting information regarding the AOD setting ""Show Music Information."" Some Youtube videos claimed this feature showed information on nearby music (like the Pixel feature.) However, in my experience, it only shows music that is playing on the device itself
I was hoping some galaxy experts could clarify how that works, or if there is any ability to do this in the OneUI vs. installing something like Shazam (which is owned by apple and probably short-lived for android)"	N

Annoying fingerprint sensor position on Samsung S22 phones	"Been using an S22 Ultra for several days, in addition to my old Huawei P30 Pro with a dying battery.
I still have trouble aiming for the fingerprint sensor - because it's at ~25% of the phone's height, so I usually aim below it, and the phone doesn't show the sensor if you tap the screen in the wrong location. [Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhOISbuo4nw).
On the Huawei, the fingerprint sensor is simply at the base of the screen; can't miss it. But even if you do, the phone shows immediately where it is.
Can I do anything to make unlocking easier, both phone-in-hand and phone-on-desk? I don't want to use face unlock, and this is an annoying enough problem that combined with the poor battery life, excessively large phone size,  the [Google Photos sync idiocy](https://www.xda-developers.com/android-11-google-photos-trash-fix/), [stupid large quick settings](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/qdn4wi/android_12s_quick_settings_bar_is_a_huge_step/), [questionable camera quality vs. the 5x optical zoom P30 Pro](https://www.reddit.com/r/S22Ultra/comments/vlqev1/surprisingly_bad_indoor_photos_of_documents_vs/) and other Samsung and Android 12 annoyances, makes me want to stick with the P30 Pro and carry a portable battery around."

Lost S22	"Hey ya'll. About 2 weeks ago, some one accidentally lost their S22 at my work. I work at a small truck stop off the highway that gets a TON of random traffic from people stopping to get gas, food, use the rental showers, or staying over night at the motel. We made several attempts to find the owner of the phone, even contacting the police but after 2 weeks we were unsuccessful.

Is this right? $800 S22 Ultra? No trade in? I'm confused and lacking trust LOL	"I'm being forced to upgrade from Sprint LG v40. I'm going with S22 Ultra 512GB.
I'm thinking TMO or unlocked. But trying to save $$$. But getting confused about how much I'm *really* paying in the end!
\-----------------------------------------------------------------
FYI, my v40 is well past the original 18 month lease payment plan with Sprint. I also paid a remaining balance of \~$90 to own the phone outright. Also, TMO website says ""*eligible customers on active lease agreements must turn in their device*."" But that's not me. **So, offer can't be redeemed by me? Or it does, but I just don't need to trade-in anything?**
\-----------------------------------------------------------------
**Amazon Unlocked: $1,149.99**
**TMO website: $1,399.99 - $600 upgrade offer = $800 (\~$33/month, 24 months)**
\-----------------------------------------------------------------
TMO website listed original monthly payment of $58. But after $25 monthly credits, it goes down to $33/month.
But...at checkout, the installment agreement contract shows amount financed as $1,399 and original $58/month. No credits/lower price mentioned! **Is this just the website not updating the agreement/contract?!!!? Or slight of hand to hide real price is actually full price? Am I missing something?**
\-----------------------------------------------------------------
Also, if the phone is really $800, **can I just bypass the $33/month and pay $800 outright to own it early on? Or will they force me to pay $1,399 to own since I'm skipping the 24 months and credits?**
\-----------------------------------------------------------------
At this point I could either save big ($600) by getting thru TMO. Or if it's all really full price, then might as well get Amazon unlocked and save less ($250).

S22 not responding to screen taps	My wife's S22 and my S22 ultra often don't respond to a single finger tap to navigate, initiate an action or enter a response. It can be dangerous when operating a vehicle using my phone as a gps. But now I think the root cause it's related to the quality of service. I have poor signal quality at my home so I've been trying different signal boosters. I notice better signal quality gives better screen response to taps of my finger. I have had poor signal quality for 16 years and many different brands of phones but I've never had a problem with the touchscreen not responding properly. I turned in an error report and Samsung says they know about the issue. I hope they prioritize user input when the phone gets busy looking for signal. It will lead to less distractions while operating a vehicle and less frustration while using their flagship phone. I would think the screen working properly would be top priority when releasing new hardware/software	N

Do y'all have any tips? Using a S22+"	N
Galaxy Z Flip 3 or Galaxy S22?	"So I‚Äôm looking to get a Samsung and was debating between these two. I currently have an iPhone 13 Pro Max and will continue to use that as my daily but wanted another phone for work as I tend to use a lot more android apps for that. Initially I had the flip 3 but after seeing the poor battery life and less than impressive camera as well potential screen issues, I started looking at the galaxy s22. I checked both today in the store and they do feel nice on my hand.
Am I right in thinking the s22 is literally same as s22+ but smaller screen size?"	N
I have a S22 base, and I want to try a samsung VR headset, any recommendations?		N
The haptics get much better after June update	"Previous it was so bad I turned off the vibration for gestures. It was cheap feeling and sluggish to animations. Now the haptics are tighter shorter and quicker when using keyboard. Very pleasant to use. 
And for gestures it is better too. 
Great work! I enjoy typing again."	N
lost super fast charging	I used to have super fast charging with my 36W Aukey quick charger but after the June update it's only showing fast charging. anyone else noticing a change? is this to boost sales of the 45W charger?	N
S22 Ultra Not Connecting to AT&amp;T 5G	"Here's my issue, will try to summarize best I can with the hope that someone can help.
* Phone: S22 Ultra Unlocked USA Version
* Carrier: AT&amp;T Prepaid - Unlimited Max plan with 5G
* Location: without giving away exact location, I'm in Central NY state, both my home and work areas have been part of this test (1 hour commute)
* AT&amp;T Coverage Map: The map, filtered for AT&amp;T Prepaid, clearly shows 5G
* SIM: I had an old sim that was replaced with a 5G sim about 6 weeks ago by the local store
* Issue: I never get anything more than LTE+
* The link below shows the speed test done with AT&amp;T support which shows 4G speeds. The link also includes results of \*#0011# and \*#\*#4636#\*#\*
* Just to be clear: I've never connected to 5G since I only recently upgraded to the 5G plan and got the new SIM.
I've talked to support three times now. They have done things like updating IMEI at their end, resetting the connection from their end, having me reset my connection in phone settings, reboot a couple of times, try to manually pick network provider. I asked the last support person if he can check at his end if my area is really getting 5G or if someone updated the coverage map too early and his response was ""geolink"" is down so he can't check. I'll probably end up going to a store to see if they can figure this out but I'm hoping there are other ideas here that I can try. Thanks in advance.

just got the s22 ultra today and now wanting more storage	"I just received the phone today, I got it from Samsung on a trade in deal (havnt sent in the trade in yet) where I only had to pay $75. I'm realizing that 128 gb is not going to be enough storage. Does Samsung offer a way to upgrade the same model phone to get more storage? I don't see a way to do it through trade in. I looked at returning it but they are no longer running the same deal and would have to pay an additional $100 on top of the $100 difference in models.
Just seeing if there was a way I could trade it in and pay $100 to upgrade to the 256gb model."	N
Which should I choose? S22+ or S22U?	"I have to pick one of these phones the difference in price is not a factor since I won't be paying for it my employer will.
I prefer the smaller size of the S22+ but I like the better camera of the S22 Ultra. I will not use the stylus.
I will not be owning the phone so trade in value in the future doesn't matter either."	N

Call pop-up on lock screen	I have a galaxy s22 ultra phone. I am just wondering if there is a way to disable a call pop-up or brief notification from showing up when receiving a call from the lock screen.

Holy crap it was AOD this whole time	"Welp, I turned off Always on Display. To my knowledge, I was never even using it. It must have been running dimly all night (which may explain the 20% battery drain while not in use). I was getting 4-5 hours of SOT for the last few months. Today I'm on track to 10 hours of SOT. 
I have a replacement unit coming tomorrow evening from my wireless carrier. I'm going to hold off on the swap for another couples of days. If these numbers keep, I'm going to send the replacement back.
Edit: S22 Ultra SD Verizon
Edit 2: It was on tap to show since so many are asking
Edit 3: I'm telling you all, I had (what I consider) unacceptable battery life for months until I turned off AOD today. Look at me now (no other change in daily use): https://i.imgur.com/TYKfrqj.jpg
Edit 4: Still on track for a 10 hour SOT. Bixby just kicked into my nighttime power save routine. I'd typically be at about 25% battery right now, but I'm still going strong. Looking forward to my next few days, hoping things stay this way https://i.imgur.com/VMRiemV.jpg"	N

Switching between apps while gaming in landscap mode is aweful.	"I somehow keep accidently ""swipping"" my game off therefor closing it when I'm switching in between game apps in landscape to/from other apps while rotating phone to portrait.
It's frustrating. Can I somehow change that to a button instead? Maybe turn off something?
I come from a OnePlus 3t ( as if that matters). I nearly regret buying this s22. Not just because of this but theres a lot of touch/screen related things I dont like."	N
Gaming Question, FGO on S22?	Hi so I was wondering about the performance of FGO on the S22. I've heard that FGO had issues running on S20 so I was wondering if the newer Galaxy phone still struggle with FGO. I have an S8 still and it run FGO just fine, but the phone is getting pretty old and I'm trying to plan ahead.	N
Voice Mail App	I've been using phone S22 Ultra Unlocked not even notice that Voice Mail App is missing. I had one with s21 Ultra. I'm on US Mobile and they don't provide own App but Samsung had their own basic app. Did they removed it with new OS update ?	N
Regain the promissed, or rather expected, performance	"As it has been documented, GoS pretty much kills the performance on these devices. I personally find it unacceptable, as my Note20 Ultra outperforms my stock S22 Ultra. Anyway, disabling GoS is not enough, Samsung has another way of throttling the performance, in the name of Smart FPS Adjuster. You'll have to disable that one as well. Since I don't trust that button under Game Booster, I prefer to just disable everything through adb:
pm disable-user com.samsung.android.game.gametools
pm disable-user com.samsung.android.game.gos
pm disable-user com.sec.android.smartfpsadjuster
Restart your device afterwards. I'm currently playing Genshin Impact on maximum settings at 2059x960 (Genshin defaults to this if your screen res is set to 1440p) resolution and maintaining between 45-53 fps in combat, one hour in. This is something I can accept from this device, and during summer - ain't too bad for an Exynos, right?
One thing I should add is that now Genshin is no longer limited to 60Hz, rather the screen takes advantage of its dynamic refresh rate - it mostly sits pinned to 120Hz, with the occasional 24Hz during loading screens. This is good, even on a 60fps limited game as it drastically reduces the input lag. This is due to the fact that Samsung can no longer apply its own ""profiles"" to your games, rather Android just runs everything and expects the SoC to handle the throttling - as it should on a premium device!
For reference, stock my S22 Ultra runs Genshin at a pitiful 1321x616 resolution, and gets anywhere between 22 and 35FPS 10 minutes into the game.
If you want to reenable those applications just run these commands (or format your phone, either works):
pm enable com.samsung.android.game.gametools
pm enable com.samsung.android.game.gos
pm enable com.sec.android.smartfpsadjuster"	N
For those of you with a S22 Ultra Unlocked with voice and Samsung Account issues, does your IMEI settings show that the MEID and MIN are Unknown?	"I noticed that when I'm having issues that if I look in my IMEI settings (Settings -&gt; About Phone -&gt; Status Information -&gt; IMEI information) that the MEID and MIN aren't set when I have issues. The MEID is definitely causing the Samsung Account problem as I have seen a toast to that effect. The MIN might explain the voice issues as it is used to identify the phone within the cell network.
[https://imgur.com/a/9TOilji](https://imgur.com/a/9TOilji)
The odd thing is that I have a second SIM in my phone which I have off by default (as it is an Australian SIM) but if I turn it on and it connects with roaming to T-Mobile (and then I turn it off again) somehow these values get set and both issues go away."	N
$250 Credit expired	"I thought my $250 credit expired at the end of the month and went to use it today. It turns out it expired on the 24th.  Has anyone ever managed to get one extended?  If so, how did you go about requesting/getting it done?
Thank you."	N
The S22 series (base and plus, at least) have a different, wider, aspect ratio than the S21 and S21+.	"I never see this mentioned anywhere, either on Reddit or YouTube, but the screens on the base model S22 and the S22+ have a wider aspect ratio than last year's S21 and S21+. From 20:9 to 19.5:9. That doesn't seem like a lot, but the first thing I noticed when I picked up my S22+ was how much wider it was. It's the same aspect ratio as an iPhone, just a little smaller than the Pro Max. I've always been a little put off by the narrower ratio on Android phones, so it's nice to see this year's models have that more premium feel to them. 
Just wanted to point that out because, as I said, almost nobody mentions it. I had no idea until I actually unboxed the phone, felt the difference, and then Googled it to make sure I wasn't just going nuts. 
I'm curious though: do you guys like the wider ratio?"	N
If S22U have bad battery life, how much bad battery life is basic S22 model?	S22U have obviously 5-8 sot. How much have basic S22 sot? Like s10e?	N
S22+ battery life.	"I posted an image recently (since deleted) of my battery and device care screen and people were giving me grief (rightfully so, it turns out) because I didn't click on the graph and show the screen that tells what apps you were using and stuff. So I did another full to dead (well, 4%) battery test and grabbed a screeny of that page to share. A lot of people hate on the S22 series for poor battery life, but I'm not mad at all.
[Here's the screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/tWg306L.jpg)
Over eight hours of screen on time, and a full freaking day of screen off. Today is Thursday at 5:12pm; I took the phone off charge at 100% on Wednesday morning, around 8:30am. I wasn't playing intense games or anything, but I logged a fair bit of YouTube Shorts and TikTok (at the end I was binging TikTok just to kill the battery down to single digits; browsing Boost wasn't doing it fast enough lol).
If I'd skipped the video binging I could have easily got 10 or 11 hours of SoT out of this phone. Easily.
So...YMMV of course, and I don't really game on my phone, but here's what I got. I've had the phone for like 4 days too, so it hasn't really had time to learn my usage patterns yet. I imagine it's only gonna get better.
Thanks for coming to my TED talk heh.
EDIT: I should add I'm in North America, using the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 CPU."	N
Samsung S22 ultra	Do u think the price is going to decrease by September? Or better deal on it?	N
S22 Ultra SD Unlocked Battery drain	"S22 Ultra SD Unlocked Battery
So I recently upgraded to the S22 Ultra from the pixel 6 pro. I've had the device for about a month. However, I feel like this battery will die insanely fast. For example. This morning I woke up, took phone off charger, showered, relaxed a bit, got into my car, connected to BT and drove 17 minutes to work and my battery drained 10%. SOT of 2 mins. 10% drained seems insane and to me 
Another example. I got home after work and my phone died with 3 hours SOT. So I charged it, and turned it on and watched a 13 minute YouTube video. My battery has drained 9% already with a SOT of 18 minutes. 
What am I doing wrong here? I have dark mode on, FHD 120hz, mostly all apps in deep sleep and even followed an XDA post on how to save battery. My phone is officially at 86% now after typing this out. Is my battery defective? I recently factory reset my device because I thought I screwed up by doing Smart switch. This time I didn't do that and denied to use it. How long does it take for adaptive battery to start working? I got myself a Tab S8+ and that things battery is crazy good even before it's optimized my apps. I expect to at least get 6+ hours of SOT on an average day if I'm just listening to music and occasionally browsing the Internet. 
Any tips would be awesome! I love this phone so much but the battery is killing me lol."	N
S22 Shutter priority.	Now I'm totally unsure if there is a reason that this isn't a feature but why doesn't samsung have a "prioritise faster shooting" setting built into the camera app. I mean surley having a setting to increase the shutter speed (similar to IOS) would be the obvious solution to the infamous shutter lag. Everything else about the s22 is superb besides shutter lag.	N
Will samsung every fix the s22 series ?	By this I mean fixing the God awful software optimization . Coming from a s21 ultra which was almost flawless when it came to performance my s22+ feels slow and buggy with overheating and lag occurring on a daily basis. This is genuinely unacceptable and other then this the phone is amazing and genuinely and upgrade from my s21 ultra IMO.	N

Universal backups between phones.	"The question is if I were to take my iPhone copy all the data to my s21. Create an encrypted back up using smart switch.  
Would I be able to use that back up when setting up my s22u that is arriving tomorrow.  
The main reason is I feel like using smart switch to copy data over creates issues when copying from iPhone to Samsung. I want the quickest setup of the s22.  
Otherwise I was going to do the smart switch copy iPhone data over to s22u. Create an encrypted backup up on my PC. Factory reset the s22u and restore the back up. That's what I had to do the first time I got this phone to work out battery issues and other bugs."	N

I've had an S22 from the start and there's never been any notifications that a new version of the software is available (security update/improvements etc). 
Once a month I do a manual check and then I'm able to download the update.  
I have the auto download over wi-fi option selected.  
Presumably it should tell me there's an update waiting? 
Thanks in advance"	N
What kind of Warranty should I get for my S22 Plus? Is Samsung Care+ or SquareTrade good?	I think I just have bad luck, because my previous phone, a Galaxy S20 FE just bent and stopped working. I was generally careful with the device, always holding it witrh a tight grip and not dropping it and not damaging the device in any way. I really want to get warranty for the device in case I have problems like that despite my best efforts. I have heard some bad things about Samsung Care+ about on reddit and don't feel very confident about SquareTrade.	N

Deciding on whether I should switch permanently.	I came over from a 13 pro max,which came after many samsung flagships throught the years,starting with an S3. I just got the phone and not gonna lie,I'm shocked at how unbaked some things are. The battery is so bad I'm convinced my unit is just faulty and the UI is such a miss. It's no touchwiz anymore and that's awesome,massive improvements from OneUI 1 even,but c'mon. It's the little things for me. Your own emojis aren't used in the "messages" app. The in call indicator(the one next to the time) only appears on certain apps and it's tiny. Its a lot of small stuff like this that I just cant get over. Why do you name your apps like "samsung notes" when I am using a Samsung phone and it's the app that comes with it? Why is the clipboard thingy(the menu with copy and paste you get when you select text) still some ugly android 8 rectangle? Why can't face unlock be used with Wallet when it clearly can't be fooled by an image of me?(I've tested it) I get it that Samsung does not control every aspect of their phones and they will never be polished as iphones and it's more about control but I'm just curious if I'm the only one who's nitpicking or are these things that bother everyone? A lot of things they've improved on but god,there's so much more to polish.	N

which case to get for s22 and watch 4	"Hi reddit, so i got my samsung s22 ultra on Saturday, and i am more happy than ever. It's very big upgrade for me from a cheap $100 Xiaomi, which i use without any protection since 4 years...
For s22's screen i used Samsung's screen protector just to avoid any fingerprint issues.
For case, i thinking of either going with ""Samsung's silicon stap case"" or ""Spigen Tough Armor Back Cover Case."" Unable to make any choice. If somebody can help me. Also, how does they handle heating. Like playing games or something, like video editing. Idk...
For watch, i am thinking of ordering ""Spigen Screen Protector for Galaxy Watch 4 44mm"" and ""Spigen Liquid Air Cover Case"". I was uncertain if i should get a case for the watch. But while travelling especially in public transport it's needed. So, i just thought let's get one. But i am not sure about how it will handle the water/moisture. Especially when/after cleaning my hands. If it gets trapped inside(between watch and the case) then it's an issue right? 
Also, guide me on cleaning and if it's fine to remove the case often for cleaning. Especially, s22's since watch's more harder...
Thanks..."	N

"Now Playing" port from the Pixel	"As I upgraded from a Google Pixel 2XL to the S22 Ultra, I tried to make my phone look and feel as closely as the Pixel (I'm still a Google Pixel fan) and 1 of the missing things for me was ""Now Playing"" that can auto recognize songs played around you even when in airplane mode and never needing to open Shazam or anything.   
Finally, this feature is ported! it's currently not that easy to install, but it is working really well on my S22 currently and I love it, no root required so you can try without any danger, note that I didn't notice any significant battery drain or anything as well but I only used it for a couple of days.

I WISH I NEVER TRADED MY S21 ULTRA	"I know I'm gonna get a lot of hate but I'll just speak my mind. 
I wasn't gonna upgrade to the S22 ultra AT ALL but the deals were insane. I could get the S22 ultra for 75 dollars if I traded in my S21 ultra. No way I couldn't take that. After all it's supposed to be an upgrade right?
When I first got this phone animations were horrendous. So bad you could barely use it. Maybe it's because I got the base model 128/8gb whereas the S21 ultra has 12gb but that doesn't make any sense. Gesture navigations are pretty bad on One Ui specially with One Ui 4 but this one was WORSE. 
Thankfully the june update fixed most of the jittery issues I had
Another issue that annoyed me so much with this device was the camera. The camera experience is so bad it's irritating.
Idk if it's my device but after taking a picture the viewfinder lags making it impossible to take another photo in quick succession Never had this issue with the S21 ultra * Second when recording a video that has a lot of motion like a sporting event or games the video drops frames constantly to like 5fps at times. Changing video size doesn't help and turning auto fps off doesn't help either *ALSO I NEVER HAD THIS ISSUE WITH THE S21 ULTRA **
Snapchat optimization which was supposed to be an improvement is total shit. You can switch between lenses but that's about it. The video experience is so jittery and the same issues i have with framerate happens with Snapchat too
The only upgrade I can see is the design and Spen that's all. 
I really hope Samsung can fix this cause this is really ruining the experience. I can't imagine iPhone users switching to this and keeping it. 
Keep in mind this is coming from a Galaxy knight who has owned Samsung phones since the S4 and is completely doused in Samsung's ecosystem. I love Samsung they just need to do better

Question related to battery usage of camera	I‚Äôve recently bought Samsung s22 ultra on EOFY sale, 1750 AUD (~1193 USD) for the 12gb ram 512gb storage. The phone has been great to use, a little difficult to navigate coz I‚Äôve switched from an iPhone XR so that‚Äôs on me. But the battery health is bothering me a little bit, specially when I use the camera. For every minute I use the camera for normal photo taking, approx. 1% charge is getting vanished. Is this normal or is it an issue? Because the battery drain was much less for camera in my iPhone which was 3 years old with 81% battery health. Do I need to contact Samsung or does it get better or is it normal?	N
What's a good keyboard?	"I really don't like the keyboard. Sometimes when I type it.puts.a . between words instead of a space. I think the space bar shrinks sometimes.
Also, if I type a word and it's misspelled on the first letter, it doesn't suggest the obvious word I had intended because the first letter isn't correct. Is this just something annoying to put up with or are there better keyboards out there than the stock one?"	N

I tested it and put the phone on my desk with an alarm for a minute later... I did not even notice it was vibrating for a couple minutes until I looked at it.

S22+ Battery	"Hi guys, I read quite a few post about battery life on the S22 series so i'm wondering if my device is good to go or should I do a factory reset.

regular s21 a good enough phone?	"I just wanna take selfies that don't suck, and maybe eventually post it on instagram stories (and maybe cool if my videos don't look like were recorded with a potato).
a galaxy s21 literally costs half of a standard iphone 13 in my country. that's too big a difference. I can afford both, yes, but I wonder if the extra bucks are worth it (u$410 x u$950).
I hate iOS, but learned to cope with it. coming from a iphone xs, which feels worse than my former galaxy s9 (except for selfies and social media, which is basically the main point for me). not a gamer."	N
Method to Intentionally Heat Up Phone	"This sounds weird, but I need a surefire method to heat up my phone quickly doing normal tasks (no games or rendering).

I've only noticed the heat when it warms up my hand uncomfortably while scrolling reddit, twitter, youtube, or spotify in the background (I know reddit official mobile app is shite but heating happens elsewhere too). A technician is coming to my home in two days.

Has anyone else had issues enabling 4G Calling/VoLTE?	"For context, I'm in the UK with an unlocked Exynos base S22 256gb that I bought direct from Samsung UK, and my provider is Vodafone.
I imported all my data and settings from my S20 through Smart Switch, but cannot for the life of me get the phone to even show the 4G Calling toggle in the settings app. I've gone to the right place (Settings -&gt; Connections -&gt; Mobile Networks) but have looked elsewhere as well, just in case.
WiFi calling works although maybe doesn't connect as often as I would like. It might be worth noting that Vodafone enables WiFi calling and 4g calling together so you can't enable one without the other from their end.
I contacted vodafone and they did all they could on their end. They disabled and re-enabled WiFi &amp; 4g calling several times, and reset my SIM a couple times as well.
I was originally on an eSim, but set up a different eSim, then switched back to a physical SIM which I am using currently. I have tried putting different people's Sims (including from different networks) in my phone but the toggle still doesn't show. I have also reset my network settings.
Still no luck as of yet.
Samsung Support are useless, mainly telling me to just enable it in the settings, and have nothing to add when I tell them there is no toggle showing at all.
My current next steps are:
1. Reset all settings
2. Full factory reset
3. Send the phone to Samsung for a replacement.
Each of these is more of a PITA than the last so I want to do as little as possible to fix the problem. Resetting all settings isn't the end of the world, but factory resetting is annoying and I will be so pissed off if I factory reset and it's still not working lol.
Replacing the phone is even worse as I would have to reset my old S20, transfer everything back to it, then do the same again when I receive the replacement a couple weeks later.
That's why I'm wondering if anyone else has had this issue (especially in the UK, and a Vodafone customer is even better), and what it was that solved it, if anything?
I have seen people in here say that importing from Smart Switch can cause issues and was wondering if this might be related, and if I need to do a full factory reset or can just reset the settings for this? I also wanted to know if I have to import everything manually or just apps and settings?
Any help would be much appreciated!"	N
Widevine L1 became L3?	"After the recent June update my base S22 SD isn't giving me HD video on any of the OTT apps, in fact Netflix clearly shows DRM certification as Widevine L3 and maximum playback resolution of SD and HDR capabilities as None.

Please help if anyone knows how to fix, I've restarted my phone, updated the apps through galaxy store as mentioned on Samsung forums. Hasn't worked.

Want an S22 but very worried about battery life	Hey y‚Äôall, so I have an iPhone 13 Pro Max and it‚Äôs alright. But I‚Äôm honestly so tired of the big screen, IOS, and just being in the apple eco system in general. Overall, I want a small phone. The Pixel 6 is what kind of got me looking at android phones but I found it to be a little bigger than I wanted - with only 2 cameras. I really don‚Äôt want to sacrifice anything too major. However, when at Best Buy, I sorta fell in love with the S22. The form factor is fantastic, it fits in my hand nearly perfectly, I don‚Äôt have to sacrifice a camera, the screen is very nice, and it‚Äôs an all around nice look device. I almost pulled the trigger but I started googling the phone and I just found endless amounts of battery life stories. So I thought I‚Äôd just ask you guys who actually have the phone whether or not it‚Äôs worth the jump. I‚Äôm a teacher who‚Äôs phone stays in my pocket for about 80% of the work day but when I get home, it‚Äôs a lot of Tik Tok, YouTube, Twitter, and Reddit scrolling - almost never any gaming. I‚Äôm on summer break right now, which means my phone is in my hand almost all day‚Ä¶ which I am trying to cut back on. Thoughts?	N

Help me decide...	"HI,
I have been planning to buy a s22 ultra for sometime, I absolutely love how it looks from it's screen size,back design, customization we can do in it all that awesome stuff. I need a phone for working gaming and browsing but I'm hearing/reading bad reviews about it.
For example
1 : it has a bad battery life people are going nuts on this one is it really that bad? Jeez.
2: it lags/stutters a lot. 
3: it heats up whilst doing regular tasks browsing reddit, Twitter etc
4: Snapdragon good exynos bad, don't worry on this one I'll definitely buy a SD variant, still don't get one thing though why Samsung is still making two different chipsets? Why not just make phones with SD chips and stop with this exynos bs?
These are some points that stop me from buying s22u, now I know that no phone is perfect.
I also see a lot of good reviews about it on YouTube and other platforms, that it's the best phone they ever had and it's perfect in almost every aspect, after hearing/seeing these type of reviews I say to myself you know what buy it.
Reviews are mixed and I can't decide whether to buy it or not, because I want to enjoy my new phone and not visit the store every now and then to get it fixed.
So reddit give me the answer I'm looking for to finally lock the decision.
If the answer is buy it.
People who have the s22u please suggest the most stunning-beautiful-awesome color. 
Only suggest official colors and not Samsung exclusive ones because black sides bad.

Second option: NOTE 20 ultra I love the design and all but, here it is only available in exynos so the chances of me buying it are low, there maybe a SD version somewhere but it will be hard to find.
Btw I absolutely love this bronze color of note 20U!

For watch, i am thinking of ordering ""Spigen Screen Protector for Galaxy Watch 4 44mm"" and ""Spigen Liquid Air Cover Case"". I was uncertain if i should get a case for the watch. But while travelling especially in public transport it's needed. So, i just thought let's get one. But i am not sure about how it will handle the water/moisture. Especially when/after cleaning my hands. If it gets trapped inside(between watch and the case) then it's an issue right? 
Also, guide me on cleaning and if it's fine to remove the case often for cleaning. Especially, s22's since watch's more harder...

Which S22 should I get?	"I currently have a Note 9 and got a text from Verizon saying I can get $800 off a new phone if I trade in my old one. I was looking at the S22 series but I dont know which one to get. 
Things that are important to me are low weight and screen resolution but seeing as the Ultra is heavier than my current phone and I already get hand fatigue from it I'm leaning towards the S22+ or even the normal S22.
Is there anything else to consider if I opt for the S22+ or S22? Im not married to the S Pen and I'm willing to use a lower resolution for a lighter phone, I also don't care for the curved screen. I'm going to be playing Wild Rift, CoD Mobile, and Diablo Immortal.
Also is future trade in value a factor?"	N
Galaxy Tab S22 Plus just stopped charging. Am I alone?	"Hi all,
5 week old tablet.  SUCH a nice machine.  But this week it just stopped charging.  Took it to store, they're sending it to samsung to be checked and repaired.  
I've treated it like a baby, but wanted to see if this is common or just a one off?
Thanks!"	N
s22 ultra fast charging	Hi, I've had my s22 ultra for a few weeks and noticed that when I try to fast charge (not super fast charge) it doesn't recognise fast charging? now, I've got fast charging enabled in the settings and when I toggle it on and off nothing happens, the phone recognises super fast charging immediately but not normal fast charging. Its a brand new phone and I've tried 3 different USB c cables and 3 different Samsung fast charging plugs but still nothing. When I tried to see if my portable charger would get the phone to recognise fast charging, the phone does for about 5-10 seconds and then just goes back to 'cable charging' and also to note, when my phone recognises fast charging through my portable charger for about 5 seconds, the time to charge changes from let's say 45 minutes until full to cable charging and 1hr and 10 minutes to charge. I've spoken to someone at Samsung and they said the reason why the phone isn't fast charging is because that's its default charging method? but that doesn't make sense because like I mentioned previously, when try to charge it with my portable charger the time to charge changes and is much quicker until it no longer recognises it and reverts back to cable charging which is quite a bit longer. Has anyone got a solution or is that just the way it is? thanks	N
should I go for the s22 plus?	Cant afford the Ultra	N
just got the s22 plus with buds 2 and..	"This thing is literally the shape of an iphone. Not taking about specs performance or capabilities. Strictly physical design. Why. And even the buds case is airpod like and why are they all white. Thank God I messed up and got the white s22  instead of black. (now the buds themselves which are actually pretty fucking amazing I've had the first buds since they came out but the 2s are amazing. It's like they were hesitant with the 1st gen but full sent it with the 2s).
don't get me wrong it looks good. But our whole thing we're were not like them."	N
Is the S21u battery life better than the S22u? if yes, how much better?	"I can't decide which one i should get. current phone is OnePlus 7 pro. I don't really care about the S pen but i love the rectangular display of the s22u. but if the battery life is horrible like I've seen a lot of people say, it's probably not worth it. 
my main point of conflict is the display and the battery i guess. i want the rectangular display of the s22u but i don't want trash battery life. but for s21 ultra i want good battery life but not the rounded corners display.
so how much better is the s21u battery life and which one should i get?"	N

Reduce screen max brightness.	Hi, so on iOS auto brightness will scale your brightness based on how you set it, like if I'm in full sun I set it to about 3/4 brightness and it uses that to scale to dimmer light areas. Is there a way to do this on the s22 ultra? Or atleast trick it somewhere in the software that instead of my screen being capable of doing it's max 1,750nits brightness it's actually a max of like 1300nits.The screen going full bright mid day is ridiculous in my opinion as I can see just fine with it being alot dimmer and even when I'm inside the auto brightness is pretty bad.Thanks.

Samsung smartphone resolution	I have been enjoying the superb resolution (2560 x 1440) of my Galaxy S8 for several years .

It makes it far less likely that I will buy a Samsung phone in the future. Don't bother telling me that I can get better resolution by buying one of your higher end S22 models.

I moved from iPhone to the SG22 ultra. Lower battery life, 100x better camera, love the pen, just so very happy. So, the worst issue for me is...	I have to restart the phone 4 or more times a day. Home Internet drops, 5g drops, (no lost calls). In places where I should have service, I almost always have to restart to get it. It's getting frustrating.	N
Anyone else have this or just me?	I see amazing photos taken by the phone when I look at reviews and things, but when I actually got the phone and started using it I was kinda disappointed. I got it a few months ago and ever since I have been testing it against my old phone (note 20 ultra). And some things that I have noticed, the night mode that was so advertised on this phone is noticeably worse than the last phone I had. In low light situations it is all right but the darker it gets the more in favor of the note 20 ultra the photos become. This is odd to me as I have seen beautiful night mode shots from reviewers and I don't see why it would be any worse than a previous phone. The second thing is the selfie camera, On paper it should be better, however in practice for both video and photo it seems to fall behind. During the day it isn't as noticeable and sometimes favors the 22. The detail is there but sometimes it just looks off. However, this is amplified when you start going into low light and night situations. It is absolutely abysmal at night compared to the old phone. Single snap is better on the 22 when there is still a good amount of light but still low, but in those conditions night mode makes up for it on the note 20, but ruins the s22. Now on to full on night shots with rear cameras. The s22 ultra is heavily contrasted and doesn't seem to control white balance as well as the old phone. It also favors making the photo brighter rather than balanced or getting realistic looking lighting. There is probably more that I can't remember to post here but I think I have ranted long enough for right now anyway. Am I the only one who has noticed these things? is it just my phone? or was anyone else disappointed when they started testing their new phone?	N
Looking for seamless integration for Samsung Devices, starting with the S22 Ultra...	"Let me preface this by saying I have been, and will always be, an android user for the unforeseeable future, especially one with a Pen.
It has finally become time to retire my beloved 5 year old, what is essentially a paperweight in tech years, Samsung Note8. I was waiting to see if Apple would announce Apple Pencil support for the latest iOS or iPhone 14, being that I am ""that android guy"" in my family but 
* I have a complete lack of desire to get sucked into the Apple Ecosystem, already owning a Tab S6 and Galaxy Watch, as well as Sony, Bose, and various other headphones and Bluetooth accessories.
* I really don't want to have to carry a stylus around when Samsung has damn-near-perfected the integrated one, I use the stylus almost daily as a Project Manager in construction constantly marking up drawings and photos to send out to my contractors. This is partially why I am going S22 Ultra and not Z Fold with an S Pen
* My brother is a complete nerd for Apple and said that since they didn't announce it in the latest iOS update, it will likely not be a thing for many years.
So I have decided to stick with Samsung and obviously lean to the S22 Ultra for my daily needs and already ordered a 512GB model to my local Best Buy for pickup this weekend (I would have gone 1TB but they seem to be sold out of most major \[licensed/trustworthy\] retailers). I come with two major questions and just a third more general one that I am cool with just getting linked to another thread for...
1. Having used SmartSwitch before, is there any other seamless way to transfer data from one Samsung phone to another? It's pretty slow and I have found there is still a lot of cleaning up to do at the end of the switch
2. Is there a way to seamlessly integrate your Samsung Notes, or other sync features, between devices? I would love to take meeting notes on my Tab S6 and have them accessible on my S22 or vice versa.
3. Any suggestions on a good accessories guide? I already have a Spigen case, Cellhelmet liquid glass screen protector, and some of the camera bump/lens protectors
TL;DR: Changing to the S22 Ultra, looking for best data transfer from old phone (also Samsung) to a new phone as well as options/suggestions for syncing data between Samsung devices.

Disable image compression? // worse results then old xiaomi mid range phone	"Hello guys I really need your help,
I just received my new S22 Ultra (256gb, Exynos). I am very disappointed in the cameras performance. Before I had an Xiaomi Mi Note 10 Pro with the same 108mp sensor I think.
I shot alot of photos today to compare both of the cameras and honestly most of the time the old xiaomi looks better :(  Especially in low light situations the samsung is just embarrassingly bad compared to the 2019 mid range phone. The samsungs noise is extreme. 
I realised that the xiaomis pictures have like tripple or 4 times the file size in some cases. Is there any way to disable the compression on the s22 Ultra?
Here is one expamle:
(If you need more please let me know)
I really hope there is just some camera setting I need to change to make it better.. your help is really appreciated! Thanks

Dual sim	Which variant of the S22 ultra has the sim manager. I am trying to use a ESIM and physical Sim at the same time, but I want to split it where one Sim is just for data and the other sim is for phone calls and text. I know the T-Mobile version doesn‚Äôt have that and I can‚Äôt find a specific answer to this question anywhere. Does the unlocked version from Samsung have this feature?	N
