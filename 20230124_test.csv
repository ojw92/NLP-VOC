23,Should I buy the S22+?,"I know the S23 series is right around the corner but I'm honestly underwhelmed.

I think the S21/S22 was peak design. Samsung's camera island was a neat concept that dealt with the issue of growing camera sensors, only for them to ditch it after two generations and replace it with imo a generic-looking alternative. The Galaxy series doesn't look much different to Samsung's midrange line now. Perhaps this is some strategy for Samsung to homogenize their design language but it cheapens the flagship experience (although arguably only the Ultra models are true flagships now). Not to mention, the new camera format offers less protection to the lenses.  

Also, it's been rumoured that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 in the new S23 is an overclocked version from Samsung foundries, not TSMC, which likely means same old thermal throttling/overheating issues. So, it's not as if the S23 line is even offering a better user experience.

Finally, I'm a big fan of white tech. Most of my other devices are all in glorious white. For some it's plain and boring, but I love the simplicity and cleanness of it. It doesn't appear that the S23 models will come in white this year. Samsung have adopted for chewed up bubblegum colours instead.

With that in mind, is it worth buying the S22 Plus at discount?",N,None,2023-01-24 10:44:00,False,False,False,True,False,False,False

31,Samsung ROM via Odin,"Hey guys,



I used to have a S9+ that I bought at my carrier. It came with a lot of bloatware (ZTM rom), so I used Odin to flash the stock Samsung ROM (ZTO) and worked like a charm.

Today I bought a new S22 at the same carrier, and the first thing I did was to flash the ZTO firmware on it, but it didn't work like the last time. I'm still on the ZTM rom after all the process.

Did something change with the new phones or is there something I should've done?
