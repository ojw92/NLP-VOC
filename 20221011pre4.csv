S22 Ultra network and roaming	"Dear all, 
I would like to share with you one topic which stresses me a bit and I would like to know if you guys experience the same or if you have a solution. 
I am traveling a lot and after a flight, when the telephone wansin flight mode and the phone registers for the first time in a new country (UK, Italy, France, Poland) the phone is not able to register automatically in the ""new surrounding"", neither 2G, 3G, 4 or 5G.
The only fix I found is to go to settings, connections, mobile network and switch from ""automatical network search"" to manually, log in manually to a network and resume to automatical again. When logged in once manually, the phone seems to be able to manage itself. 
Maybe someone knows this problem? 
Regards &amp; thanks."	N
Accidentally bend the usb type C tip while charging s22 ultra	Hello everyone, today I was charging my s22 ultra using Samsung 25W charger with Samsung type C to C cable and accidentally sat on the phone (which was lying on the bed). I noticed that the tip of the cable (the aluminium part) got bent slightly. However it still charges the phone (super fast charging). I'm quite paranoid about the fact that this might have damaged the USB type C port of the phone. What do you guys think?? Has anything similar happened to you before?? Are the S22 ultra usb ports durable enough to withstand a force that bends the type C cable?? Also, is it advisable to keep using the same Samsung type C cable as it appears to be charging the phone as of now?? Any insight would be much appreciated..	N

Cloud storage allowing music playback via Samsung Music?	"So, after coming to terms with the new modern world and deciding to get a 100GB cloud storage solution, I was all set to get OneDrive.

So which, if any of the cloud based storage options will basically mimic having an SD card, where I can store my music and have my photos and videos sync to the account?

Is upgrading from an S20+ to S22+ worth it?	"I'm currently paying $40/mo installments for my phone. Paid 1/2 of it so I'm eligible to upgrade to a new phone. The S22+ is $27/mo so I can't see still paying $40 when a newer phone is actually cheaper. 
BUT, here's the hard part...the S20+ has expandable SD storage, 8GB RAM, and I like the phone. Newer phones don't have SD storage, minimal camera upgrades, and less RAM. 
So although I want to upgrade,  I'm having a hard time finding a phone to upgrade to. Anyone have recommendations or suggestions?"	N
Is the S22 Ultra Exynos version worth $700?	"So basically they have the Exynos version on sale (if you get it with a plan) for around 700 USD. Now I know the concensus is that the Exynos version is worse than the Snapdragon.

Love My S22 Ultra, Except...	"I've been a Samsung user for over 10 years and I'm very familiar with the Note style phones and Samsung phones in general.
What I love- Pretty much everything.
What I Dislike- The phone takes a long time to power on and Android takes a while to start as well. Unfortunately, Samsung phones and tablets have been this way for quite a while. I hope Samsung figures something out to make the power up time quicker...maybe even have Android start while the phone is powering up (not sure if that's possible)
What I hate- The battery. Yeah, the battery is ok, but not even good, let alone great. 
Of course I have other petty dislikes, but overall I really enjoy my phone for everything it does. The way my phone works for me makes my life a little easier everyday."	N

Bixby routines question	"Hello
What happens when theres a conflict between two routines.
I have set one routine to turn off super fast charging and turn on battery protect when I'm home (determined by wifi and GPS location).
On weekends, I'm usually out of town. 
I've setup a routine that on weekends,  super fast charging is enabled and battery protect is disabled.
Today is a weekend but I'm not out of town. 
I'm at home. Both the wifi connection I have now and GPS location meet routine 1 criteria. 
When I woke up, both routines were enabled. I know this because both routines appeared in my notifications. 
Suddenly the out of town dissappeared. 
Two questions. 
In the event of a conflict, which presides? 
Second, can I set another routine to mitigate days like today?

Got a Galaxy S22 this week and I love it except for one thing.	"I've been a Galaxy user for a long time. I went from the S5 to the S7 to the S9 and now this week I upgraded to the S22. I love it, it's a nice solid phone, works well, feels familiar. But WHY did they decide to put all the buttons on one side of the phone. This is driving me crazy. The power button and up/down volume are all piled up on the right side while the left side is completely empty. I'm not sure why they changed this from all the previous models of having power on one side and volume on the other.
To take a screenshot you need to press volume down and power at the same time. This used to feel natural and ergonomic in the old models when they were on opposite sides. You could even do it one handed. Now it's awkward and tricky to do and you have to use two hands or try hold the phone on the side. I just don't understand why they made this change. Everything else feels like an improvement but that feels like a step backwards."	N

Wifi issues on brand new S22 Ultra	Just recieved my brand new S22 Ultra and have had it less than 24 hours. I am having horrible wifi issues. The phone is randomly disconnecting and saying "waiting for network quality to improve" while showing a link speed of over 800Mbps. My S21 Ultra which I'm now hesitant to send back for my trade in is connected the whole time and works great on wifi like all my other devices. Slightly farther away (but well within range for all my other devices and old S21) my wifi is dropping and reconnecting constantly causing games like Clash of Clans to be unplayable as you need to reboot the game everytime the network switches.I'm using a wifi 6E band. I saw on reddit that people have posted about connection and wifi issues after the last update so I'm curious if the most recent update broke something and it will get fixed? Or if I need to get a refund for this phone and send it back. Wifi not working is certainly a deal breaker for me.	N

Using an Indian bought S22 Ultra in the UK	"Hi all! Hope you're well and safe. 
I'm moving to the UK soon and bought a S22 Ultra a couple of days ago. Did not find out about Samsung's inexplicable and baffling region locks on the phones and certain features (Samsung Pay, etc.) before I bought the phone. Consequently, I've been researching on all issues I think I could face once I move to the UK later this month. Had a few questions about the same, so thought I'd reach out for help here. 
a) I understand that Samsung Pay will not be available in the UK on my Indian S22, due to the region lock. Is this correct? To clarify, I don't intend to change the CSC if I'll only be losing Samsung Pay, as I'm sure Google Pay will be sufficient. 
b) I understand that UK S22s are Exynos-based and not Snapdragon-based. Therefore, am I correct in assuming that I will be unable to flash UK firmware on my device, due to the SoCs being different? 
c) I'm using a Samsung Galaxy Watch 4. I tried installing Google Pay on my watch, but was unable to find the app on the Play Store. Further reading led me to Google Pay's website, which states that Google Pay for Wear OS is only available in select countries, including the UK, with India not being included. Would I be correct in assuming that once I change the country on my Google account, I will have access to the app on my watch? Also, would the watch automatically have access to apps in the UK once my Google account's country is changed? 
d) I understand that the international version of the S22 Ultra (which I believe is the model I'm using) will have no problems connecting to 5G networks in the UK, since most networks in the UK use band 78. Can anyone who's travelled to the UK confirm if they've been able to successfully access 5G networks in the UK on their Indian S22s? 
Thank you for taking the time to read this post. Grateful for any help I can get!

&amp;#x200B;
1. Does the S22 have any extra screen protection besides Gorilla Glass Victus+? I bought it 3 days ago, and I see that it has small scratches on the screen, which should not happen with the Victus+, so I think it has some kind of extra material in addition to the Victus+ but I'm not sure.
2. Should I use a screen protector? My cell phone is most of the time on the worktable, and I am careful with it.

Questions about S Pen, camera related	"So I just realized I can use the S Pen as a remote control for the shutter on my camera. But I have questions about doing this. 
1. After taking the pen out and opening the camera, how long will the S Pen stay connected to the phone where it will actually still activate the shutter and take a picture? It seems to be in the past when I have used the S-pen, then set it down for a few minutes, it would disconnect and I would have to reinsert it and take it out again to wake it back up.
2. How long will the battery last in the S pen using it this way? More of a general S pen battery question than anything really. I think it would be cool to set up the phone on a shelf at the start of a party, and just periodically throughout the night (a few hours) snap a pic of the same area. Sort of like a time lapse, but pictures not at a set interval but instead controlled by the S pen. 
3. How far from my phone can I get with the S Pen and still used this feature? I assume a 10-20' range is ok, seeing as how the main use of this would be to activate the cam for group pictures. But if I could be even farther away, that would be great."	N

5G uw killing battery	"I have had good battery life with my S22 Ultra. Recently Verizon activated 5G UW in my neighborhood. Sometimes its 5G UW, then 5G. Today my battery depleted from 46% to 5% in a matter of 2 hours. This is while in my pocket and cutting the lawn. Samsung store used to have a band selector app, which I have, that would allow me just to stay on 4G LTE, which is fine for normal use. Unfortunately since the latest June firmware update, this app is blocked and will not work.
Has anyone found a work around. I'm sure the battery discharged because it kept changing and seeking the different 5G. Any help appreciated."	N

Screen Protector Dilemma	"     I'm currently using a protective film that looks, feels, and operates smoothly. Fingerprint accuracy has been 100%. 
My problems is, I prefer tempered glass, if only for the protection. I accidentally drop my phones maybe 4 times a year, but when I do, the tempered glass always needs replaced.

battery degradation	"Since upgrading from a note8 I have the ability to limit my charging to 85% which I thought would be life changing because the battery life on my note8 was terrible. Naturally I started using accubattery to check on my remaining capacity and other related info.

So am I overreacting or is anyone else facing this issue?
In addition to this, I'm having some general overheating issues with light to moderate use -if downloading/ streaming and video viewing is considered moderate use- and the battery doesn't go the entire day

Automatic encryption when turning off?	"My old Galaxy (Android 9) featured a password prompt every startup to decrypt the automatic encryption that is done every time it's turned off.

Anyone had this?
Just think it's crazy, as even if I used my old iPhone for the same tasks, it would fast charge to 50% in under 30 mins, regardless if I was facetiming or using maps or a heavy game or app, but the s22U can't handle it?"	N

Temperature while Gaming	I know some people will say no it's not truth this phone is hot like oven and all or they have issues after july update.

Temperature was going upto 48¬∞ within 5 minutes and then frame drops. But after july update that problem solved. Yesterday first time i had free time to play game for longer time after update . And maximum temperature in 2 hours playtime was 44¬∞ while being in the game, but after returning to the main menu that goes down to 38¬∞ everytime and no FPS drops. So for mw that is big improvement with one small update. Also the phone feels more smoother	N

Is there any better smart phone camera than s22 ultra?	Tell me	N
waited 2 weeks for the samsung official screen protector and my screen got chewed up so bad in that time I think I might get a new screen, why don't they include this with the phone?	My guess is because the screen protector sucks and the finger sensor doesn't work with it on, even at the highest sensitivity and they didn't want to deal with the warranty issue of people saying the already weak sensor doesn't work. I tried a glass one with similar issues and a butt ugly circle in the middle of the screen. I convinced myself the lack of memory and the curved glass wouldn't be too bad but a few weeks into owning my first samsung galaxy product I can confidently say i hate the screen, like they could've solved all these issues and made the phone look better just by making it flat like the s22+. and my 128gb only has 20 gbs left and then I guess I'm forced to buy a Google cloud subscription? Why not make the glass flat? Why not add a card reader? I left apple hoping for more right to repair and more freedom in what I own but I feel like I swapped to a much shittier ui and a slower chip to have the same issues. I want to like this phone, am I missing something?	N

Looking for a rugged case that will work with my magnetic car mount	"I just pulled the trigger on my new phone, but I'm looking for a rugged case that will work with my MagicMount. Currently on my Note 10+ I have a dbrand Grip and while I really like having the skin on it, I just feel like doesn't provide enough protection, particularly on the curved edges of the screen (I really wish they would've gone with a completely flat screen on the Ultra like the rest of the S22 lineup) 
I'm thinking of either going with a UAG Monarch or Plasma (I like that it's a tough case that's still clear) or an Otterbox Defender, but I was wondering, with the way they're designed, would I even be able to put a magnet on the back of the UAG cases? 
Also, any other case recommendations would be highly appreciated."	N

How many times have you setup your S22 Ultra?	"I've only had my phone a month or two and about to restore it again.  I think in a debloatitng frenzy I removed adaptive sound and one handed operation.  It sautoriskg to me there's not better documenting of what all those files so.
I've been an iPhone guy for a long time and am all Apple at home.  I really dislike Google and their invasive data collection which is one of the reasons I have avoided Android, but the S22 is pretty great, and I love all the things I can do on it that I can't do on iOS.
That's why I'm on my fifth reinstall... each time I change my strategy a little.  I was removing most fi the Samsung software and going for a more Pixel feel, but I've grown to appreciate some of the Samsung stuff so I'm going to try that.

Phone stolen, what now?	"So last weekend I got my Samsung S22 Ultra stolen (UK, London) and yes it felt horrible and ever since then I've been feeling stressed out almost every day. I‚Äôve already reported the incident to the police, blacklisted my IMEI number and got a replacement sim.
The current phone I have to deal with now is my rooted OnePlus 5T and honestly, I hate the feeling of using it. Feels slow, often restarts by itself every now and then and of course 4G can‚Äôt compete with 5G.
At this point I‚Äôm unsure of what to do in terms of deciding what my daily driver is, whilst waiting &amp; hoping for the police to somehow, someway revive my phone back. I don‚Äôt know how long they will take, but I feel most likely they‚Äôll take a very long time.
These are the only options I can think of, as my head is all over the place:
* Should I go with a monthly contact and includes the S22 Ultra
* Buy from a second-hand market
* Get a cheaper alternative (e.g. A52)
* Stick with my OnePlus 5T"	N

Clip tray partially disabled	Hi, folks. I recently switched from an LG V20 to the S22+, and am very happy so far ‚Äì except that on the new phone, the clip tray function (used with GBoard keyboard on birth devices) doesn't work in some applications.

Group Messaging Issues - Returning S22 Ultra, but for what?	"Looking for thoughts on what to replace the S22 Ultra with.  We have an issue that hours of phone support with TMobile &amp; Samsung has been unable to resolve, and are returning the brand new phones.  We are not receiving responses in group messages from friends/family with iPhones.  Was never a problem with our Note 10's on Verizon.  Apparently this stems from an issue with the pre-installed Google Messaging on the S22 series.  
Almost every smartphone we've owned has been Samsung, so this is frustrating to say the least.  Any other good quality phones we should look at replacing these with?  I'm willing to consider an iPhone just to keep up with the majority of our circle better, but the husband wants to stick with Android.  Thanks for your thoughts."	N

How much more worth it is the S22 compared to the S21?	"How much more worth it is the S22 compared to the S21?
I've been using the S10 since its launch and I've absolutely fallen in love with it ever since I've gotten it, but a recent mishap has basically rendered my phone unusable so I've decided to upgrade.
Looking at both, the S22 seems like a good purchase because of the updated processor and the longer guarantee for security updates, but apparently it's smaller compared to the S21 with a smaller battery?
On the other hand, the S21 looks like it's still on par with the S22, with a seemingly better battery life, but I have seen reviews of it overheating which concerns me because I tend to use my phone a lot within the day.
I want to know the opinion of the community, and more importantly people who've owned either one or both of these phones because I do hope to be able to use this phone as my daily driver for at least another 4-5 years."	N

4G+ is meant to be faster than 4G but doesn't seem to be so. Is it the phone or the provider as I never had this issue with the S10 previously"	N
Upgrading from S10+ to S22 Ultra 5G	"First of all, I have to salute this phone. It's in the top tier, but I need to upgrade. The S22 ~~Note~~ Ultra looks nice, however I really wish that the edges weren't curved; for this reason, I'm also considering the S22+. To think the last Samsung I had with flat edges was the S5...
Also, I've never owned a Note before, so I've never been able to use an S Pen - whether I'll use it often or not is totally unknown. Taking pictures might be fun I guess?
Anyone with the Ultra, can you tell me what your experience has been so far? Mainly, how does your battery fare daily, and does the S Pen have any real beneficial use besides taking pictures remotely? If anyone has upgraded recently from an S10 or similar, is the jump up massive or underwhelming?"	N
How's the S22 Ultra these days, post updates?	"Currently have an S20+ that I absolutely love, minus my 5G cutting in and out constantly on Verizon and often being slower than 4g (problem an issue with location).
However, my USB port seems to be starting to go (won't fast charge for more than a couple minutes, Android Auto disconnects off and on). I've tried cleaning out the port to no avail, so I just ordered the S22u while it was on sale/could get good trade in.
I'm somewhat considering just returning the new phone because I really don't feel like I NEED to upgrade, but the port issues are somewhat annoying and I'm not sure if it'll get worse and just be completely unusable. I can charge wirelessly, but I really like Android Auto and like to be able to charge my phone with a cord when needed.

S22 camera	Interesting case that came in 2 weeks after the tech did a screen repair for the s22.When the customer went into the camera app, you could see patches on the left hand side of the screen as if they looked like water droplets. When the customer exited out of the camera app, the home screen is fine, just the camera app was showing those patches. My tech disassembled the camera and reassembled but said that he feels it is a flaw with the camera and the issue came back after reseating the camera cable. Since the camera is new and Samsung can't send us the parts, my tech had to process a warranty exchange through T-Mobile. The phone works fine just the camera has the issue with the patches.	N

Understanding Screen On Time	Help me out with this guy's. Digital well being says a certain time when you look at SOT. And I assume it's refreshed when I open that app.Then I open device care and it tells me how long the battery has been on since the last full charge. When I click the screen it tells me SOT and Phone off times. The SOT on that screen is longer then the Digital Wellbeing.Which one is the correct one and why are they both different times?Galaxy S22 +	N

iPhone User Contemplating Switch	Hello all! I currently have an iPhone 13 pro max and love the battery on it but that‚Äôs about it. I don‚Äôt like the lack of customization and options that Samsung provides and apple currently doesn‚Äôt. I know the Ultra has battery issues. I know that because I‚Äôve been lurking this subreddit for awhile and seen the posts. I know the battery won‚Äôt be good compared to the iPhone. I guess carrying a charger isn‚Äôt the worst thing ever. I‚Äôd just have to get used to carrying one. Any recommendations on where to buy the ultra? Any recommendations on chargers to carry? I work on the go as a bus driver so I can‚Äôt access a wall charger so it‚Äôd have to be a portable one. Thanks for your time! Have a great day!	N
S Pen and PDF documents	I am in school and travel a lot. Can the phone with S Pen highlight PDF documents? I am looking for a portable alternative to my laptop when I am on the go and on the train for reviewing and marking pdf articles.	N

S22 ultra S-pen... just fell in love	"Just got an S22 ultra and I've never used a stylus before and I think it's just the coolest thing.  Was expecting to buy an iphone or pixel 6 but theclerk talked me into this. So surprised how much i love the stylus. It's very precise, fast,  and allows for less fingerprints on the screen. I can't explain why, other then precision and speed, but it just feels like a game changer. I really really like how it's built into the phone.
Question, anyone else love the stylus? Anyone know any games it's or apps that might be fun to use it with!"	N
Hello All! I have the SD version and struggling with battery and can only mange 3-4 SOT, is this normal? I've factory rest once without using smart switch but imported everything using samsung cloud. Should I factory reset again and restore everything but apps? I have had the phone since may.		N

Question on data transfer to new phone	"My first Samsung was an S21. Traded it in for a Flip3 but set it up as new. Just ordered a S22U and I'm thinking about trying the built in Samsung cable-to-cable transfer this time before sending the flip back.
Is this a good idea or a meh idea? Not sure if it's going to bring any flip specific stuff over that won't be used, or if it's strictly things like settings and accounts? Is the transfer method considered ""cleaner"" or is setting it up from scratch the way to go? I plan on resetting it out of the box to eliminate bloat, but after that I was thinking of trying it. Previous phones were iphones and their transfer tool could do some weird stuff ( like I thinking the new phone was the same model as the old phone, stuff like that) so I just wanted to ask the hive mind. Tia!"	N
I wanted to update and thank everyone for their kind words. I brought my phone to 2 different fix it stores and was told the same thing, that I should have known better and backed my data up. Lesson learned.		N
How often has Samsung done these trade-in deals?	"As of right now, samsung.com is offering $1000 towards the S22U in the U.S. after trading in the S21 Ultra (even if the glass is damaged). Has anyone upgrading in the past (such as S20U to S21U) gotten similarly good offers? I'm just gauging to see if this is a common track record with them.
And I could be remembering wrong, but I think these trade-in offers right now are better than they were during the S22 pre-orders."	N

Mowei glass screen protector	"Quick user review of the Mowei glass screen protector:
Background: I've used the Whitestone Dome glass screen protectors on my wife and my phones since we got our S22 Ultras. However, I kept chipping the sides within a couple of months of installation. Sure, they have a lifetime warranty, but warranty replacements are only like $5 less expensive. We started looking for another option. These seem well rated and were priced at $36 for three ($12 each) vs Whitedome's $45 for two ($22.5 each). They came in tonight and we did the installation.
Compared to Whitestone Dome:
**Pros**
* Much less expensive (almost half the price)
* Smoother edges
* Much better fingerprint reading
* Excellent customer service
* Warranty replacement at almost no cost
**Cons**
* Inferior installation kit
* I got bubbles on 2/3 installs (They are sending out a new set, zero hassle)
* No camera cut out (this doesn't seem to affect quality, though, so maybe a pro?)
* Glue stinks
* One year warranty vs lifetime
Now to see how durable they are. I'll try to remember to update this post. Feel free to tag me in a reply for an update.

I just swapped from iPhone 13 pro to s22 ultra and I need help with google assistant	Why the hell does it stay open all the time? Like it seems to be really really good but the window doesn't automatically close once it does the command. For example, if I am laying in bed and I need the flashlight on once I prompt it and it turns it on the assistant stays open/keeps the phone unlocked. Is this normal with google assistant or is there a setting I can change to make it close after a prompt or silence? cause it is extremely annoying. Also, it doesn't talk back to me it just beeps. is there a way to set it so if I say "Text so and so" It verbally replies with "what would you like to say" or something like that instead of just a beep? cause I have bad hearing and I need more of a prompt. Anyway enjoying the switch so far just need a little guidance and assistance. Thank you!	N

AT&amp;T S22 Ultra SOFTWARE UPDATE PROBLEM	"Hello, I got an unlocked S22 Ultra form AT&amp;T and it showed no software updates since January from the Settings-SoftwareUpdate Menu.Every time I checked from there showed no updates available.
Saw a post in this forum that said to try from Smart Switch.
I checked from SmartSwitch and it showed an update from March which was finished successfully while connected to the computer.
Now when I check for a new update on the phone and  also from SmartSwitch no new updates are shown and it says I got the latest update installed, but it cannot be possible that the March Update is the latest for the S22 Ultra because I ve seen in other forums that they even started to release a July update.
Any help would be appreciated."	N
Heavy gaming on s22?	"Okay so i got my base S22 SD for 12 days now, have made some tweaks with config and now I get some ""acceptable"" SoT around 5:30 barely 6h average use.
Have been playing some heavy stuff like CoDM and specially AetherSX2 PS2 emulator (Gran Turismo 4) using BT headphones and BT joystick, the battery drains about 16 to 19% per hour with Power saving.
Here's my current battery run:
https://imgur.com/LPTCVoi
always 120hz cause i PAID FOR IT, but i use some Bixby routines to set power saving mode to apps that don't run (or don't need to) 120hz like YT or AetherSX2 cause the emulator only runs at 60 wich is PS2's max framerate.
Can I squeeze more SoT with this phone or it's the best I can get?

Galaxy S22+ speakers are SIGNIFICANTLY worse than Galaxy S10+	"That's the whole post. I just upgraded out of necessity since my s10+ was malfunctioning. Speakers still work though, and I decided to compare the speakers on each. 
S22+ speakers are terrible. They're super quiet, have horrible range, and a fuzzy overall sound compared to the S10+. The top speaker on the S22+ sounds like it's in another room if I cover the bottom one, it's completely muffled by the phone shell. It's not even close between the two. My settings are the exact same between them, it's not Dolby Atmos being switched off. The speakers are just objectively much worse."	N

S22 ULTRA SLOWDOWN	Hi Guys, i have recently bought a new S22 Ultra (128Gb, 8gb Ram) and i feel the camera app launch is taking a lot of time as well as few apps like snap chat and Instagram, while using them as well it unexpectedly slows down near to hanging i thought long gone were the days of Android of such problems.

Abysmal battery performance	"I have this phone for two months now (S22+ Exynos) and yesterday was the worst day in terms of battery life.
Fully charged from 8 am and the phone died in 10 pm. I listen to only downloaded songs and playlists from Spotify and it drains so much battery is ridiculous. Never had this problem with my previous S8+. Google Services is still a pain in the booty. July update does not look good, never had such a bad battery experience so far.
I haven't changed anything or have limited my user experience. I believe that it's ridiculous to tweak a 1000‚Ç¨ smartphone. Most times it lasts me until I go to sleep but the battery today was really bad.

S21 FE vs S22+ Prime Day Deals	"I'm looking for a Samsung Galaxy phone for my mom, who's upgrading from the S8+. She's looking for a phone around this size (bigger than 6.2"" from the S8+), pretty good camera, good everyday usage, but what's most important for her is the battery life. Does anyone which phone would make more sense for her? Also, would either phone last her longer in terms of the phone working, or would they be about the same?
The price for the phones on prime is currently 489.99$ for the S21 FE and 699.99$ for the S22+ (USD). Is it worth it to pay 210$ more for the S22+?

Samsung Store vs. Play Store	"As an iPhone user still getting used to my S22u I was wondering how people deal with the two different stores.  I don't understand why they even exist, it seems like most of nor all of the Samsung stuff is on Play Store anyway.  It feels like Samsung is just playing a ""me too"" game with Apple and Google adding things that are unwanted and unneeded so they can pretend they're in the same league (they're not).
Opinions aside, how do most people deal with the two stores?  If someone were to want to de-Google their phone it would still be hard not to use the Play Store as the Samsung Store is missing a lot.  It seems like I'm installing the Samsung Apps and reinstalling then from the Play Store would be cleaner?
Also do people check the stores manually everyday for updates?"	N
Any tips for getting debris/dust out of s22u upper speaker?	"I just had a UV screen protector installed a few days ago, but the shop didn't do much of a good job and left a big chunk of UV glue inside the tiny hole of the upper speaker. I tried needles and a sim card extractor but they couldn't fit and ended up causing a small scratch on the side. 
Has anyone experienced this problem before?
And for those who think of getting UV screen protector, I highly recommend putting scotch tapes around your device before pouring the glue on the screen. It might get off and stick to the sides of your s22."	N

iPhone 13PM or s22u?	I know this has been probably posted a million times but which phone should I buy? I was planning on the 14 but my X randomly died so I'm out looking for a new phone. The new 14 comes out in two months but I'd prefer not to wait that long. I'm no heavy user(watching videos, scrolling through social media), need a phone that'll last me through school without the need of recharging. I'm used to apple but open to trying android so OS isn't really an issue for me. Heard that Samsung had stutter issues(?). In terms of pricing, I can get the s22u for 1500(aud) whilst the iPhone would run me back $1900. Any advice on which I should buy?	N
S21U -&gt; S22U	"So I've had my S21U since it's launch and it's a good phone. I do have issues with the black back absorbing a lot of heat when I'm outdoors and the the camera app will sometimes fail due to getting so hot. One of the things that matters most to me is camera reliability. With the S21U, the camera errors out alot, closes, stops filming videos and the shutter speed is atrocious. I travel a ton and really rely on the phones camera for photos since the output is really good.
I wasn't too interested in upgrading to the S21U at release because there weren't too many changes between the two  but, I saw they were doing a deal right now where they will give me $1k for my current device and the watch4 (which I don't want because I still have an older watch that I rarely use and works fine). But my logic was that the phone cost me exactly $300 to upgrade to and I figured I could flip the watch on eBay for $300 and cover the cost of the phone, plus I like the look of the white and figure it would reflect the heat from the sun better.
Question is, how was the camera performance compared to the S21U to the S22U? Does anyone notice the camera performing better/snappier? Does anyone with the white version notice it staying cooler outdoors?
Thanks!"	N

Upgrade? s20+ to s22U	"Hello! My situation is as follows. I've got a s20+ that is fully paid off and that is working great. My carrier plan is 30Gb of data for roughly 22 USD per month (with current exchange rate from swedish currency).
My carrier is currently doing a student promotion for the s22U with 100Gb data for 45 USD/month for 36 months. With this deal I'd essentially pay roughly 600usd for an s22U and much more data over my current plan. I can also sell the s20+ for 300ish.
Since I'm in the EU I will get the exynos variant which has less than stellar reviews. I'm pondering waiting for the s23U that should be out in february next year. An S23U will be more expensive since I graduate in january and can't use student promotions but money will be less of an issue then after I start working.
Given these circumstances, would you take the S22U or wait for S23U? Thanks for reading."	N

Set Preferred Network to 4G	"I want to set the Pref Network to 4G on my S22+ . But I see these 4 options only: 5G, LTE, 2G &amp; 3G (i.e. no 4G) 
when I select Pref Network within the Mobile Networks section.
Is LTE same as 4G? I presume it is quite different based on my short research.
Is there a way to Select 4G?"	N
It's the 5G.....	"I've been seeing a lot of posts complaining about the battery life on these phones and I have made many tweaks. But I'll be honest the main thing you can do to improve your battery life is TURN OFF YOUR 5G. 
Doing so has saved so much battery life for me. Normally I would have to charge at 4pm after starting my day at 7am. After switching to 4G I'm still at 60% and my screen on time doubled. My AOD is tap to show. I personally have access to 5G and it's great to stream FHD but I'll take HD streaming at 720p if it means my battery can actually last me the whole day.
Try it out and hopefully it'll work for you as well.

If you could move from a S21U to an S22U for an incredibly minimal cost (sub $200) would you? Why/Why Not?

s22 battery life question (thinking of upgrading)	I have been thinking of getting a s22 for a while but keep seeing people say how bad the battery is, I mainly use my phone for YouTube and entertainment with a bit of social media, does the battery actually only last for less than 5 hours on s22, on my S10 plus I can get 4 hours of YouTube playback with it using around 40% according to the Samsung battery settings, how does this compare to what a s22 (Exynos) would get?

Brightness set below medium with screen on 120hz. I disabled a lot of things in the background, as per some instructions found on this forum, but still...

Making the jump to s22 ultra?	"Hi reddit!
I come here looking for advice. I am currently owner of a OnePlus 8t which i got at a bargain price sometime at the beginning of 2021. Phone's ok, got some major issue with software (like losing the ability to use usb-c headphones at all) but overall day to day use has not been affected much. Camera's ok, not really digged much into all the options for it.
Recently I got a S7 FE tablet with a 50% discount and absolutely fell IN LOVE with the S Pen, and I saw that the s22 ultra is currently going for 1k in the 256/12GB version, which is a price I'd be willing to spend on it. 
So, what i ask you more experienced users is: will i notice some major differences? And is the s pen on a smartphone useful as I find it on the tablet?
Also the only option available here is te Exynos version, is it really that bad?"	N

New Feature Request - Screen turn on for notification	Please add a system-wide or per application toggle for the screen to turn on when we get a notification. It's very useful for anyone like me who has a phone on the desk and can read the notification immediately and then swipe it away, without having to manually turn on the screen every time we hear the notification sound. And also add pocket detection to prevent turning on if it's inside your pocket. I think iphone has this feature, which is worth borrowing.I'm currently using Glimpse Notification as a workaround for this problem. The reason for this suggestion is for Samsung to natively support it in OneUI, so I don't have to run another 3rd party app that sucks resource and battery in the background (and of course more reliability natively).

I have patiently explained every pro the issue I'm facing, it seems to an unquie issue as reported by almost every pro.After all this Samsung's expectation is that I send my phone for repair and be without a phone for approximately 5-7 business days. Additionally Samsung denies providing a loaner. What horrible customer service is this. I even offered to buy a new phone if they'd let me trade in my current phone, however they cannot.

Does wiping cache partition delete temporay Android security update files?	Hello,I'm using a S22+ on Android May security update. I accidentally click Download for the Android June security update but luckily paused it in time before it finishes.

The annoying thing is there is now a constant "Download paused" notification that can't be cleared. I want to get rid of it.

S-22 Ultra vs S-21 Ultra question	Apologies if a repeat question. I've had my 21 for the last year now. I do not hate it at all but I also do not love it. The issues have been mostly minor but these can add up and become frustrating. The most frustrating is the echo complaint I get from others when I have it on speaker. Although as of late I have not had anyone complain about this. I really do not need to spend the money to switch over to the S-22 but for those who have done this have you found it to be worthwhile?

S22 Ultra appreciation post	"I have been following the sub since the beginning. There are tons of photo posts and bug posts. I own the phone for 3 months now, and wanted to post how awesome the phone is!  
[Battery stat. July update. SD version. Taken today.](https://preview.redd.it/09wvge77wnb91.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85859ad27186f4be28078ea40949bac85a5cf6a5)
Bought the black version (SD) , with clear cover case. Added hydrogel screen guard (fingerprint works flawlessly), as a bonus the screen is now matte and spen feels like writing on paper.  
\-Everyone knows that the camera is awesome! I have been using RX100M3 as my primary camera, but S22 Ultra replaced it. Now I rarely carry my camera.  
\-Battery: Easily lasts me 1.5 days with 15-20% juice left. On heavy days it lasts me 24 hrs (Lots of GPS, Screen time, Video calls, etc)  
\-Performance: Never had any issues. Had micro lags but June update fixed that.  
I use the phone mostly for photography, office work and note taking. Earlier I used to carry a pocket diary for work, that has also gone now. The phone is large, no doubt about it, but I am carrying a very good camera, a diary and a phone, all in one."	N
Should I upgrade from my S20 to the S22 Ultra	" I have had the S20 5G for a couple of years now and was wondering if I should upgrade to the S22 ultra? I primarily want it for the pen as I do a lot of sketches and write a lot of notes, but I also like the ram as I multitask A LOT.
The main reason I want to upgrade is that my battery is starting to reach below the 15% range after a 8hr shift at work, and I only use it at my two 15 minute breaks. The other reasons are that the fingerprint sensor only works half the time, for some reason my Wi-Fi is finicky, and people sometimes cant hear me on phone calls."	N
Do you feel any RAM difference (12gb vs 8gb) going from an S21 ultra to S22 ultra?	"I have an s22 ultra coming as a replacement device since my s21 ultra went downhill. Just wondering do you even really feel the ram difference
Clarification: I saw someone was a bit confused. The s21 ultra I have has 12gb of ram, 128 GB of storage. The s22 ultra coming has 8gb of ram and 128 GB of storage."	N

How can I remap the side button	So I currently have an s10e but I just broke it so instead of getting it repaired I'm thinking I'll upgrade to the s22 as I was planning to do so soon anyways.

I understand with the s22 the power button has been combined with the Bixby button. Is there a way I can remap the side button to maybe do a double press for a screenshot and a long press for the flashlight? Even if I need another third party app to do so.

For my Galaxy S22 Plus, Samsung accepted my slightly (but clearly) bent Galaxy S20 FE. It met all the requirements on the website. What do you think?	"My S20 FE got bent one day in late May. I really made sure to not ever accidentally drop it or be careless with it, and the device near got and cracks, shatters, etc. I bought a heat gun, replacement battery, replacement screen, and replacement adhesive to it to repair it myself, however much of a bad idea you think that is. I replaced the battery first and the device was working again, I ended up returning the screen &amp; heat gun.
There was no insurance on the device, and the manufacturer warranty had expired (from a phone call with Samsung support). I didn't want to pay a lot to repair the device and decided to just get a new phone and buy Samsung Care+ for that. I did a trade in of my S20 FE for $475, applied the T-mboile activation (also looking back at the website and student discount and paid \~$356 for the device. Btw, I really wish I had waited until lately to actually get the device, I could've gotten a much better deal!).
I got an email from Samsung today that my trade in device, the S20 FE got accepted for $475 credit towards my new S22 Plus. On the purchase page, I selected ""Good Condition"", since the screen wasn't actually cracked (and there were *zero* display issues / defects like vertical lines or black spots). Here's what it says for requirements:
&gt;It starts up to the home screen and functions normally.  
&gt;  
&gt;Any software locks will be disabled, accounts will be removed and it will be factory reset before you ship it.  
&gt;  
&gt;The screen, body and camera lenses are free of cracks. We also accept devices with cracked screens at reduced value  
&gt;  
&gt;The device is not on a banned list. You will include the charger or charger case, if applicable.
I also looked at the [trade in terms and conditions](https://www.samsung.com/us/trade-in/terms-and-conditions/), and it doesn't mention anything about bends, just cracks, dents, and dings. It might be weird or crazy that my device got accepted, **but at the end of the day Samsung inspected my phone and determined it met the trade-in requirements to give me credit.** (the device had the status ""DEVICE TRIAGE"" meaning inspection, from the 12th to today)."

If I get a fold, there's probably not much use for a tablet after all, right? I'd rather have all my devices in one if possible. 
Anyone else ditch their tablet after getting the fold?
I love my s22u but the note taking experience is extremely lacking.. I take all my notes on my tab s6 lite, but I like to write on my calendar which doesn't sync over to other devices. 
And I study/work on my tab s6 lite, but it's annoying to carry around with me.

Want to return new S22 Ultra to AT&amp;T store and rebuy at best buy. How difficult will this be?	"So my old phone (Note 20 ultra) got the ""black screen of death"" and after trying several fixes that didn't work I decided to just pay off the remainder and upgrade to the S22 Ultra.
I went to the AT&amp;T store and bought it, and was told I had 30 days to come up with a phone to trade in for the $800 credit, so I haven't traded anything in yet (I already have an S5 to trade in so that's not an issue, I just haven't turned it in yet). I then saw a few days later that Best Buy has a promotion where you can get $250 off in addition to the $800 trade in through AT&amp;T.
I specifically want the 256gb variant which is not in stock at any best buy near me so it would need to be shipped to me.
So what's the best way to go about doing all of this? Am I able to buy the new S22 Ultra at best buy, have it shipped to me, transfer everything, then go return the one I bought earlier at an AT&amp;T store? Or will there be some funky stuff going on with my account where I would have to return the S22 Ultra I bought at AT&amp;T first in order to buy at best buy? 
It will be 14 days on the 24th from when I purchased the phone from the AT&amp;T store. I know I'll pay a $55 restocking fee but besides that will there be any weird charges like a double activation fee or double upgrade fees or whatever? Will I still be able to trade in a phone for the promotion or will it think I've already done the promo and say I'm ineligible?"	N

Samsung Screen Protector	took a leap this week and ordered the samsung screen protector from amazon. i had read the earlier reviews on the samsung site and most of them weren't good, but for $16 and free shipping from amazon i was willing to give it a try. i gotta say, its only been on for a few days, but its pretty good. damn near feels like the screen protector that came on the note 10+ when i first got it. no fingers sticking occasionally, scrolling and using the pen is also nice and smooth. after it settled in for 24 hours, you can hardly tell its there if it wasn't for the camera notch. install was simple as well, it comes with a tray that the bottom of the phone sits in, start at the middle and go from there.

An old Lumia 920 user reminiscing...	I have to say that the look and feel of the S22 Ultra gives me flashbacks to my trusty old black Lumia 920. Solid candy bar feel, focus on great optics and screen. Perhaps the only difference is I felt I could truly use and abuse the nokia without a case - not so much the S22U! First time since that phone, though, that I've truly enjoyed a device - perhaps only the iPhone 7 Plus comes close (I had one in Piano Black and portrait mode was very cool - almost more natural than current iPhones)	N
Recent Decision by mods to not allow links - can this be discussed??	"Apparently, as stated by a mod in a recent post regarding a new Samsing App, the mods decided to no longer allow links for safety reasons.

back scratches easily	"I bought caseology neon pop when i got the phone and after a few weeks i randomly removed the case and saw the back there were many small scratches(more like small dots of scratches). I first thought it was the case's fault cause it has some grooves inside. But my dad's s22ultra also has these dot scratches and he doesn't have the same case. Why is the back of this so extremely scratchy. 
And for people who are going to type dont cry about scratches. No a normal phone does not scratch this easily
Edit- the scratches are only visible in light"	N
Snagged a Spigen Thin Fit on Prime Day on a whim. Time to eat some crow.	"I have always been pretty OCD about phone damage. Cycle through several phones a year so I keep them pristine to retain resale value. 
When I say OCD I mean I still have the factory plastics on the sides, top and bottom of the phone. 
Always avoided  slim cases. Which is dumb because I also pay for Samsung Protection every month so the phone is covered for damage. 
Have Ghostek Covert, Mous Speckled Fabric, and the official Samsung S View Cover case. 
Also using Magsafe rings with a slim Magsafe wallet on the Ghostek and Samsung case. 
Started to get bored with the phone using the bulkier cases. The S View Cover case also gets annoying sometimes when using the camera or basic use with the cover flopping around. 
Saw lots of praises for the Spigen Thin Fit but largely ignored it and said it was stupid because it's such a fragile phone and offers minimal protection. 
Man. I need to eat my words. 
This case makes it feel like a brand new phone. It's so much easier to hold and I feel less fatigued using it. 
For daily use it still offers decent protection. The cameras have a slightly raised ring around the three biggies. The front had adequate lips top and bottom to keep the screen off of surfaces when it's face down. 
I freaking love this case and wish I tried it sooner."	N

Is there an issue with the S22 Ultra screen cracking easily ? My ordeal with it cracking the screen.	"Story time, (edit at the bottom)
I was one of the early adopter of the S22U. Fast phone, AMAZING cam, very heavy and kind of uncomfortable to hold. From day one the phone didnt feel safe to me so I bought a ""good"" screen protector and a ""good"" case. Fast forward a few weeks later and I take the phone out of my pocket, to find that the screen protector and screen are both cracked. The specific damage on the screen was on the left side, right where the screen starts to curve. I am guessing this phone has two panels as the top half was working with no issue and the bottom half was flashing. The damage on the screen was exactly where the two panels split into even halfs. I gave it the benefit of the doubt of my bumping into something and cracking the screen, but I know I didnt as I would have checked on the phone right away.
I put the phone away knowing that Samsung has been running promos on screen repairs, so I waited and caught the $50 promo they recently ran. I send it in, they repair the screen and panel and all is back to normal. I purchased a Unicorn Beetle case that made this phone look like a small tablet, hoping to keep the phone safe until I trade it in for something else.
2 weeks later and im home falling asleep on the sofa, phone is on my lap, phone rings, startles me, I make a sudden move and drop the phone about 2 feet on to a vinyl plank floor. It land on the screen, but since I have this heavy ass case with the ""best of the best"" screen protector (""gET a WhITEstoNE bRO""), I wasnt faced and answer my call. When I go to hang up, THERE IT IS, the same crack, at the same spot, same issue with the scree as the previous crack. WTF!
I have had maaaaaaaaaany phones in my lifetime and have always taken very good care of them due to me always trading in or selling them. I  can recall of only cracking screens on 3 of them, a Nextel I dropped directly on a rock (showing my age here), a Galaxy S7 Edge, a curved screens, and now this bad boy that has cracked twice, again a curved screen. This phone always felt delicate and the screen has proven to be just that, at least to me. 
I have seen some pictures and videos online and some have this same exact crack, which has me asking if there is a manufacturing defect or design issue going on with this phone. Has anyone here dealt with this crack on the left side where the screen meets the frame?
I was on a call for 2 hours with Samsung support and was able to get them to give me that $50 promo to repair the screen one more time. Getting rid of this phone as soon as it comes back.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Edit: Some of you make it seem as if I I'm on a crusade of some sort. Yes, I dropped my phone. No, it shouldn't just crack in my pocket, unless I hit something pretty hard, which I didn't. Then have it fixed, come back as new and have the same exact break on the glass just off a simple fall. I am not clumsy with phones, and ""normal"" falls have never been an issue for me other than with Galaxy curved devices.
Here is an exact example of the same exact break I have experienced twice
https://youtu.be/lL5Pi-yHd-A
Another link in which they talk about the issue,
https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/t55b33/s22_ultra_screen_is_very_fragile/
On Twitter there are a lot of conversations about it also. A lot of them talking about the exact break on the curve. 2 things are constant with the info I have read online, early adopters and falls that any other phones may have survived. I am aware of the stress point, the curve and so on.
Again, awesome phone, best camera I have used, but me, myself, I, moi, mich, don't feel comfortable with the glass screen on this phone... and that was from day one."	N
S22U use CDMA sim card	"I'm a Chinese in Singapore right now, wishing to buy a S22U. But I have a sim card from China Telecom. I know Singapore don't have CDMA here.

screen fix	"my screen broke two days ago (i seriously dont know how) but my options are to get it fixed by samsung themselves(for about $300), going to a third party phone fixer (also $300 with a lifetime warranty), or going to an ATT store and getting it fixed for $30. OBVIOUSLY the most reasonable choice would be to get it fixed for $30 but im very skeptical. im not sure if the screen replacement will be LCD or if anything else will be different, such as brightness, performance, or features such as the fingerprint scanner. i have the money to replace it but id rather get it fixed for $30, but i wouldnt do so if it comes at a bigger cost.
note: im 99% sure water resistance will be non existant after getting it fixed by att/asurion themselves."	N

Samsung's european complaint contact?	"Hey,
Bought my phone in february, it was a preorder. Got it, i wasnt too happy with the instant crash and restart that greeted me. 
Wrote to hungarian customer support wanting to replace the device as i don't trust repairs, especially with a brand new phone. 
They told me to drop it off at a service point to have it ""professionally"" diagnosed. They found no problem with a device that restarts randomly every few hours and the performance is a midrange phone's at best. They damaged my screen. At the service point we made a complaint and was waiting for answers for 2 month. 
Fast forward 2 months, i was living with an iPhone 11 Pro Max for a few days before i backed up data and dropped this shit off at a service point again, because i couldn't even call anyone and the phone got so hot, i couldnt even hold it. 
They finally replaced the motherboard which i was very mad about because i specifically told them i don't want a messed up phone with no IP protection. 
They fucked the backside, all 4 corners where they lift up the back cover, they damaged the frame as well. This time i sent it back right away, didn't even bother to pick it up. 
They sent back a letter where they stated how I was the one damaging the phone and they are not responsible for that. 
I can't move forward with the case as the customer support wont even bother replying to me."	N

My main concern is that *MAYBE* moisture from humidity or some time I had it out in the rain recently caused it. It's not even a year old yet though and IT IS under Premium Care warranty, so it's covered for that sort of damage for replacement/repair.

Hidizs S9 PRO Mini HiFi DAC &amp; AMP	"Hello guys,
Any discussions allowed on DAC's here?
Please remove this if I am am too much of the topic, but I am really desperate.
I just received Hidizs  S9 PRO, that I was waiting for ages. 
As I was very happy with the S3 Pro, I had high expectations.
I opened it and connected my headphones to it and was ready for some heavy listening.
...but alas the short USB-C cable that came with it is not working. I noticed that much that it needs to have the other end that says Hidizs connected to the phone. Then it gives me green light, but the sound only comes from phone speakers :-( .
With other USB-C cable it works somehow, but wont change colors when changing audio quality for example in Tidal.... I am really disappointed.  And the replacement USB cord that I have is about 20cm (7.8 inch)  so bye bye mobility :-(
Please, please if I am doing something wrong let me know. I really hope this is the case.
I really do not know if this is a Samsung thing or Hidizs's problem to be solved.
I tested this with Samsung galaxy S22 Ultra and FE20.
I really do not want to advertise product, so I left out the link. It can be found by googling the topic.

eSIM on corporate Verizon Samsung S22	"I received a new S22 Ultra with Verizon from my company a couple of weeks ago, and would like to add my existing SIM (**not** Verizon) to my phone as a secondary phone number.
So I go to the SIM card manager, I tap ‚Äúadd eSIM mobile plan‚Äù but I don‚Äôt get an option to scan the esim QR code, but I just get a message ‚ÄúNo plans found‚Äù.

Should I switch to a 5G plan for a "free" s22 upgrade?	"I am debating on trading in my s10 for a s22.  If I trade it in now, I will get an $800 credit which essentially makes the s22 free. The caveat is that I would have to sign up for a 5G plan at $70 per month. I am currently paying $35 per month for my s10.
I was told that the s10 is at the cutoff point for this $800 credit. Once the s23 comes out, my phone will essentially be worthless trade in value wise, as the cutoff point will move to the s20.
I realize I will be paying more a month on the new plan. Obviously all the phones and carriers will be continuously migrating to 5G. So I am thinking if I don't switch now, I will most likely be forced to switch to 5G at some point in the future if I want a somewhat decent phone. So if I wait to upgrade I would probably have to pay out of pocket for a new phone.
The value here is clearly in the ""free"" upgrade to the new phone. I am trying to decide if it is worth it to to upgrade and stay current with the newest phones so that hopefully I could trade in the s22 at a later date for the s25 or s26 for free.
Does anyone have thoughts on this?"	N
S22 Ultra will not unlock after 90 days	"As the title says, my S22 Ultea that I bought from Verizon directly on release date will not / has not unlocked after the 90 days has past.

I also tried the old trick of manually setting the date forward to get around the limitation of how often you can check for updates and still nothing. 
I'm aware of manual flashing methods and may have to resort to them, but thought I'd start by asking the community. Don't want to take hours of my time if the real solution is I just need to be patient. So if you have the exact same model as me, have you received June or July updates and I am in fact missing them, or is it possible that there is no issue and May is actually still the newest update AT&amp;T has queued for this model?
For what it's worth, my wife's S22+ (256 GB) also purchased from AT&amp;T *has* received both updates."	N

7hrs SOT base S22 Exynos. Did I win the lottery with this unit or what?	" [Screenshot](https://ibb.co/1GCtywm)
Just got my S22 Exynos 256GB. I was worried by all the hate posts and negative comments about battery life.
I have to change my mind.
Fresh from July update and factory reset. No restore from any backup.
Battery only charged 2 times ever (96% and 94% in this case).
5hrs 4G, 17hrs wi-fi, 120Hz, dark mode, brightness set between 1/4 and 2/4, location on, some FB, some IG, some Reddit, light browsing, heavy Whatsapp usage, 1hr bluetooth sending pics from my old XZ2c, 10min phone call, a bit of YouTube trying to best set the EQ and other stuff.
Still 11% battery left and it will get better and better with the next cycles.
I'm more than happy :)"	N
Best replacement to S22+	"Just like many other people on this subreddit I am having battery problems with my S22+. I have had it for 2.5 weeks now and it has slightly improved, but not has dramatically as I expected from reading/watching reviews.
I have had a Galaxy S4, S6, S10 Edge+, and now the S22+.
I went with the S22+ because it was pretty much the same size as my S10 and i thought it would just be a specs and battery improvement but it feels like I actually have a worse battery now than what I had. I traded in my S10 to get this so I cant just switch back now I am wondering what to do next.

2nd hand market: Flip 3 vs S22 (non-plus)	"Good Day!
I'm currently researching which phone to get trading in my S10e (Samsung is giving great offer for my phone) and just itch for something new, to resell, if in following 6 months something interesting will be released.
I was thinking between S22 and Flip 3 and to my surprise, on 2nd hand market, S22 is priced way higher in my region (Baltics).
ATM official prices are: S22 - 779 EUR; Flip 3 - 799 EUR.
ATM 2nd hand prices are: S22 - 650 EUR; Flip 3 - 530 EUR.
For me personally - this is odd as hell. In last year there weren't many promotions which would drastically reduce price of Flip 3, meanwhile for S22 launch there were some good deals. I can't understand, why the price is so low / why the market might overflow with Flip 3s.
With above in mind, question: how is the situation looking in your local 2nd hand market? Is Flip 3 also cheaper, than S22?"	N

LF: Power bank that supports Super Fast Charging (1.0/2.0)	"Good day!
I recently got a Power Bank ([Anker PowerCore III Elite 19200 60W, Bundle](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FX1V9VP?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)), I thought it would have Super Fast Charging but it DOESN'T have it. I used different cables, even the cable from the 45watt Super Fast Charger from Samsung. The fastest the Anker charges my S22U is Fast Charging.
I'm not sure if Super Fast Charging (SFC) is proprietary to Samsung products. The Anker Power Bank is rated at 60W so it should trigger SFC if it is based on power input.
Does anyone have a suggestion on which Power Bank to get SFC? Whichever brand would do.
I was looking at the [Samsung branded Power Banks](https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/mobile-accessories/phones/20a-battery-pack-dark-gray-eb-p5300xjegus/), it looks like they do trigger Super Fast Charging based on what it says on their website, but they are currently out of stock. Plus, it  says on the reviews that they are not too reliable from what I've read. Can anyone confirm any of this information?"	N

Should i buy the s22 ultra now ( exynos version )?	I am wondering if i should get the phone now or wait for the s23 ultra because i saw on youtube that all the versions will have a snapdragon and also 200mp sensor . So is the exynos really that bad ? Or it's great and i should go for it	N

Is it worth switching from the S21+ to the S22 Ultra?	From reviews and everything I've read online it seems really iffy. I've had my S21+ for over a year and it's been great! I've always liked to upgrade my devices every year or so, but it doesn't honestly seem all that different. When I've upgraded in the past it's been for things I actually wanted. For example, I upgraded from the iPhone 8+ to the LG G8x because of the dual screen. I updated from my LG to my Samsung because, unfortunately, I shattered my LG. This upgrade seems rather useless unless there are some redeeming qualities.	N
s20 to s22 mini ish review	"So I've been contemplating upgrading my s20 to a s22, the small versions. I found a reasonable 2nd hand deal on ebay (¬£400) and went for it, thinking it has to be at least the same as the s20 and not worse?!
I love the new form factor - I don't care for the tall and thin s20. I think the s22 is more reminiscent of the iPhone ratio? The s22's build quality is much nicer than the s20, which just looks and feels a lot less premium for the price. I think my favourite Samsung phone's build quality was the note 9 - that felt premium in the hand and solid too - the metal frame felt much better than all the later Galaxy phones aluminium frames in my opinion.
The camera should have been the biggest difference between the phones but I'm quite often feeling disappointed by the images the s22 produces. I've been taking the same picture in auto and pro modes to see the differences and quite often the s20 just looks sharper and less grainy. The colours are definitely more natural on the s22 though and occasionally the s22 produces better contrast to the s20s washed look. I noticed a detail enhancer button when choosing the 50mp mode on the s22, but it still doesn't make it better than the s20. Night mode is pretty shocking on the s22, it's not great on the s20 but the s20 certainly makes nicer results. So much for all the talk about night photography enhancements! 
Even after typing all this out, this should be telling me to go back to the s20, but I just prefer the look and feel of the s22 and can only hope the software will eventually get better üòï
The phone does feel a little less laggy than the s20 and the camera opens a good bit quicker too when using the double tap on the power button, which is nice.
Anyone else notice worse camera photos after upgrading to this phone?"	N
Suspect online behavior	THE AGENT WAS GREAT, THIS IS NOT A REFLECTION ON THE AGENT, BUT OF SAMSUNG AS A WHOLE.I legitimately ordered a specific s22 ultra 1tb - red, after waiting until it became available. That was may 23. Nearly two months later after weeks and weeks of "delays" (many times without being told there was even a delay), and "samsung" takes it upon itself to cancel my order due to "color unavailability". Even sent me an email that said (actual email content):"CANCELATION REQUEST UPDATEWe were able to successfully cancel the requested items from your order[Then lists my ENTIRE order that was "successfully" canceled]Thank you!"AS IF I MADE THE REQUEST.NOWHERE IN THE EMAIL WAS THERE ANYTHING RESEMBLING AN APOLOGY OR AN HONEST EXPLANATION FOR WHY MY ORDER WAS CANCELED. OR BY WHOM.It was only when i spoke to the agent that I was made aware of the actual reason. Its disgustingly insulting that samsung couldnt at least BE HONEST.I guess more important customers (customers with more money) got their orders, while I was being lied to for 2 months before having my order unceremoniously scrapped and sent an email as if I'm supposed to be happy about it!I was half serious the last time i said this, but the level of... DISMISSAL and DISREGARD samsung has shown me has made it crystal clear that I will be making the right decision to abandon samsung and go with another manufacturer.- I posted this exact message, only a day ago. Not only is the original post gone, but I cant seem to reply to anyone whos had the same or similar experience. If I didn't know better, I would suspect that samsung "moderates"(censors) the more harsh reviews. I also think they may "flag" the account of people who leave such comments to render them mute to the community.And the "solutions" Ive seen for anything are clearly auto-generated blather meant to appear like a live individual is responding.Thanks for nothing on top of nothing samsung!P.s. dont worry, I keep a copy of this complaint (AND the emails that prove you left me hanging before unilaterally canceling my order). Theyre not going anywhere.	N

APTX HD/ADAPTIVE BLUETOOTH CODEC NOT SUPPORTED FOR SAMSUNG GALAXY PHONES!!	How is it that I have a $50 phone that has support for the APTX HD/ADAPTIVE bluetooth codec, but my Galaxy S22 Ultra that cost me almost $1,500 doesn't have support for it? I just bought a pair of $600 headphones that utilizes the APTX ADAPTIVE Bluetooth codec, which is a high fidelity codec, but I'm limited to the lower quality sound of APTX? So for whatever reason, Samsung is limiting their consumers of being able to experience higher sound quality with APTX. Why Samsung? Can't Samung add support to those codecs through a software update??	N

UGH soda in charging poet. What can I do?	"I was getting out of my truck today and had the last bit of my Dr pepper in hand. I dropped sometbing and went to pic it up . When I did, a small amount of dr pepper got in the charging port and I've since had rhe moisture in port earning. 
I've tried cleaning it with isopropyl alcohol as suggested by searching on Google, and put it up against a fan. It says in the mean time I can use a wireless charger. 
My question is, if the wired charge port is ultimately screwed from that, will it fry the motherboard eventually?  I tended to it as quick as I could.

It seems to be a generic brand, but the case is great so far. It feels solid, some texture for grip, and the stand mechanism feels rugged. Time will tell if it lasts.

Advice on S22 Ultra Upgrade	"Hey All,
I‚Äôm looking at moving from a Fold 3 to an S22 Ultra. I purchased the Fold because of the ability to have a tablet in my pocket and used the hell out of it for media consumption and a little gaming. However, the battery in the Fold I can crush in under a day (not exactly surprising given it‚Äôs powering two screens, the outer screen is a major pain to type on, and the pictures I‚Äôve taken on it have been underwhelming. 
Where I could use some help is to get a read on experiences from folks who have had the S22 Ultra for several months. How is it going for you? Are there any issues you‚Äôve run into? How is the phone‚Äôs durability - any issues with it being too susceptible to screen cracks? Finally, how is the battery treating you, particularly for U.S. folks with the Qualcomm chipset. 
Any feedback is welcome. Thanks!"	N

Turned off: 5G, google drive sync, google nearby wifi and bt devices, always on displey (only on tap)
Running bixby routines to ""save enegry"" during night. Basically turning off wifi, data, bt and rest of things and turning on battery saver.

Drop of soda got in the charging port.	I had my phone in hand and was getting out of the car, drink in the other hand. I leaned over to pick up something I dropped and a little dab of soda(Dr Pepper) got in it. So I Googled how to get soda out of a charging port and it said to take a tooth brush and put a dab or two of 90% isopropyl alcohol on it and use that to clean the soda off the port and then take a small damp cloth and dab it in there, then set the phone in front of a cool source of air such as a fan for a bit(I did) and let it sit there for a while (said it could require several hours). I turned my phone off and let it sit in front of the fan for 45 minutes. Then I turned it on, moisture in port warning wss gone, and phone is now charging normally.My question is is it still possible it could still short the system board, or would it have done so while it was still detecting moisture in the port?

Request to add App Lock to the phone's setting	Hi Samsung admin, I don't know if you guy can see my post. I'm new to samsung phone, switched from Oneplus.

I know Samsung have "secure folder", but this is not convenient at all since I usually app lock majority of my apps. I can't just put all my apps inside secure folder like that. Can you guys please create the App Lock to the setting?I know I can simply install an app Lock from the app store, but I don't trust those 3rd party apps when it come down to Lock important apps like (Samsung wallet, cash app, venmo, etc.) Please consider create the app Lock options for us.

Customer service is terrible	I use Xfinity Mobile. On going on thier website to see what phones they feature, the Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra was one of the phones available. So I went on Samsung website and ordered a new Galaxy 22 Ultra UNLOCKED so that it would work on ANY system.Well apparently if you use Xfinity, you need a CDMA and not a GSM card. I was told that if it was UNLOCKED, it would work on any system. WELL.......... That is not true. After an hour and a half on conference with Xfinity customer service and Samsung Tech support and customer service, I was told they couldn't replace my phone with the correct one, that I would have to return and replace it myself. I purchased through Samsung because they offered a free watch with purchase. So not only am I out another week without a phone, I had to return my watch too. All they had to do was send a correct functioning phone and they refused. Samsung customer service sucks. I have returned all my new items, $1200+ and will NOT be reordering. I used to love Samsung, but they don't seem to give a toot about thier customers and thier plyth. I will be going to iPhone, where customer service is better.	N

Galaxy Adventures: New Samsung Life Support Mode For iPhones, Screen on Time, Battery Life	"For context I'm 40 years old, and have used cell phones since I arrived in Japan in 2001.
I now live in Arizona and I'm very happy with my Galaxy S22 ultra, Snapdragon version, 512 gb.
I really wish the memory card slot was still available but we've got the S Pen so that's a decent trade off and I didn't really need the headphone jack because I found amazing Bluetooth headphones and would never go back.
iPhone Life Support Function:
Let's talk about iPhones, so I know a lot of people talk about their S22 Ultra having a weak battery life and they don't have a lot of screen on time, which I understand. I think it's well known that we get less battery life compared to last year's model.
Nearly all of my friends have iPhones, just like little Chinese school girls carry on them, and though they have great battery life that no one can deny, they do occasionally forget to charge their phone.
Just like smokers who forget lighters, iPhone users forget their cables at work and at home.
Even though I have a power bank, it doesn't have the special little plugs for iPhones so that doesn't help my friends because they don't have the right cable.
Wireless power sharing, also known as ""iPhone Life Support Mode"" is available on the S22 Ultra. 
So as your friends iPhone is dying, you can turn this on, and once their phone starts humping yours, their dying phone will begin to charge. 
It's a funny conversation because they look at you like you're so advanced.
Screen on time:
Using an app called Accu battery I'm getting six and a half hours of screen on time, I'm usually set to 75%, which is nearly maximum brightness because that last 25% is hard to tell except when the sun is directly above you.
I'll have to try a test with the brightness at 50% because I believe that most people use this setting by default, I just like things a little bit brighter because it's Arizona and I'm usually outside.
So how hot does this phone get when it's 115¬∞ outside? Very hot.
Battery:
My battery health is still at 98% even though once a month I will completely drain my battery to about 2 or 1% and then fully charge it to 100 to gauge the battery capacity. It's barely changed.
Solutions:
I use a power bank from Samsung and I do not buy the wireless charging version because I would much rather use super fast charging so look for the 20,000 milliamp version of this, it's about $40.
I have never, once, since 2015, been in a situation where my cell phone died because I couldn't find power.
I keep an AC adapter with me and the power bank with me because here in arizona, there are many places where you can plug your phone into charge and having the AC adapter helps keep your phone charged during the day.
I always only charge to 85% because I'm usually near a power outlet but I also have my power bank in case the electricity goes out which trust me, that happened twice in the month of July.
So those of you who say that your s22 Ultra dies on you, just buy a power bank I've been using the same one for years, it's a great investment. It's also nice being the only person who has their phone with plenty of charge at parties to take video and picture as well everybody with their iPhones is running low because they didn't take the time to charge it during the day."

I didn't need to turn the screen or touch anything to know that I missed a text. There was a soft blue light that you could easily see gently blinking. 
Is there any way to simulate on the S22 phones? I know Edge Lighting is a thing. Can I use that? Would it have to be an ""always on"" screen? Would that reduce battery a lot? Would I have to have other clutter on the screen like a clock? 
Just want a simple blue light (Edge Lighting would be great) that doesn't require me to manually check. Thanks so much for any tips and advice."	N

Why are all my notification sounds the same?	I just upgraded from a Note 9 where notifications from different apps would make different sounds and I didn't have to customize them, now all my notifications are the same default sound with no way to differentiate between notifications except turning on my phone.

S22 Ultra - First phone where I'm not worrying about my battery life	I was scared to get this phone because of all the things that have been said about the battery life, but God damn this thing is a beast.

Any long-term users of the base S22?	"I honestly want to see what the long term usage, possibly someone who has used it since release is like on the phone, especially the battery life. 
The only thing keeping me from buying this phone is the battery life, but it has the same battery capacity of my OnePlus 6T, which I find has great battery life as long as I don't have any new power hungry apps running that it isn't used to. 
If the battery life is really so much worse long term than the S22+, then I'll get that one since they'll be around the same footprint, but I'd like something compact. 
Thank you for any help."	N
S22 camera perspective/distortion issue when close to something.	This is a pretty major problem with my and other S22 cameras I've tried, where when you get closer to something the camera stretches the picture in places, messing up the perspective and looking...bad. Is there a way to fix it? I don't wany any kind of stretching most of the time. This is using the main camera, not the selfie camera.	N
Flat edges on the s22/23 ultra?	"A common complaint of the s22 ultra is people wish it had flat edges but i dont think that design would work for the phone at all. I looked at a couple videos of the pixel 6a which is flat and squared, and the note 20 (non ultra) which is also flat and squared.
These phones are ugly. It's essentially just a box stuffed with hardware and it does not good on flagship devices. I'm not a not fanboy but smartphones are limited in terms of having a standout design (from the front at least), you can show someone any android flagship from the front and they wouldn't be able to differentiate between them. This iconic design helps phones to stand out making it easier to market. 
The way I see it samsung could ditch the whole ""note"" form factor by make the corners curved instead of squared.  which I really don't see them doing. Or they could make just the display flat with the unappealing box shape. Or they add some aggressively curved bezels to make the phone look good and be ergonomic
EDIT: I am not in support of curved screens either. I am just discussing how a squared cornered phone with a flat screen will look good."	N
s22 ultra vs s23 ultra	"Currently have my note 10+. Which I absolutely love.

But the s23 may be coming out soon. I'm weighing my options as my  used  10+ value will go down.
What are your guy's thoughts? Should I just go for the s22 now with more value on my 10+? Or hold out and maybe end up paying significantly more?"	N
Podcast and media controla	I'm trying to figure out how to control podcast playback from the pull-down menu and lock screen. Samsung doesn't seem like it plays nice with any third party apps at all on the lock screen (Google clock for exame), but the only app I have playback control from the pull-down menu is audible. Does anyone know how to control Google podcasts or Spotify from the pull-down menu without having to click on media output and scroll through other screens? On the pixel phone you pull down the menu and anything you are currently playing just has controls at the top and it was very convenient. I'm trying to replicate something like that.

(Another) Thinking of switching annoying thread!	"I know, I know.. another of those threads where somebody is asking if they should switch! But humour me, ha ha! 
Cos I'm thinking of switching. And would appreciate all of your feedbacks!  
I'm on the 13 Pro Max and have been really looking into the S22 Ultra the last few days.  
My background is that I have flip flopped between iOS and Android over the years. I used to be a dedicated Samsung user and stuck with them from the first Galaxy through to the S7.. I've tilted towards Apple since but have always wanted to go back to Android and never managed to stick. I often get the new Galaxy and send it back reluctantly. I got the S22 Ultra on release and loved it but there were a few things that led to me returning it and now I'm ready to give it another go.  
I LOVE the design of the S22 Ultra. Whereas I look at my 13PM and it's nice looking but not as nice. It's also much easier to hold than the iPhone and that counts for a lot.  
One thing I miss is Airdrop as I do use my iPad a lot but I think Snapdrop is ok to replace it with. I don't care really about imessage because I use WhatsApp and I can still facetime on my iPad if I need to (which is never too far away from me!) 
One reason i returned the S22 Ultra was the camera. Although pics were excellent, that motion lag when taking photos of my kids/dog (especially in lower light) was awful at launch. Is it much better now? 
The 13PM max also does excellent video. Does the S22U still have that weird jello effect? 
I also returned it because I couldn't adapt from an Apple Watch to a Galaxy Watch. Although now the GW4 runs Wear OS, that's a little less of an issue. Is anyone with a GW4 able to confirm if you can now easily reply to WhatsApp messages using Google Voice dictation on the watch rather than Samsung's please (even when running Wear OS, it made you use Bixby before GA was launched on the GW but now we have Google Assistant, I'm hoping that's changed.) 
Thanks y'all."	N

Now the phone feels lightning fast. When you press the home button, it goes home instantly. When you open an  app, it opens instantly. Everything is super snappy.

Dual SIM in US-- Still need to switch SIMS to access texts?	"Thinking of going back to S22U. Had the phone a few months back and loved it but it had a huge problem when using dual SIM (US variant, ATT physical sim, verizon esim): 
When I had Verizon set as primary sim and a text came in on my ATT sim, I needed to go into settings and switch the primary sim to ATT in order to see the message. And vice versa. It was really annoying and happened a lot.

July's camera update and latest GCam configs - 10x	"Follow-up to my previous thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/S22Ultra/comments/vq6g1l/junes\_camera\_update\_and\_latest\_gcam\_config\_10x/](https://www.reddit.com/r/S22Ultra/comments/vq6g1l/junes_camera_update_and_latest_gcam_config_10x/)
My apologies if this breaks the no photography type post. Just wanted to do another comparison as some people have mentioned issues with the July update and the 10x camera.
Here is a comparison shot of a wild bunny that was in my yard with the stock camera and my AGC GCam setup at 10x. The bunny was standing still. The most noticeable difference should be with the contrast and sharpness of the stock photo, and the fur details from GCam.

&amp;#x200B;
Here is a comparison between the stock auto mode and my AGC GCam setup with the 10x at stock's minimum focus. This isn't true minimum for the lens since both GCam and Pro mode can get closer, but stock will switch to the 3x lens closer than this.

Getting S22U replaced with S Care plus. Performance and camera worse since last 2 updates.	"SD S22 ULTRA 512GB
The camera quality and performance have degraded heavily since last 2 updates. The performance and battery life have also taken a hit. Here is a list of some of the issues. 
1. It slows down every now and then. Like 2 seconds wait for the camera to show up, 2 seconds wait to see app after switching. The User interface lags like this is a fucking $200 phone. It's just bad. 
2. It heats up to the extent of becoming incredibly uncomfortable to hold in hand. This happens for even a small period of gaming or camera use. 
3.The camera app keeps crashing. Especially when I switch to ultrawide. 
4. The video output from the other cameras is really bad. Check samples. 
5.The photo quality from the telephoto camera is really bad now.  
6. To top it off the battery, it's bad, can never last a full day and I have to carry a powerbank always.

Is S22 Ultra worth the switch from iPhone?	"Been considering switching for a while and looking for some real user reviews on the performance and battery life. Half the time people it's incredible and the other half seem to say it's horrible. I've been an iPhone user for the last 3 years but am very familiar with Android so I'm not worried about leaving the Apple ecosystem behind. More so just curious how people have found the battery now that it is mid-late summer. I usually get 3-4 hours SOT but do work long days so really just need it to last me a day without worry. 
I should also include I would be getting it 50% off as my carrier offers that if a device is bought and returned within one week. So it is a 'nearly new' but I find the discount tempting.

Loca glue (liquid adhesive) between glass and bezels	"Not had my s22 ultra long. I was in town today and there was little phone shop. I asked if he fitted glass screen protectors and he said he did. Now I'm massively Regretting it!
He poured a liquid glue onto my screen and I freaked out as he dropped the screen protector on and the liquid began to spread. I asked about the glue getting in the speaker etc. He said it was fine and not to worry.
When I arrived home I found there is glue in the speaker port (earpiece) I managed to remove the glue from the entrance to the speaker by very gently using a pin. I don't know if there's anything deeper inside or not though.
I looked online and a lot of people are saying to avoid this kind of thing like the plague. Tbh, if I knew he was gonna do this kind of process I wouldn't have had it done.
A lot of people are saying that the glue between the screen and bezels can cause damage causing circuit damage, cause the frame to separate etc.
I'm paranoid now and massively Regretting having this done! I never would have agreed to someone pooring a liquid glue all over my screen!"	N

The problem is this isn't new this has been an issue on the Samsung the S22 Ultra Exynos version dating back to April, here's an article talking about this:

Another problem I found is the camera really acts strange in white light for some reason this has only happened once randomly while I was taking a picture and I don't know how I can simulate it again but here's the resulting picture I got from it:

&amp;#x200B;
Overall  this has been happening since the June update (which is when I got the phone), and the July update made somethings better but overall the problem is still there, camera looks good in daylight/outside but whenever I go in my house where the light is dim or white all pictures look noisy and bad like this and the preview is choppy aswell, here's what I tried so far:
\- Clearing cache partition
\- Re-optimizing apps
\- Factory reset from settings
\- Hard factory reset using ODIN
\- Updating to the July update and clearing cache which didn't fix my problem
I really want to love this phone, as it has a lot of great things, great screen, performance and also great camera but for me and a lot of other people the experience has just been bad and inconsistent and I find it hard to convince myself that this is normal for a flagship that I paid 1.3k Euros for, I just hope Samsung addresses this issue with software updates and that it isn't some kind of hardware issue.

Social Media is terrible	"Has anyone else noticed that taking photos in Instagram/Snapchat/Facebook is really bad, the videos are really laggy and it kinds kills the purpose of having a killer camera like this.
I thought they had partnered with snapchat to bring us a fantastic experience - but it turns out it's just really laggy :/ 
Do you think that this will be resolved in any future updates?
I'm using the european version of the phone, maybe it works better in America?"	N
"number your calling is incorrect" - AT&amp;T	"Hi I'm on an international Vaca and went to check my voicemails. Phone yells at me in language of country my cruise is in. Then says ""the number you are calling is incorrect"" in English.
Please help, afaf."	N
Will Samsung Accept my return???	"So. I had upgraded from S21u to S22u directly thru Samsung....after a week of use, I determined the phone was not as performing as well to as S21u, despite the upgrades memory from 128 to 256.  
I contacted Samsung and set up the return.  I'm not sure how it fell out , but I found the Spen on my carpet while vacuuming my home.
Will Samsung still accept this ""return"" if the Spen is missing??  I have read in many places they will accept with no Spen on a ""trade-in"" but can't find anything about returns.
If anyone has any feedback, please let me know!!  Thanks."	N
Regular calls don't work anymore	"Being anl poor man Exynos owner, I was getting used to shitty phone behaviours: unsupported apps, lags, system UI crashing, inferior camera compared to SD, but this gotta be a new low for this shit phone.
It's been a couple of days that regular calls just won't work anymore. I answer the call and I cannot hear anything at all and they cannot hear me either.
Holy shit, I paid 1400 and cannot even make regular phone calls.
Way to go, Scamsung."	N
I've never thought a phone could beat the iphone5 as worst phone in history. But this is it.	"This is my personal review based on my own user experience of using the phone daily. 5 months in, I can safely say this is the worst phone not only of 2022, but of all time.
With the exynos variant, for the price point of 1400, you're greeted with nothing but disappointment.
The lags, the freezes, the SystemUI crashes, the unoptimized apps. Cherry on top, the pictures are WORSE compared to the EXACT SAME PHONE, but sold elsewhere.
Two days ago, the last straw, the phone completely stopped working on regular calls. I can ""make and receive calls"", but no audio comes back from the phone and the recipient cannot hear me. I am stuck using WhatsApp to communicate.
For 1400 euros, you'll be getting a phone which cannot even do the very first basic thing it's supposed to do: make and receive calls!
I decided to give Samsung a second chance after the disappointment of S8+. Never again in a million years with Samsung. This is the last money you'll ever see from me.
I hope this review is helpful to people who are considering purchasing this phone in Europe. I got two words for you:
Stay away."	N
S22 Plus‚Äôs Story Quality is it good ?	Hi guys, I am using iPhone XS Max nowadays but I thinking buy S22 Plus or IPhone 13. So I am wondering about S22 Instagram Story‚Äôs quality. Can anybody share me experience ?ü§î‚ò∫Ô∏è	N
Considering an upgrade to S22+ from S8+	Looking to trade in my old s8+ for an s22+. Main concern, at least what i've seen here, is battery life, but is it really that bad? My s8+ does not have that good of battery life right now as well as being pretty slow which is my main reason for upgrading? Also if anyone could let me know whether there are good upgrade deals coming to verizon soon thanks.	N

Upgrade to s22 256gb for $425 with trade in?	I recently cracked my screen and at close to 2 years old I don't think it's necessary worth it to repair the screen once it's bad enough I have to. Right now Samsung is offering $375 for it as a trade in with cracked screen (I only paid $350 new back in 2020!) and also has a promotion to double the memory to 256gb at no charge. I'm happy with the s20fe but I don't know that I'll ever get this much trade in for it with a broken screen so I feel like it's going to cost me a lot more money later if I hang on to it longer. What do you guys think?	N
Disabling 5G on S22?	"I have a S22+ Verizon model, on Verizon service.
&amp;#x200B;
After a latest update, the ""Band Selector"" app does not work. There seems to be no other way to disable 5g. How can I do this? I get worse service on 5g, and 5g eats my battery."	N
S22 ultra AT&amp;T firmware questions.	"I currently have S22 ultra unlocked version and I am thinking to flash to carrier version so I can have my update fast and some carrier features with 5Ge and video call on dial pad but my question is what are major differences in software wise between unlocked and carrier version.
Does it also has RCS jibe or only AT&amp;T server?

Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G network loss (Rogers Canada)	"For the past month, I've been getting constant 5g connection loss issues, everywhere doesn't matter where I go. 
After reading posts online, users mention to turn off 5g in the mobile networks settings.
To confirm, this does work and LTE has no connection drops however to me this is unacceptable. 
I decided yesterday to bring it in to a Samsung Canada store and the customer service rep told me to get a new sim card. 
I got a new sim card but the problem still persist. Today, went back to Samsung store and this time the same customer service rep said that the motherboard needed to be replace.
The motherboard has been replaced and no more 5g connection drops. 
Hopefully this saves people from researching online for a fix."	N
Is there a setting on S22U to not get vibration notifications when I'm using the phone? I would like to only get notified through vibration when I'm not using the phone	"This is a feature I have on my Gear S3. If the watch knows I'm using the phone then it won't notify me on the watch of any of the notofications coming through on the phone. 
It would be great if there also was on the S22 Ultra. Seems like there should be but idk where to find it"	N
Should I go with this year's s22 ultra or next year's galaxy unpacked?	Not in a hurry right now, holding on my note 10 +, should I buy this year's model or wait for next year?	N
Should I upgrade from the S9+ to S22U?	"I currently have the S9+. It works fine, but with security updates falling by the wayside, is it time to look for a new phone? I found that I can get the 256 gb on samsung.com for $832. I just am not sure if it's worth the price, and would truly be an upgrade, or if I should just wait a few months for the S23 series to come out. 
What do y'all think?"	N
Looking For A Good Wallpaper App (S22 Ultra)	I currently use "WallPix" ... it's ok, it is just very repetitive and a bit childish. A lot of Spider-Man and other super hero wallpapers that I wouldn't put as a wallpaper on my phone. Any good wallpaper apps that you know of...maybe even free websites? Please let me know, thanks.	N
How long will it take until my S22U has learned my usage pattern? Exynos version	"I have had it for 2 days now and I would like to know how long the SOT is but can't since the phone is still learning my usage pattern. I mean it makes sense but I went to work yesterday with around 94% charge and came back with 34%. Better than my old phone (S9) but only slightly I feel. That phone would only have a SOT of 2-3 hours, if that. But even then taking the S9 to work I know it wouldn't last me a whole 8 hours. Which this phone did, but going from 94% to 34% where I just used it for searching up products, paid for stuff and also Snapchat makes me a bit wary. 
I have the Exynos version and I know how much better the Snapdragon version is. But from the reviews I've seen it should be the difference in battery life between the two versions shouldn't be as big as it has been between the two versions before. But right now it kinda seems like it tbh."	N
I have a Galaxy S22 but I also take my iPad everywhere. Should I get Galaxy SmartTags or Apple AirTags?	If I take my phone outside, I‚Äôll also take my iPad, and quickly take it out or put it in a hand bag, which I‚Äôve been doing consistently since I bought the iPad. Needless to say, I generally like using my iPad more than my phone to the points its practically my main mobile device. I spent some time researching both AirTags and SmartTags, and the main advantage of getting AirTags would be the Find My network. I‚Äôm going to transfer to a large college where I‚Äôm pretty sure almost everyone has an iPhone. With the SmartTags I‚Äôd be able to precisely track them with my Galaxy, unlike with AirTags since I don‚Äôt have a iPhone with the U1 chip. It looks like AirTags are the better option. What do you think?	N
S22+ Battery Life VS Pixel 6 Pro	I'm thinking of selling my Pixel 6 Pro and getting a SD S22+. Does anyone know how the battery life between the two compares? I don't play any games, most of my usage is social media + YouTube and web browsing. Any other comparisons between the two is welcome too!	N
S22 Ultra vs S21 Ultra vs 13 Pro	"Hey everyone. I am really in two minds about my s10 successor and I need some opinions.  
So ofc the base s10 is towards the end of its life and I am looking at alternatives. I am especially looking for a phone that will last quite a bit of time. I hate rebuying phones every couple of years.  
Naturally I looked at the s22 ultra, and also the s21 ultra. From what I understood the s21 is not that much inferior in terms of specs and in some areas even better than the s22. And I kinda lean towards that opinion as well. Having used both for a bit the s21 is so much more comfortable to hold. The s22 just feels so bulky.  
Here is the catch: Where I'm from the S21U is more expensive than the S22U. Which is quite stupid. I would love an s21 but for that price..an s22 would make more sense. It's a bit newer so it should last longer than an s21 but still..  
I am also living in Europe and the Exynos thingy just upsets me.  
So here is the kicker. My dad as a 13 Pro Max. And it's quite a nice phone, hence I am considering a 13 for myself as well. I am just a bit anxious to switch to a completely different platform after 5 years of samsung. Plus I really don't like apple and their scummy way of being.  
So this is my situation. Why I am considering each phone, and the letdowns of each. I would love some opinions from you guys and what u think is the most ""meta"" thing rn. Cheers!"	N
S22 battery life	I am currently using Xiaomi Redmi 8 which is fine but I want to upgrade to something better so I think the Samsung S22. Everything looks amazing but my only concern is that It will not last through the whole day. You Tube is full of that. Any advice on what to do? And will be great if someonehas uses Redmi 8 before and can compare the battery life with the S22.	N

Still on May Security Patch and it's near end of June?	Would someone please explain with no useless nonsense why Samsung's primary flagship phone (Galaxy S22 Ultra Unlocked) is on the May Security Patch and it is almost the end of June?

I do not see any logical reason for this.	N

Thank you	N
Wifi constantly drops, "wrong password" even though it was working 20 seconds earlier	I got a Galaxy S22+ and I've never been this disappointed by a phone. My Pixel 4a was hands down better while much cheaper. I'm having many bugs with the android software in the s22+ including one very bad one: The WiFi frequently drops and switches to mobile data, forcing me to manually go in the WiFi settings and click on the WiFi network. The WiFi says "wrong password" even though it has the correct one 100%. Clicking on it connects it back.This has wasted lots of data and been a massive pain, the bug happening over 4 times per day.I searched around and seen many people with the same or very similar issue but nobody from Samsung seems to have acknowledged the issue. The best reply from Samsung we got was "the issue is with your router, change X setting/ update the firmware". We have over 30 devices connecting to the WiFi at my home and not a single one has this issue, so I'm sorry but my router is perfectly fine. I looked and no updates were available for the router and the settings they told me to change were dumb (ie separating the 2.4ghz and 5ghz bands with 2 different SSID or using a static IP on the phone, neither of which worked). I tried doing a factory reset but it didn't help.We've got what, 7 "stability, performance and bug fix" updates since i got the phone and none of them either said what bugs they fixed or even fixed any of the bugs i was having.Other bugs i've been having?- From time to time (once every 2 days), the speakers will have a heavily distorted sound, including for notifications, enough for me and nearby people to look at each other weirdly.- Sometime, all sound disappears from Bluetooth devices, built in speakers and USB-adapter connected headphones. Happens around once per week and is fixed by a reboot.- Sometime, device will refuse to play any media. Media goes on pause and pressing the play button will play 0.1 second of the media and will go back on pause. Will refuse to play any media until i reboot the phone. Happens with any media source i tried: YouTube, Spotify, Netflix, local music player, local video players etc.- Not a bug but why is there no "Guest mode" or possibility to make multiple users on the phone? This is a feature in the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) source code going back to Android 10! Samsung has literally no excuse for not having it when the open source Android code by Google which Samsung's android is built on has it. I can't even pin the phone calling app before lending the phone to someone, as the in-call activity cannot open when you pin the phone app.Samsung, this is very disappointing for a phone that cost me 1500 Canadian dollars.Oh, and the amount of bloatware junk bundled in the phone is insulting. No Samsung, i don't care about Bixby, I don't want your alternate app store that nobody uses or your 10 other Samsung apps of little to no use. Those should either be an Opt-in at phone setup or not exist at all.This is a 1500 rupees phone, i shouldn't deal with any of those issues, my previous 450$ phone had literally no bugs (or at least i didn't experience any of them) and almost no bloatware.

Bluetooth microphone in factory camera app	Good evening,I have a new S22+. I have has Galaxy phones since the S4, it's been pretty much the only smartphone brand I have used.I have noticed with this new phone, that the camera, does utilize the microphone in my Bluetooth headset. Previous phones would do this. Why this is important to me is, every day for work, I take video of customer vehicles to show the issues and recommendations. Our shop started utilizing software for this back in 2018, and I have used 3 different galaxy phones in this time. The previous 2 would use the microphone in my Bluetooth headset which gave me better audio quality for when I narrate videos while I record. It's one of the reasons I started using a headset everyday was because I found that I could get really clear voice quality when I was explaining issues while recording videos.With the new phone, background notices are easily picked up with the in phone microphone and this drowns out my voice when I take videos. This is reducing the quality of the video which makes it harder on our customers and the service advisors because they are not getting as good of explanation with so many distractions.I there a way to make the camera app use the external mic when it is connected on the s22+?

Some things it does great, but besides those things it's been a buggy/laggy experience and the battery life has been bang average to say the least. For a phone this expensive, I am disappointed. 
I had a smoother experience on my Oneplus 8 pro. Updates seem to change nothing and I'm now left wishing I just got a cheaper phone. There is too much of a big difference between the two chipsets samsung put in this phone, and until they put the same chipset in every phone, I won't be buying another Samsung."	N

Battery tips for a festival	"Hi guys, despite being fairly happy with the battery life when I initally bought the phone 2 months ago, I've experienced a few issues lately. Only getting on average around 4h of screen on time and it's dropping by like 5% overnight when I haven't used it at all. I have the battery set to adapative and it's in 'optimized' performance mode.
Anyway, I am specifically looking for tips to preserve the battery as I head to a music festival this weekend. I won't have access to power sockets (although bringing a powerbank), so will need to maximise the battery as best as I can. **Ideally I will still be able to receive calls/texts and take photos**. What are my options and what would be best for preserving battery?
Turn off 4G? Turn off mobile data altogether? How much of a saving could I expect from this?
Power saving mode - not exactly sure what you can/can't do in this mode or how much battery it would save.
Flight mode - guessing this is the best way by far, but obviously would not be able to receive calls or texts, so a last resort plan really.
Any other tips/recommendations for over the weekend would be great as I'm going for 4 nights!"	N

Why is Samsung Galaxy S22+ so fucking slippery?	"Got my S22+ Sunday, removed glass back cover today and holy shit is it slippery.

I don't get how anyone is supposed to use it caseless without dropping it every few weeks at least. 
If I was conspiratorially minded, I would think that Samsung made it slippery on purpose so people would drop it and pay for repairs at their repair centres. 
Either way, I'm keeping the cover on while I wait for case to arrive."	N
S22 Factory Reset On SIM Card Insertion Question	"Can anyone confirm if the S22 does a factory reset every time a SIM card is inserted, or is it only the first time a SIM card is inserted?  In other words, if I want to setup my phone without a SIM card, can I insert my SIM card, boot the phone and have it do the factory reset, then remove the SIM card, setup my phone over the next few weeks, and finally insert the original SIM card?  Or will the insertion of the SIM card at the end of my setup process cause the phone to again do a factory reset?
Edit: it seems this resetting is region specific so not everyone will have encountered it.  For reference, here's one of several Reddit threads that mention that this happens with the S22: https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS22/comments/sy106s/cant_set_up_the_phone_without_a_sim_card/"	N

Fixed 90% of lag/stutter issues	"Hey all. I, like many of you, love my Galaxy S22U but am frustrated with the regular stutters and lags. I have been turning stuff on/off on my phone to try and figure out where the lags are coming from and I have found where nearly all of them are coming from.
First, I will address the 10% of lags which is coming from using Good Lock. I love that app and its modules but using QuickStar and Homeup are some of the biggest offenders (LockStar too). I ran through a gamut of tests of using some or all of those mentioned modules and watched my lag issues disappear. Great job on those Samsung but obviously they aren't perfect yet. If they were, I bet they'd be baked into the OS. I'm keeping them on though because I can deal with the occasional lag for all the cool features those modules bring. 
Now, onto the main event, the cause of 90% of lag/stutters. Ready for it? It's actually quite simple and a long time, very well known cause of lag for all of Android; not just Samsung. It's Accessibility. I was using the Nova ""double tap to lock"" accessibility option. I turned that off and boom, lag gone. It was night and day. I tested it over a 5 hour period and the lags were mostly gone. They were entirely gone when I stopped the Good Lock modules mentioned above too. 
So that's it, just turn off ALL, I repeat, ALL of the accessibility toggles for indivdual apps. Those cool little features are nice to have but they make for a frustrating experience. 
I tend to run the App booster app too and I have a weekly refresh scheduled so that also keeps things running smooth. I have my daughter (and her cheap Moto G Stylus) and my wife's iphone 11 pro on a similar reboot schedule. It really does help keep things running top notch. 
I hope this helps someone out there who is frustrated with their very expensive phone. I also tried this on my Fold 3 and it works just the same. Accessibility for apps is just going to cause lag in the OS; cannot be helped at this time."	N

Where can I find photo and video files synced to OneDrive from Samsung Gallery?	"I've been wondering this since Samsung ended photo and video sync with their own Samsung Cloud and moved users to syncing Gallery items with OneDrive. I can see my photos and videos through the OneDrive app or desktop browser by going to Photos and there, choosing to see photos from Samsung Gallery. However, I can't find the actual files anywhere.
Not truly relevant, but for those who wonder why someone would want to do this, there are several reasons. One is to be able to organize my photos and videos in folders and subfolders (say by year and month). Albums don't cut it, since they don't allow for nesting. Another reason is so that services that connect to your OneDrive and sync contents with something else (like a NAS) also have access to these files.
Anyone know how to do this?"	N
10 MP Telephoto Cameras	So I was just curious, I know the S22 Ultra has two 10 MP cameras, so I assumed they would take 10 MP photos, but when you go into gallery and look at the info of the photo, it says the photo is 3000x4000 which is technically 12 MP's.

Unacceptable micro scratches	I thought this Gorilla Glass Victus Plus was supposed to be better than the prior version but I'd argue otherwise. I don't use my Pixel 6 Pro any different than my S22U, but my S22U seemingly has multiple micro scratches all over the front screen. This is quite unacceptable in my opinion, as even my Note 10+ didn't have this many micro scratches on it.

Moisturized Thumb.	"Love this phone. But this finger print scanner is garbage.  I've had allot of phones, most recent was the V60 which had a flawless scanner under any and all circumstances.

Slap a dab of moisturizer on thumb and all is right with the world again.

I thought about getting a new note 20 ultra instead but those are still $1000 for some reason. The last good note perhaps.
I tried the plus model but the curved corners ruin the movie watching experience for  me. The 1080p screens look awful. I can't explain it but a 1440p screen set to 1080p looks 10x better than a native 1080p screen to my eyes.

How To Payoff and carrier unlock my S22 Ultra while keeping my $800 Galaxy Trade in Credits	So I have a S22 Ultra that I got back in March. I traded in a Galaxy S4 to get the $800 trade in credits over 3 years. I know I've seen people mention that once you start getting the credits you can then Pay off the balance of the phone and keep getting the credits. Then ask for the phone to be unlocked and you will still keep the credits. Is there anything that is tricky or that I should be aware off if I do this? I like the S22 Ultra but I think I'd like something smaller and I was just seeing what my options might be in the fall if I bought a phone in cash later. I know if you pay it off and try to finance another ATT phone then the credits will stop so I wouldnt do that.	N

switching from an iPhone 12 to a s22 Ultra or S22+?	"which would you recommend? 
i‚Äôm a huge nerd, so I love all the little extra features the s22U comes with. the extra cameras, S pen, and that big display seem really nice to have. 
the s22+ is just a tad smaller, and doesn‚Äôt have the features mentioned above, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a slouch. it‚Äôs still the newest flagship samsung phone.
my main reasoning for considering the s22+ was the size. many people on this sub say that they traded their S22U for the s22+ solely for ergonomics and they won‚Äôt look back. i have normal-ish size hands; my iphone 12 is a perfect size, but since it‚Äôs my first samsung phone, i was thinking about going big or going home.

Lags, system UI crashes, camera taking poor quality pictures, poor battery life, displaying static and flickering (adilmittedly it only did it once but I'm pretty sure that ain't normal)
Got it back the same day by mail delivery with the following report:
No issues found.
The only thing they changes is to wipe all my data and reset the phone to stock settings. This is the 7th hard reset since I bought this phone.
So, if anybody still considering buying exynos, take this in consideration.
Even Customer support says that lags, stuttering, poor pictures, poor battery

Want to upgrade to 5G phone with dual sim that works in US/Korea, considering the S22 Ultra. Thoughts? Experiences?	"Hi Reddit! I'm posting here because I've run out of options and have consulted every possible other avenue I could find. 
I recently relocated to South Korea and want to upgrade to a 5G phone with dual sim capability, as I have to keep a US phone line open for business purposes. (And yes, I have considered just having 2 phones but it'd be nice to only have 1 device if possible.) Seems like dual-sim phones are generally not available in the US or Korea, so I've been researching unlocked/global models and the Samsung Note 22 Ultra ( **SM-S908B/DS)** is currently one of the options I'm researching. I'm also considering the Note 20 and S21 models.   
I'm currently stuck at checking frequencies and whether or not this model would work in the US and South Korea. I've tried consulting both Samsung US/Korea and LG U+ (my Korean carrier) and they've been incredibly unhelpful.

Frankly though I have no idea what I'm looking at XD; I was also trying to learn about GSM vs CDMA but I've been reading that if the phone is quad band it will work in most countries and that the difference between CDMA/GSM is less important with the widespread use of 4G/4G LTE and 5G. So I guess this means as long as the phone is GSM I don't have to worry about it?

Since I'm already overseas and won't be returning to the US anytime soon, I'm looking to purchase a global S22 Ultra on Amazon, but since it's an expensive purchase and I'd like to avoid the hassle of making an international return, I was curious if anyone has been in a similar situation as I am and if the S22 Ultra worked out for them. Or maybe I should just give up and get a phone here and have 2?   
To summarize:  
\- Will the S22 Ultra (SM-S908B/DS) work in the US (Tello or Google Fi) or South Korea?   
\- Has anyone with this model currently use the dual-sim feature, or have in the past? Does it work properly?

Can't Get Replacement Device on Exclusive Color	I pre-ordered a graphite S22u 256GB back in March, and waited about 5 weeks for it. About a week or so ago I cracked it. I contact Samsung Care (Asurion) to get a replacement and they tell me that they have to send me a black one as the graphite is no longer produced. I ask if they can just fix my current phone and they say no, the only option os to send me a new phone. They also tell me that there are no authorized repair locations near me, or in Houston, TX, which is strange to me because I live literally 5 minutes from a uBreakIfix by Asurion , and Houston has a Samsung store, if not multiple. Also strange because uBreakiFix has told me that they fix S22s using genuine samsung parts. Anyone else have this issue or know any ways to fix my current phone ? I pretty much refuse to go with a black phone after I've waited all that extra time to get a graphite one.	N

US S22 Ultra not supporting 5G in Europe	Hey all, I purchased my S22 Ultra (Snapdragon) during my holidays in the US only to find out that it doesn't support the required band for 5G in Europe (I live in Ireland).

S22 Ultra lens question	"Hi there!  
I'm noticing that when shooting video at "".6"" lens, and when shooting still photos with the "".6"" lens (both on the rear), the FOV is different depending on if it is photo or video.  
I'm trying to shoot some footage for camera tracking and I need as much info as I can get re: lens, focal length, sensor size, FOV, etc, and I'm a bit confused as all the tech specs seems to indicate there is only one wide and one ultrawide lens.  Can anyone chime in on this?  Thanks so much!"	N
Considering a sidegrade from x80 pro to s22 ultra.	"Is it worth considering? I am concerned about shutter lag, battery life and low light photos. I am a very very heavy user. I have to charge the phone atleast once a day. The x80 pro gives me 7-8 hours SOT (camera, games mostly wild rift, whatsapp some calls and browsing with Netflix running on pip). I'm curious to see if the screen brightness matters, stylus matters, os interface (i tend to turn off animation for zippy speed), thermals. How long does it take to charge up to full while using the phone. I currently replenish my phone back to full in 15-30 minutes.
I don't particularly have an issue with my phone currently but I've been offered a sweet deal in the s22 ultra. But I've had really bad experience with samsung flagships before...(s7 edge and s8.) They BOTH had charging moisture issue, suffered absurd lag over time...and the battery was unusable after a while ....when all reviews praised them... probably Exynos).. I'm reconsidering samsung because they are allowing sd models in my country.
The photos on the x80 pro are phenomenal and I'm not a huge fan of zoom photos...it's the main and ultrawide i care about.
It's the videos I'm curious to see if they are genuinely better..(specifically for skin tones). I currently have to enter pro mode and do my videos to customize white balance colour tone and other settings which brings excellent results...but if I can manage to get even a little lower quality without having to do so without compromising on photos and charging !"

S22 now or wait?	"In Canada, the S22 is on sale for $804 ($628 USD) plus you can receive a $200 credit for additional purchases (must be used before Aug 31).
I'm torn between waiting for the Pixel 7 or S23 or just getting the S22 now. 
My biggest concern is battery life and heat, as well as cost. 
The Pixel 6 costs $800 so it is likely the 7 will as well. However, I feel like Samsung does more promotions and that might be one of the reasons to go with their smartphones. 
I have heard mixed reviews about the battery life being decent/okay to just terrible. I also heard about heating issues because of the SoC.

s22ultra Not worth the hype and customer service tokd several lies	Horrible am regretting trading in my S9+I got this June 3rd. At first It felt flimsy but was use to a bigger case. Than I tried to run a pop up window and do something on the internet which my 9+ never had issues. This one for supposedly being the best chip in a phone I'm sorely disappointed. The battery doesn't stayed charged very long. They say it takes at least 10 to 15 times to learn. I don't see how that is. I have a case on it it dropped one time and tge back corner of the back of the phone is now cracked. Which let me tell you my S9+ was way stealthier. On top of all the issues with just the ordering itself they had all the info my carrier had for the same promo even still had they offered financing through them. My order e wouldn't go over to the cart their team couldn't get it to go over to the cart. The only way they could if it was an unlocked phone finacing through samsung. Told me dont worry it will be corrected regardless.Well it hasn't been they haven't cared to check up i was exoecti n g a call from a supervisor that never cane. And now I'm left with a phone that can't even keep two windows up without stalling. Battery sucks and the screen is poor quality. I miss my s9+ and next time won't go with Samsung they have done nothing.but lie and I have all the chats and email to support it.	N

Is that a feature or a bug?
I found out about this while playing with a filter on TikTok where there are random movie posters. I tap to make a new poster appear, and sometimes I can tap a bit hard when I'm playing with this kind of filter, since it's not to take a picture or to focus the image.

does anyone else use S22 Ultra and an IPhone?	"I really like the S22 Ultra but I still carry an IPhone 13 Pro Max too.  Here's why:
1)  I can't give up IMessage; professionally and socially it's too important. I would get left out of group chats.  I understand this isn't an issue for everyone depending on whett you live and what you do but I think it's important everyone know how big a deal this is.  However there are a few third party tools that claim to address this that im curious about.
2)  Alll my other devices are Apple.  I'm not sure how  much this matters though.  I used to think that messages working cross device really mattered but I think I can more or less do this with Android and I'm actually really liking Windows 11 on my Mac.
3)  I have to keep an iPhone for Apple Watch.  From what I've seen so far, Samsung Health doesn't come close to Apple Health.  That said I could still make my S22 Ultra my primary phone as I have a cellular watch.
4)   I really like Apple Care. In general i'm not a big fan of  of warranties but apple cares is inexpensive and convenienent.  i recently broke the back glass of my iphone got it fixed in store for 29 bucks.  Need to look into Samsung Care but they don't have thr store network. 
5)   I have lingering concerns about Google and privacy.  I've seem many Android fans naively say ""Apple is just as bad"" when really nothing could be further from the truth.  Apple sells consumer products and services and I'm their customer.  Google sells advertising and consumer profiles and I'm their product.  I don't see this changing unless their split up and their business model changes... until then I have to work around Google.

Could it be that having more physical pixels is always better? Even when upscaling the image? Kinda like how a 1080p movie on a 4k TV still looks better than a 1080p movie on a 1080p TV?
This got me thinking that refresh rates are actually a gimmick. You forget about them after a day. Your brain adjusts to the speed and it becomes the new normal, whereas a 1440p screen will always look good 5 years later.
we don't have to choose with the s22 ultra but if we did, which would you pick?

Telegram pop up notifications	Hello lovely people. I am wondering if there's a way to make Telegram just have notification icon, without the pop up comes about. Thank you in advance. Sorry I am on mobile	N
Notifications?	"When I clear the notifications from the pull down screen it clears all the bubbles off the app icons. Idk if that's normal but I came from an iPhone and it didn't do that.

Is there any way to change this setting or is it just something I have to adapt to?"	N
Can we please talk about the aggressive post processing on this phones?	I have been buying Samsung phones since the original Galaxy, I've owned almost every evolution and most of the notes. The last few years of Samsung phones have gotten completely out of control with the post processing, and every time I pay up hoping it will get better. Is there something I am missing? These are sections from a photo I took a few feet away from the subjects. Is everyone else getting this cartoon like post processing or is it just me? How do reviews rate this as a good camera when this is the result? I am so disappointed again. S22 ultra exynos 512.	N
Themes icon on S22 Ultra	"Hi there good people.
&amp;#x200B;
Been using Samsung since S3, upgraded to a few Samsung phones, and now a proud owner of the S22 Ultra.
&amp;#x200B;
I been using the same theme pack since I discover it. Soothing to my eyes.
&amp;#x200B;
Every single phone that I used it on (S6edge, A9 2018, Note9) I can confirmed that the Clock and Calendar icon reflecting the correct current time and date of the month.
&amp;#x200B;
&amp;#x200B;
But on S22 Ultra, nothing works other than the original default theme.
&amp;#x200B;

August 2022 Update - I'm in the UK and just installed it
Disabling location permissions for Bixby Voice - I checked location permissions and it was constantly asking for location data.  To check this search for ""Permissions Usage"" in settings, it will tell you what apps are requesting what and when. On a site note, 'System UI' always wants location info, but it doesn't seem to drain battery.
Disabling location based Bixby routines.

weird battery drain issue	"Hello,  
I have the base s22 Exynos, after a couple of months of unusual standby battery drain issue I finally pinpointed the issue but have no idea how to move forward from here.  
I noticed that I have a big standby battery drain only when connected to a mobile network (regardless of mobile data, -13% overnight). the thing is I have two SIMs, and the drain is caused only by my main SIM. Even going to my second SIM's county where the main SIM is roaming, it's still the cause of the drain. 
* I tried switching to a different sim but in the same carrier (Lycamobile). And the drain is still there, so it's not a faulty SIM. 
* I also tried to switch to 3g and nothing has changed (usually I'm on LTE, no 5g)
* I tried changing the slots of the sims and its not it
my last resort is to switch carrier (not sure if it will help) but this seems such a weird issue since I didn't have this issue with my previous phone and the same SIM.  
I'd appreciate any ideas on how to continue:)"	N
S22+ Rattle noise	"Hi!

Problems with the new June 2022 security update. (SOLVED)	My phone model is the Samsung S22 Ultra.Hey so I updated my phone recently to the latest patch and I've had several issues after updating, for example;1. My phone screen turns itself on and if I try to turn it back off it repeatedly turns itself back on.2. When I go to the gallery and tap on a photo, my phone automatically scrolls through them all until it reaches the end of the album.3. When scrolling the notification bar down (after unlocking my phone), it almost immediately scrolls back up again.Now I've tried multiple google searches and I've contacted Samsung support twice and nothing has helped me. Are other people experiencing this or am I the only one who is facing bugs after the latest patch?	N

I use GPS 2 hours a day, apps &amp; web browser at work, daily workouts with music/video/Instagram.

12 256gb The phone is perfectly functional and ""working"" as intended, as even customer service said to me. Not a dent or a scratch.
I have been owning this phone for 5 months. How much could I ask for?"	N
Dex (wired to LG TV through HDMI) issue since August update done the 30th july	"Hi, it's been a long time I didn't connect my S22U to my screen, now I have time I wanted to start 4th season of Stranger Things, but my phone refuses to start Dex. I'm using an adapter bought on Amazon 4 years ago for my Note 9, everything worked like a charm with my S22U using this adapter until last use of it in may. 
Last week, I tried another cable for Dex and it worked too, but now, it's the first time I try to start Dex since the august update I did last saturday. 
Anyone else is facing the same issue ? If someone faced it and solved it, how ?
Something really strange in this situation is that when I plug my charger (25W) in the adapter to charge it while trying to connect to screen, the phone thinks I plugged a 45W charger I guess (""super fast charging 2.0"" instead of ""super fast charging""), so I'm wondering if it can be due to USB-C to screen adapter (it was not that expensive, 15 euros, maybe bad quality at last) or the HDMI cable (which is new, bought in january and only used 2 times in may after my old previous one stopped working correctly).
Have a nice day

Assigning different sound notifications to different apps	"Hi all,
I‚Äôve looked at a few guides to attempt to do this, but so far nothing‚Äôs worked for me.
What I‚Äôm trying to do is have one sound for assigned for receiving an sms, a different one for email, and another for most other apps etc.
So far it‚Äôs one sound for everything, or nothing for all.
Moved up from a Note 9 two days ago, &amp; so far very impressed with the S22 ultra. The Note 9 had one specific sound for sms, one for gmail, and for other apps (eg. FB messenger), it seemed the apps came with their own default -and individually different- sounds.
Hope there‚Äôs someone out there that can offer me a way that actually works, because the guides I‚Äôve looked at haven‚Äôt - (or maybe it‚Äôs a case of me not actually ‚Äòworking‚Äô when I‚Äôm trying to get it right?)."	N
Icon Packs?	"Hi
The themes, icons and all are fine from Samsung it self, but man its sad to see that only their apps is changed with the icon packs you can choose from.  
I've seen lots of nice icon packs in the play store, but it does not work on the S22U..  
I know there is an app called ""Good Lock"" but it does not work for me. ( I live in Sweden ).  
Maybe there is something else to do that lets me use those icon packs?  
Anyone have any experience with this?"	N

Vibration bug	"Hello all,
I face vibration bug on my S22 Ultra (256gb, exynos, august patch) since launch. I use handy feature called Notification reminders (you can find it in settings, notifications, advanced settings).

Do you also face it?

s22 ultra was too sharp in the hand	I'm staying with the s21 ultra for the long haul. Why did Samsung redesign it to look like the note? It's only a minor improvement on the hardware and a decrease in ergonomics. But it has the stylus built in. Not that I use it often.	N

Can you still customize Text	OK so I feel really dumb I've looked all over & can't find an answer. So I just switched from the note10+ to the s22 ultra I did a bunch of research but didn't even check to see if I could still set a custom photo for each of my text messages. I loved this feature it made it so easy to know who I was talking to just by the background especially when bouncing back & forth between text. Does anyone know how to set photo background on the text messages on the s22 ultra? Any help would be greatly appreciated.	N

S22U from Note 20U?	Surely many here have upgraded from the Note20U to the S22U. Was it worth it? With August 10 around the corner, I find myself significantly more interested in the GW5 (Pro) than the Fold 4. I have a Note 20U, Fold 3 and GW4 Classic. I moved back to an iPhone 13 Pro as my daily because I found the watch unsuitable for my use case. It's hard to reconcile the Z Fold 4 being such a significant upgrade from the Fold 3 (and no leaks so far have suggested otherwise.) BUT, if the watch were compelling I'd definitely get the S22U as my daily- if it's demonstrably better than the Note 20U. I've read reviews and watched a few comparison videos- nothing conclusive. Have you all found it to be a worthwhile upgrade?	N
Tried gaming for the first time on S22 üò±	"Battery depreciated by 37% in about 40 minutes of game play. Woof. Better have a charger or a power bank handy if you are going to play anything graphic intensive.  
It was bad enough for me to uninstall COD mobile even though I like that game quite a bit.. that seems to be quite a bit of power sapping even for a graphic heavy game-- didn't even have the HD resources downloaded either. 
Still a good phone but I just think the battery is too weak to game much st all on it."	N
Lowest volume still too high.	"I Just picked up an s22+ and I find the lowest volume a bit too high. If I'm in bed and can't sleep I sometimes use my phone(I know, wrong thing to do) but don't want to wake my wife and son. My s21 it replaces definitely went lower. Is there any solution to this?

Privacy strategies and tips for switching to S22 Ultra	"I'm interested in strategies or tips from people with knowledge/interest in security/privacy in general (and Android/Samsung/S22 Ultra in particular) and how they recommend setting up the phone to reduce Google/Samsung data collection. This is primarily for people in North America and Europe which have more advanced economies in data collection and marketing.
I realize this might also apply to r/Privacy but I'm curious about S22 series specifcis.  To slow down at least some of the trolls (this is Reddit after all) let's acknowledge that some dqta collection is always going to occur and that's OK.  But just because you can't stop ALL data collection doesn't mean you shouldn't minimize it where you can.   I'm talking about what the average person might do to reduce exposure, NOT hiding from the government or law enforcement or an drastic measures or compromises (GrapheneOS)... I'm just talking about routine Google, Samsung, Facebook, etc. data collection.
The problem of course  is what seems like reasonable, innocuous, or even beneficial data collection today can be misused or even stolen tomorrow.  The only way to prevent the abuse of information is to limit collection in the first place.
The kinds of things I'm curious about...
Do you use multiple Google accounts, and how do you segment them?  Do you turn off data collection in each Google account? 
Do you use a Samsung account, and if so, what do you allow or disable in terms of collection?
Do you use Samsung apps, Google apps, etc. and why?  For example, Samsung or Google Contacts, Calendar, etc. 
Third party apps for disposable emails, phone numbers, etc.? 
What Samsung and/or Google apps do you uninstall, disable, or turn off.  I assume EVERYONE who's gotten this far removed Google apps Chrome, Gmail, etc.? 
Do you use a secure Folder, Dual Messenger, or other similar apps like Parallel Space and if so for what? 
VPN?  Split tunnel?  DoT/DoH?  Mobile data only apps?
I feel like there are strategies I'm missing, like maybe a sperate account for each Google Service (I don't do that and haven't thought it through just throwing it out there).
Thanks in advance!"	N

Fold 3 -&gt; S22U?	"Hey everyone, last year I upgraded from my s10e to the fold 3 which was on sale at best buy for 1k.  I've been loving the experience for the most part but as someone who values longevity (I'd still be using my s10e if I didn't ruin the screen and if the battery still held up), I keep sitting here wondering when my screen is gonna crack and the thought of continuing a $10+ dollar a month subscription to Samsung premium care + a $300 dollar deductible annoys me.  Not to mention I've been getting back into running and let's just say the fold 3 isn't the most compatible device for that application given it's trying to pull down my shorts while doing so.  There are a bunch of other reasons but my primary reason for wanting to move back to a traditional phone is durability and practicality in general. 
Do you guys think I should go ahead and swap out phones or just wait?  The durability anxiety and potential to eat costs if I do get unlucky enough to have the screen die until upgrade time does worry me."	N

Battery charging and percent issues.	"- The phone's percentage randomly started decreasing every second very fast, phone wasn't even hot. Restarting made the battery 99%.
- I completely killed the phone hoping that would fix the battery monitoring, and charging was abysmally slow on the supported super fast charger (it said it was super fast charging too). Restarting made the battery go from 9% to 99%, leaving me unable to charge the phone and actually use it.
- Wiping cache did not help. Hoping there is some easy fix before I factory reset.
Update: 
- The device was reported at 9% when it was charging extremely slowly. After restarting it was at 99% as stated above. Right now it's sitting at 80% so it has used 19% so far lol. Since it was at 99%, it has been 1h59m screen on and 11h screen off."	N

‚Ä¢  is the screen smoothness consistent while multitasking ? my note 5 sucks alot at this and i really need to so multitasking, sometimes i even use split screen.
‚Ä¢  is the battery that bad im hearing about ? my note 5 gets me 5 SOT with a new battery and a custom kernel, anything less than that is unacceptable. but im talking about very light use, when i start a game it doesnt last more than 2 hours. if the s22 can get 5 SOT with 1 hour of heavy gaming is good.

Is there any way to export and import these settings so (with the files in the same path) every app or contact still gets their own Notification sound or Ringtone?BTW same could be said for WhatsApp and probably other messaging apps, but those settings are in-app so if the app doesn't sync it I suppose there's no easy way.

Worst company ever!	I traded in My N20 ultra, and spent 285.00 on the device. It worked fine until about 2 months in. My device has been remotely locked and I have tried several times to get Samsung to unlock it. I followed all the rules outlined in the terms and conditions yet they claim to have not received my phone trade in and now expect me to track it down. That's not what is written in the terms. I have been a loyal customer for 7 years and now they illegally locked my device in an attempt to bully me out of another 1000.00 I would never recommend any Samsung product to anyone again.	N

Moon/Scorpius/Cygnus	Pinched and resized from original snapScorpius before editsScorpius after editsCygnus with crude delineation to assist with the preceeding image. Brightest star to the left of the head is Vega.A little bit of a challenge tonight as for some reason it took a little longer than normal to get into focus, Aperture for the moon Shor kept sliding and bouncing off the "best shot" circle. But did what I could.Before and after editing of Scorpius overlooking my house. Shot in nightmode with some edits in both the native gallery and Adobe Lightroom. Cygnus just shot in nightmode with a minor tweak to sharpness in the native photo editor. Got a copy with a crude markoff for Cygnus as it may be hard to delineate, but once you see it, you can sorta picture a swan/goose figure. I use Stellarium to help guide me to the constellations.In the same image with Cygnus you can see a polygonal shape to the upper left-- that's the head of Draco, a very large constellation thst resembles a dragon. And over to the lower right of Cygnus, there is a smaller polygonal cluster-- that is Delphinus.	N
Beta S22 Ultra	How the **bleep** does the United States not get the beta version of Android 13 today instead samsung releases it in Germany and that's it...I don't see why we are excluded from it.	N
Micro SD card Gone	As someone who is fully invested in Samsung I have the Note20 ultra, Galaxy Watch, Galaxy buds pro, and the galaxy flex book. I am disappointed that the SD card slot is removed. Internet speeds and cloud storage speeds aren't fast enough to send and retrieve large amounts of data. What set Samsung apart was the fact that they had expandable memory. The Galaxy S6 didn't have one and it was disappointing. Especially in today's where everything is a subscription. It feels that you guys forget about the customer and worry about fattening your pockets. Most of us don't want cloud storage. I enjoy taking my sd card out my phone and putting it in my laptop and transferring everything I need to transfer. Especially if I'm in a area that might not have wifi. Apple users are Apple users. Samsung users are Samsung users don't blur the 2. We are here for a reason and you guys are slowly taking those reasons away and look more like the competition instead of yourselves.	N

Super Slow Motion - Any Way to Disable the Lead In/Out?	"Just upgraded to an S22+ and playing around with the features, and I know I must be missing something simple here but can‚Äôt figure it out.  I understand the camera can only record for about a half second at 960fps, however is there any way to do so without the slow down/speed up effect at the beginning/end of the video (ie just record 480 frames at 960fps and let me sort out the slow motion on my computer)?  I can obviously edit them out, but if there‚Äôs a way to eliminate that unnecessary step it‚Äôd be quite useful since I can‚Äôt imagine any situation where I‚Äôd want them there.  Not a huge thing as there‚Äôs not likely a lot of opportunities to use clips that short (at least without some sort of external triggering mechanism), but just curious that there‚Äôs not more settings to tweak exactly how it works. 
Open to other video apps that give more control over that if it‚Äôs just a limitation of the default Camera app!"	N

SUPCASE Unicorn Beetle Pro	"I have had this case for my S22 Ultra for almost two weeks now and really wanted to love it, but I have been having issues with tempered glass screen protectors lifting on the edges (went through all 3 of my Mowei ones) and also wireless charging is a miss.   
When put on the charging stand (15W wireless charger which should charge Samsung phones at 10W) it does recognize the phone and starts charging, but only to stop after a minute or so. Without the case the charging stand works just fine.

A nice article on why memory management is soo much better on the Android 13 beta with multi-gen LRU enabled	"I've personally noticed a massive decrease in lag using 2GB of RAMplus on Android 12. I was going to disable it entirely with adb until I upgraded to the Android 13 One UI 5 beta and read this article. Immediately after updating, I noticed a huge performance increase. Apparently, memory management has improved dramatically in Android 13 with a bit of Linux sorcery called multi-gen LRU. I can tell a difference in virtually every aspect of my user experience.   
""According to Google‚Äôs fleetwide profiling, multi-generational LRU yields an '**overall 40% decrease in kswapd** \[the kernel daemon that manages virtual memory\] **CPU usage**,' an '**85% decrease in the number of low-memory kills at the 75th percentile**,' and an '**18% decrease in app launch time\[s\] at the 50th percentile**.'

Video capture sound distortion	"Hello, two days ago i was on a music festival and have made alot of videos. After checking them at home, i noticed that almost all of them have a strange distortion ""pop"" sound at exactly the same time stamp (3-4s). After checking my older videos alot of them have the same distortion at the same time stamp. My microphones are working without problems (checked with sound recorder and diagnostics tool).
After playing abit with the settings i think that the culprit is the ""zoom-in mic"" function. Since i disabled the function i don't have the distortion sound in the videos anymore. 
I was even looking for other video captures of other people, and have noticed the same sound at the same time stamp 3-4s)
A random video on reddit with the same distortion:

and my video from a festival with the distortion:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPq_wK5uJsI
Anyone else noticed the same distortion in their videos? Could someone else test this too please?
I noticed that the louder the surroundings, the louder the sound (hence why the video from the music festival has a louder pop).

Got New S22 Ultra - Any tips/Advice?	"Just switched to S22 Ultra - 512 GB, Indian (Snapdragon version) from my Galaxy Note 9 which served me really well for 3.5 years!

Does 60hz even make sense anymore to save battery?	"With Samsung's 120hz implementation its adaptive from 1hz -120hz, but with Standard 60hz its ""locked"" to 60hz and not ""variable"" from 1-60hz.
So whats the point anymore? It basically works out the same or actually worse for 60hz. For instance if you watch alot of YouTube, anime or videos at 30hz, then being locked at 60hz drains more battery than adaptive 120hz that can dial down to match the 30hz.
Isn't this a huge mistake in implementation?  I am actually asking for real. 
A better implementation would be a refresh rate ""cap"" to 60hz instead  of a locked 60hz so you have adaptive 1-60hz as well. This would save more battery for sure than adaptive 120hz.
Is there a hardware reasoning like the panel technology why this was not done or just lack of foresight ? I hope this can be fixed in software as i rather use 60hz than 120hz but only if i actually get battery gains."	N

I flashed One UI 5 Beta on a W variant in Canada	"Hello, just wanted to share my experience on one UI 5 and how I did it for those that are looking to do the same. Note that **YOU DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK, IM NOT RESPONSABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE.** 
One UI 5 has been pretty good, way better than one UI 4.1. I don't have any lag or stuttering anymore and social media apps don't lag while using the camera, interms of battery life I haven't used it enough to notice a difference. note that when updates come out you might have to side load it and when stable comes out you would have to flash back to stable release.

11. once CMD is assigned to that folder, input **( ADB reboot recovery)**
12. phone will restart into recovery, scroll down with volume buttons to apply update from ADB
13. on your CMD windows input **( ADB sideload** [**update.zip**](https://update.zip) **)**

About the new beta.	"* Nothing will get done if you report them here.  You need to report all issues in the Members app at the very least
----------
* If you install the beta by other means besides the members app then keep in mind you will have to side load every update until the full release comes out
----------
* If you are abroad, chances are unless you have a simcard from the country your phone was purchased, you won't be able to get the beta the normal way and will need to side load 
----------
* If you join the beta and manually flash yourself back to stock, instead of opting out. You will still need to opt out in the app or risk not getting any updates.  
----------
* Going back to the non beta 12 builds require a factory reset 
----------
* Pay/work/banking apps might not work
----------
* Report all issues in the members app. Can't stress this enough, I've seen issues fixed as fast as the very next build because of timely reports
----------
* You are basically volunteering to test this so the final release is better.  So don't expect perfection and don't waste your efforts by not reporting in the Members app."	N

Inconveniences with dual SIM and dialer app	"Hello, bought S22 Ultra few days ago and I'm still getting used to it. I'd been using S9+ for 3.5 years, and gotten quite used to it over the time period, so now I'm facing some inconveniences while adapting to the newer OneUI on the S22 Ultra, and I'm wondering if some of you can help me out with the following two problems:
1. I use two SIM cards, the private one and the office one. Now, you can choose the prefered SIM card on this phone, just like on S9+, but the problem is that I can't really choose the prefered SIM card for calls. See, on the S9+ when I chose the private SIM card as the prefered one for calls, when I would swipe-to-call the recent contact in the phone app, if the contact had been called previously via private SIM, it would initiate the call immediately, while if the previous call(s) were done by the office SIM, the app would only then ask me via which SIM do I wish to initiate the call. So on S22 Ultra I need to choose every time for every contact via which SIM card to initiate the call. If I set the default SIM card in SIM card manager, the option to call from the other SIM card completely disappears from the phone app! Like I have only 1 SIM in my phone. It's very inconvenient for me, and I guess there's not much to do about it, but I would appreciate if anyone here experiences the same issue, and has come to some solution.
2. In the phone app, when dialling the ,,name"" of the contact by numbers, the results would appear in the alphabetic order (I think). On the S9+, if you dialled one contact frequently this way, he/she would start appearing on top of the list in the next searches, which I think is very convenient, but that's not the case on S22 Ultra. Is there any option/setting to set this?
These issues are really minor, and this is a great phone, but since I've used this very same but older UI, it doesn't make sense to me to remove said features. OneUI 4.0 is definitely an upgrade in many ways compares to OneUI 1.5 on S9+, but it seems like its lost some of the practical features over the years.
Thank you for reading my long rant, and any advice on the matter is appreciated."	N
Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra Scratches and Micro Scratches and Display Changes - Your Experience!	"Hey You All!  
I was wondering if your Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra started accumulating any scratches as soon as you started using it.  
Always used a screen protector, but I never managed to never have any scratches appear.  
Is it possible for scratches to go through the protector and onto the glass?  
Do some of you have experience with having the display changed on the phone and if so, was it a huge bummer?  
How much did you pay for it or did you do it yourself?  
Any of you had the Phone already having micro scratches out the box?  
Also what about the S Pen, it seems possible to scratch your phone using it."	N

Looking to buy an S22 soon. When should I buy?	"Hello!
I'm looking to upgrade from my note 8 to an S22 soon. With the foldable launch upon us in a couple of days, when should I buy my device? I'm not sure as to how the launch would affect the prices of this device.
Currently, we're seeing a discount of around 10-20% across the S22 range. I initially held off on buying this device on launch wishing there would be a magical unicorn in the form of a slideble phone from Sammy. But it looks like it is not going to happen this year.
I'm coming from a note 8 and previous to that, the S8. I just miss the times when you can use your phone one handed.

Camera Feature Request: Full Range of ISO & Shutter Speed when Setting Manually & Faster Shutter Spe	<span;>Issue & Request 1: 3 of the four rear-facing cameras are capable of capturing images with an ISO value below 50 (ultrawide=50; wide=12; telephoto & super-telephoto both=40). These values are achievable when ISO is set to "auto" only. However, when using "Pro" shooting mode (or when using Samsung's "Camera Raw" App) and manually adjusting ISO, the selectable ISO value is limited to a minimum of 50 for all cameras. The same is true of the minimum (fastest) available shutter speeds when setting manually, which can be set to a minimum time-value of 1/12,000th of a second. When using the camera in auto mode, faster shutter speeds are possible. While there exists a sort of "workaround" to achieve a desired ISO value for a given shutter speed, by keeping ISO set to auto and changing the "EV" value, this should not be required to achieve the lowest ISO value when shooting using manual settings. In addition, the minimum/fastest shutter speed should be selectable from manual mode, not only achievable when the camera's parameters are set automatically. So my request is that the full range of the cameras ISO and Shutter Speed values be able to be set manually from Pro shooting mode.<span;>Additionally, I noticed that even with fully auto shooting, the fastest shutter speed achievable with my new S22 Ultra, is far slower than with my old S20 Ultra 5G. While shooting very bright objects with my S20 Ultra 5G (such as a light bulb, or the sun), I was able to achieve incredible images with shutter speeds (as revealed by looking at the image details, after shooting), with shutter speeds faster than 1/120,000ths (one one-hundred-twenty-thousandth of a second). This was only achievable when the camera was in standard "Photo" shooting mode, and all settings were auto. However, even though the Image sensor, SoC and IPU are all improved over the S20 Ultra 5G in the S22 Ultra, I can't seem to shoot images with a shutter speed that is much shorter (faster) than one twelve-thousandth of a second‚Äî that is OVER 100X slower than my S20 Ultra 5G was capable of. That is an extremely significant downgrade. While I understand that image processing is limited by the IPU and SoC, all should be capable of achieving the same shutter speeds as was possible in my old S20 Ultra 5G, so this is clearly a software limitation. Therefore, please enable the full capabilities of the camera, as to allow the ultra-fast (virtual) shutter speeds I could achieve with my old Samsung device.<span;>In summary:<span;>1. Enable full manual control of complete ISO range, as defined by sensor.<span;>2. Enable full shutter speed range in manual control.<span;>3. Enable full potential of hardware capability by allowing shutter speeds in the sub-hundreth of a second range, which was achievable on the S20 Ultra 5G.<span;>*Of additional concern is that photos taken in 108MP mode, even when using full digital zoom, are still saved in 12000x9000 resolution. Obviously this means the image is upconverted, as the image sensor only has 108 megapixels on it, so by definition, digital zoom would result in images with lower resolution. The same goes for the other lenses, when in normal mode, that save 12mp images even when full digital zoom is used (4000x3000 pixels). Obviously this means they are upcomverted. Save the image in the amount of pixels captured, do not unnecessarily upconvert to 12MP when obviously the data is not there. That is not pixel binning, it is a blantant lie.	N

Just a heads up...	For those wanting to use the beta, know that certain features you may be using currently cannot in beta. I get many people want the candy, but the experience is limited and pretty buggy for some.You cannot use Good Lock app, especially Theme Park and any creations you've made using any of them will be set to default icons and colors in the beta. You cannot remake them.Overall for me, I really don't see much difference for general looks. They expanded the pallette colors to 16, but that's it.	N
Android 13 beta	Just a quick question since I can't find anything definitive. I have an s22 ultra locked to Verizon. Does that mean I won't be eligible for the beta firmware? I've never tried this before so I'm unsure how all this works.	N

S22 ULTRA BLUETOOTH DROPOUT	Do any have any idea what program or system process manages blue tooth connectivity? I want to add it to never sleeping, don't power manage, and ep alive because it turns off if it's not currently transferring data; this is a problem using Microsoft Dynamic Lock on the OS. So you know, if you get up and walk away from your computer, it locks; when you return, it can unlock or require a login.However, now, it just says either error dynamic lock is not working, or a few min after my phone screen sleeps, blue tooth sleeps, and I get logged out of my computer. It's not the greatest, I know it power saving because of how hot the phone runs compared to the note 20, it desperately needs a stronger battery, so in order to save power, they micromanage every process so any idle process is put to sleep.This not only affects dynamic lock, it also stops recording biometrics during sleep recordings...not cool samsung, audio will also cut out until it remembers it's playing something with an app exempt from power management.I'm using 60hz fhd+ and 24% brighness, eye guard / anti blue, and the sides and keyboard are getting warm to the touch. From Typing this....Ideas?Thanks.	N

Information regarding One UI Beta 5	Original screenshot by theblackcobraThis post is, an attempt, to help those that are constantly asking about the Beta. As of right now, the One UI 5 Beta is FULL. According to information from sammobile and I believe sammyfans, there was only 500 openings per region. Also, according to others of the Samsung Members community, it was only for UNLOCKED devices and various statements of "only on select carriers".There are rumors that the S21 will get the Beta. However, those are just rumors as of my current knowledge. Also, according an article from sammyfans, T-Mobile is testing a new software, for the s21, that MIGHT be some form of a Beta of One UI 5. However, according to the same article, it could also be some form of 4.1. In other words there is, so far, no concrete verification that it is indeed a type of One UI 5 Beta.For those with an unlocked S22 Series device, that has not gotten into the Beta, there is always a possibility that Samsung could increase the numbers, or even expand the range of devices on specific carriers. Unfortunately, as of now, we don't know if that will happen. The only thing I can suggest is to keep trying. People are constantly withdrawing, and thus, openings become available. I had the same problem with Beta for One UI 4, and I eventually got in. So take a deep breath, be patient, and don't give up.Even if some people aren't able to get in the Beta, the public release is always there. Well, when it's eventually actually released. One way or another, you'll be able to get One UI 5, even if it isn't the Beta. To those that will keep trying, I wish you all luck in getting in. I will, of course, be more than glad make other posts as new information comes to light on the Beta. Whether it ends up being released for other devices aside from the S22 lineup, more openings, etc. After all, we're all apart of the same community.Also, I apologize for the length of this post. I had a lot of info to convey. Anyways, ya'll have a good day, and good luck!üòÄEdit: Found this article online.https://www.dealntech.com/galaxy-s21-ultra-one-ui-5-android-13/It is expected, by the end of August, they will release the Beta to the S21 Series lineup	N

How does one move files from DCIM to the Images folder?	On my S22, I am unable to move JPG files from the DCIM folder to the Images folder.

Both the user guide and global manual offer no help.Now I can move files about on the S22 by connecting the device to a PC and use Windows' File Manager, but surely it's possible to manage files on the S22.If anyone has figured out how to move files on the S22, please share the secret.Solved!Go to Solution.

Samsung Notes Vector Annotations	"Is there any way to export a PDF from Samsung notes with the handwritten annotations saved in vector format?

Battery Health Data Collection for S22/+/Ultra	"I decided to start a simple spreadsheet for myself to track my battery cycles and health on my standard S22.  I am curious as to the longevity of this device matching up to the 5 years of support offered.  If others are willing to continue this journey with me for more data, I am willing to create a recording system through Google Suite and have an archive of this.
I was just going to record my battery cycles and ASOC (Absolute State of Charge) from the dumpstate log a few times a year.  Other ideas on useful information or more accurate methods to be included is welcome. However, I would like to keep things as simple to record as possible, so that data is as accurate between submissions as possible.
&amp;#x200B;
|Date|In Service Date|Cycles|ASOC|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2022.08.08|2022.03.03|145|99%|
&amp;#x200B;
The tiny battery has had me worried about battery cycles, which most articles I've read state the 300-500 cycle number to 80% capacity and I'm already at 145 cycle within 160 days. However, after reading this: [https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-808-how-to-prolong-lithium-based-batteries](https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-808-how-to-prolong-lithium-based-batteries) I am less than certain, because the battery model is rated at a nominal 3.88V, which in theory should place it in the 2000 cycle range even without Protect Battery mode. I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to chemical battery science, and this is a new exploration for me, so please feel free to share more resources.
Going back to older smartphones (2015ish) lithium-ion battery packs were rated in the 3.5-3.88V range as well, and I don't remember any of my battery packs making it more than a couple years before resulting in a severely diminished capacity.  So maybe the degradation concern has more to do with heat and extended periods of time at a high state of charge; the 85% protects against this, but doesn't do much to limit cycles because more frequent recharging is required within a smaller capacity band.
I have mostly been using Protect Battery mode at 85%, and trying to charge before 15%, except on outings where I wouldn't have the ability to charge in which case I charge to 100%.  It would be nice if others would be willing to contribute their data with anecdotal behaviors such as this to get a better idea of if Protect Battery mode is worth it or not over time.

Upgraded to 22 Ultra - Tests	"I decided to upgrade (through ATT) my Z Fold 2 to the Ultra. I missed having the Note 9 when I did and the S Pen uses and I fell in love with the green color they offer. I ordered it and I received it yesterday. I have 30 days to decide if I want to keep it or not.
I've researched the issues that have been prominent with the phone and have decided to do a few tests for myself and post some results that I've found. When I read through others issues with the Ultra, it intrigued me how the reviews were nearly split 50/50 - issues/no issues.
Device: 512gb RAM 12gb. Purchase date: 08AUG22
Here's some of my findings so far:
1. When I got the device, I did not set anything up or participate in smart switch. I made sure the device connected to WiFi and it did. It has remained connected for 16 hours so far as of writing. It has been connected to two different addresses.
2. I went straight to device information to check the software. It's running the most recent update of UI4. 
3. Always on display (AoD) was not in the pull down quick access settings like it is on the Fold, however I found it easily in settings and turned it off. From the start, AoD always sucked battery life more.
4. I tested to see how much juice it pulled when playing YouTube in comparison to the Fold2. I ran YouTube 30 mins on both devices and monitored the discharge. I also had the Fold opened up. 
The Ultra was at 39% and dropped to 37%. The Fold  40% and dropped to 37%.
5. I haven't charged the device yet. When I first turned it on it was at 43%. I played YouTube then left it in sleep for the night. Eight hours later the Ultra only dropped 1% of charge.
6. I have not removed the factory films yet (waiting for case and protectors). In the morning I played with the S pen a little bit. I like to doodle and the larger screen I fancy. I played with it for 15 mins. I did not have issues with the pen. I varied pressures and distance the phone connected to the pen. 
I have a Huion drawing tablet for digital art. The only thing the S pen didn't do was vary in thickness with pressure. The tablet is designed for that. I expect the S pen to not be. However, I wanted to state that point.
I failed to monitor battery discharge though it was still in the 30s.
7. I left the phone in sleep at home and will return to see if it lasted throughout the workday. Hopefully I can update this post with the results I find.
Any suggestions or reccomendations are welcome! I'm wary to use smart switch just yet but, I may give it a shot tomorrow to see if there's any effect. Currently the only thing I've done is log into my Samsung account.
I hope things stay on the positive end. So far I like the phone but it needs to run the way my Fold does or else it's going back. 
I'm planning on testing:
- Multpile Bluetooth connections.
- Cellular reception.
- More WiFi connections.
- Smart switch.
- Sound output (calls).
- Sound output (speakers)."	N

Gaming Controller S22U	"Hello!  
One thing about me getting the S22U was so I could get a controller to pop my S22U into.  
I've seen like the Razer Kishi, but its seems like really snug fit and would most likely scratch my phone.  
There has been some folks that I've seen getting it to work.  
But I found ""Nacon MG-X Pro Controller"" - Like an Xbox Controll with Bluetooth. Looks very promising and also the Xbox controllers has nice grip!  
There is one more that I found and find interesting.  
"" GameSir X3"" - Paired with USB-C &amp; even got cooling on the back!  
But it also seems abit small for my hands. I dont really know. Might be nice to have something abit compact if I have to store it in my bag for a trip.  
I watched a few videos on YT about these controllers with S22U, but not much talk. Just showing gameplay and what not.  
Maybe someone of you guys has one or both of these controllers, maybe something else that fits and works. I wanna know what you guys think! Tell me about your experience with YOUR controller!  
Tell me about the positivities and negativities of it and all you can think of and wanna share!

discord always shows at the top of the notifications :(	Is there a way to set notifications on the s22 ultra in a way that say for example, I have Gmail always the first to show at the top of the notifications?

Which phone better for this use, S22U or iPM13?	"Hey everyone! I hope it's ok to ask this here, I'm not really used to write posts on Reddit :)
I will buy a phone very soon, and am considering the iPhone 13 Pro Max or the S22 Ultra. I've done some research already but I write here hoping to have some additional feedback from fellow reddit specialists. My main use for the phone is the daily stuff (messages etc), photos/videos and gaming (I like being able to play the latest stuff on high quality). 
Which one would you recommend for this usage? I'm in Europe so if I understood correctly I would get the Exynos version for the S22 Ultra, maybe it's an important detail :)

Also, like has been suggested a few times, if you're having issues since installing Beta 5, it's best to take them to the Beta section of Samsung Members. You'll find a ton of help from others, and Samsung. It only took a day for me to get my issue solved."	N

Base S22 Snapdragon Battery Review/Optimizations	"Saw a lot of folks asking about getting better battery life on the base S22 SD variant. I consistently get 6 to 7 hours of screen on time with 24+ hours standby on most days. This can increase to 8+ hours if I exclusively use 60Hz instead of adaptive refresh rate. I'm on the August security patch.
Battery screenshots: [https://imgur.com/a/O0Hz8x8](https://imgur.com/a/O0Hz8x8)
Here are my settings:
1. **Enable suspend execution for cached apps in developer options:** This was probably the biggest battery saver for me. Go to developer options, search for ""suspend execution for cached apps"" and set it to Enabled. The caveat here is that it \*may\* cause delayed notifications from some apps. I, for one, haven't had that issue in the \~3 months of owning the device.
2. **Disable 5G:** My country does not have 5G yet, so it doesn't make sense to keep it turned on.
3. **Adaptive battery:** I've left it turned on; didn't notice any difference while keeping it off, YMMV.
4. **WiFi &amp; mobile data:** Always on, except while sleeping at night.
5. **Dark mode:** Always on.
6. **Always on display:** Turned off, since I never used it.
7. **Deep sleeping apps:** Anything that I don't need notifications from actively is present here. Currently have 40+ apps deep sleeping.
8. **Power saving mode:** Kicks in automatically through Bixby Routines when battery falls below 20%.
9. **Nearby device scanning:** Turned off in settings.
10. **Location:** Usually turned off unless I'm using navigation.
11. **Adaptive refresh rate:** Always on, except when power saving mode kicks in.
12. **Media apps which don't support adaptive refresh rate:** For apps that don't support adaptive refresh rate (Hotstar in India doesn't), I have a Bixby Routine that turns on 60Hz while using these apps. Otherwise, the display keeps fluctuating b/w 120Hz and 60Hz frequently, using more battery. YouTube and Netflix don't need to be included in this routine.
13. **Brightness:** Usually 30%-35% is more than enough when indoors; may bump up to 70-80% when outdoors. After 11pm, Bixby Routines moves it to 1% and turns on Extra Dim function.
14. **Enable slow charging at night:** Doesn't impact battery backup, but will help in having a better battery life in the long run. When I'm charging at night while sleeping, I have a Bixby Routine that turns off fast/superfast charging. It also turns on protect battery to 85% until 6am, and charges from 85% to 100% by the time I wake up.
15. **Clear cache partition from recovery and repair apps after every update:** It's just something I do, and I can't comment on whether this helps with the battery or not, but a lot of forums recommend doing this after every software update.
16. **Spotify:** Not really an optimization setting, but a caveat. For some reason, streaming music on Spotify uses a lot more battery than any other app, even if I have the library downloaded to the phone. Having said that, I do not have another streaming service's subscription, so I'm stuck with Spotify. Streaming songs for 4 to 5 hours in the background can cause a dip of an hour's SOT for me.
Now you might be thinking, if I'm paying $800 for a phone, it better work out of the box without you having to go through so much pain. And I totally get that and respect that. But trust me, enabling these settings will take at best 20 minutes, and in return you'll get a phone which is super compact, super sturdy, has one of the most brilliant screens out there, top-tier processor and is surely going to last you 3 years easily.
Having said that, I believe Samsung is gradually working on improving the battery optimizations with each update. I'm certain my SOT didn't cross even 4hrs in the first month. Even the S21 series now runs so much better after a year's worth of updates.
Most of these settings will work for S22+ and S22U as well, but since I don't own them, I can't comment on their results. If anyone wants to give it a shot, please post your experiences below.
I'll add more settings later if I missed any."	N
OneUI 5 Beta Fixed Stuttering	"Got my S22U from Google Fi not long ago after being on iPhone for 10 months and hating it, and the performance was *incredibly* disappointing. Especially the camera app - it's like we had gone back in time to 2014. All my previous phones, from the Note 20 Ultra and back for half a decade didn't have the problems this one did with stuttering/UI lag/frame skips in video. I tried all the usual tricks (lowering the virtual RAM, factory resetting and wiping the partition, etc etc) which helped but didn't fix it.
Sideloaded the Android 13 beta (it was not offered for Google Fi for whatever reason...) and it has fixed all of my issues so far, and my banking apps/Google Wallet/RCS still work. I'm now able to have Nova Launcher installed and everything is running like butter. The only slight stutter I had was when trying out Single Take (which for some reason has a lot fewer types of pictures it'll take now?).
Fingers crossed the beta proceeds smoothly and the final software has the same effect."	N

I can't decide whether to get the S22 or S22 Plus üò©	As per title, i can't decide to go with which. I currently have S10 Plus and the size is fine but i do struggle using it with one hand at times, especially when typing and trying to reach the across of the screen. I held the S22 at the store and i loved it but on the hand, the S22 Plus didn't seem that much bigger either. I am kinda sick of big phones at the moment but i'm worried if it's just a temporary thing. To put into account, i have bad eyesight and i don't always wear glasses. The sides of the S22s are also square-edged, so the phone would logically feel bigger than my S10 Plus, which has rounded edges and a curved screen. I've watched so many videos on both models but just can't seem to make up my mind. I am leaning more towards the smaller S22 but afraid to take the plunge. Can anyone convince me? üòÑ	N
Downgraded from the Note10+	"Just in case anyone else was considering moving from the N10+ to the S22U. I'm 2 weeks in and it's basically the same phone with a better camera. The battery life is worse, it gets hotter, it has connectivity issues, it lags doing basic tasks like voice searching, and I've already got a nice deep scratch down the screen that didn't have a stock protector like the N10+.
The camera is really nice though, the S Pen is way faster, and the fingerprint reader seems quicker and more accurate.
Overall I would take my Note10+ back in a heartbeat."	N

Same trade value for ZF2, ZF3, and S22?	I wasn't keen on upgrading from ZF3 to ZF4, but I figured I'd look what my phone is worth. $1000 USD for ZF2 and $925 USD for ZF1. They are even doing 1k for S22 which is normally lower when outside the "Z" line. Also disappointed that storage is not considered (I had the 1TB upgrade offer last year). Big win for ZF1 and ZF2 people wanting to upgrade, but I will certainly pass this year. Hope they have similar trade in offers for ZF3 for ZF5.	N

Thoughts on upcoming Fold 4 release and S22 ultra 6 month review	"I'll be trading in my s22 ultra for the upcoming Fold 4 release unpacked event and wanted to give a review of the last 6 months. 
I traded in my fold 3 for the s22 ultra.  Love the s22 ultra and if not for being a tech fanatic, it would be the phone to keep over the fold.
Hoping the fold 4 fixes the software issues the fold 3 had in terms of third party app compatibility.
I doubt they'll have it all ironed but it's gotta be better than what the fold 3 had going on.
I had the galaxy watch 4 for a few days but returned it after seeing how unready the software was out of the box.
Hoping the watch 5 pro is a good upgrade. Battery life already sounds amazing. 
Glad to see the buds pro 2 coming out, it's almost been two years since they were upgraded.
Looking for forward to tomorrow"	N
Anyone else disappointed in the S22	"I got the Galaxy S22 back in June and I don't get why it has so many good reviews. Even after fully updating the phone, it still lags a lot when scrolling through twitter or anything and switching apps, fails to play webms files a lot and lags the most when using the camera and taking pictures. The battery life is ass too. 
Honestly it feels like a downgrade from my OnePlus 8. In all this phone sucks and I have buyer's remorse. I've tried switching the motion smoothness to standard and disable 5G but that doesn't help much."	N
Gets hot outside in Texas	"Whenever I go for a walk or biking during day time, I generally wear a smartwatch and drop the phone in the backpack. Oh man, does it hot!!!

Wallet case	I'm thinking of ditching the actual wallet and only carry around my phone but I can't seem to find a good enough wallet case because of what i want.

Upgrade Note 9 to S22 Ultra?	"I'm thinking of upgrading simply because Verizon will give me $800 trade in for my Note 9. I don't NEED to upgrade, as my Note 9 is still running smooth for the most part. My only fear is that if I wait until my Note 9 is in need of an upgrade, it will be so old that I will not get much for trade in and have to pay more out of pocket towards a new one. If I knew for certain that I could get a similar trade in price in a year or 2, I would hold out, but that would likely not be the case. So price out of pocket is probably my biggest concern. 
What would I be gaining/losing if I upgrade? Is the S22 Ultra as good of a phone or better? The Note 9 is the best phone I've ever had. Not necessarily in terms of what it offered on day 1, but what it offers 4 years later. I've never had a smartphone that has lasted this long without becoming very laggy and battery life severely dropping. It FEELS like it runs just as smoothly and lasts just as long as it did 4 years ago. If I get an S22 Ultra, I would hope to keep it for as long. I know that longevity has yet to be seen on the S22 Ultra, but is there any reason why it wouldn't age as well as the Note 9 has?"	N

FHD 60 is NOT recording in 60fps?	I used to own a Note 20 Ultra before upgrading to the S22 Ultra. Any time I recorded video it was always either 1080p 60fps or 4K 60fps. But now with the S22U the framerate is all over the place. I recorded a video yesterday on the FHD 60 setting and just now looking at the file info via MediaInfo it is showing a weird framerate of 47fps, I've also had a problem with recording in 4k60fps where it doesn't actually record in 60fps. How can i fix this and why the hell does it say FHD 60 if it isn't infact 60fps. And yes i know about variable and constant framerate and at no time does the video I recorded yesterday ever hit 60fps. This genuinely pisses me off. I have a YouTube channel I need the best quality video I can get and 47fps definitely isn't it.	N

I know the new foldable galaxies have the new M12 OLEDs but why did they decide to not include this in the S22 Ultra for costs reasons and then let their competitor have it in their new phones. Seems like a big mistake to me. I know they are making a lot of money off apple for it but I buy new galaxies because they are always a step a head of iPhones. This might just make me switch to iPhones if they are coming out with Samsung's innovative technology before Samsung even does."	N

Try this if you game in your phone	If you Game on your phone try this idea your game will feel more smoother like you are playing on 120fps.

My question is, if I enable battery protect and limit the charge to 85% but, charge my phone more than twice a day (I tried and I charged like 4 times, but I used it more than normal). Would that still help my battery life in the long run? or will it still be the same as I will be charging the phone more?

I want to buy a new phone for my dad who is on a S9+ and my options are the 21fe and 22, I‚Äôm leaning more to 22 as he as always loved my iphones material being premium and thats what the s22 is similar too plus he takes alot of pics and it has a better camera also, all in all it should be big upgrade for him
My question is mainly about battery I heard its bad is that true? He doesnt really complain about his s9+ even after so many years so i guess 22 should be ok? No gaming no editing just social media calls maps when outside and emails thats about it
Any help and advice appreciated, the phones we get here are only exynos, price difference is about 150$ between 21fe and 22. Both are 256gb with 8gb ram.
(S22+ wasnt launched here that would be the best I know but its not an option)"	N
S22 ultra to Fold 4, worth the upgrade?	I am using a s22 ultra, I have hard all good things about foldables. Do you think it is worth to upgrade from s22 ultra to Fold 4?	N
Upgrade Note 9 to S22 Ultra?	"I'm thinking of upgrading simply because Verizon will give me $800 trade in for my Note 9. I don't NEED to upgrade, as my Note 9 is still running smooth for the most part. My only fear is that if I wait until my Note 9 is in need of an upgrade, it will be so old that I will not get much for trade in and have to pay more out of pocket towards a new one. If I knew for certain that I could get a similar trade in price in a year or 2, I would hold out, but that would likely not be the case. So price out of pocket is probably my biggest concern. 
What would I be gaining/losing if I upgrade? Is the S22 Ultra as good of a phone or better? The Note 9 is the best phone I've ever had. Not necessarily in terms of what it offered on day 1, but what it offers 4 years later. I've never had a smartphone that has lasted this long without becoming very laggy and battery life severely dropping. It FEELS like it runs just as smoothly and lasts just as long as it did 4 years ago. If I get an S22 Ultra, I would hope to keep it for as long. I know that longevity has yet to be seen on the S22 Ultra, but is there any reason why it wouldn't age as well as the Note 9 has?"	N

Phone got extremely hot!!	Hey all, yesterday while watching a video my S22 ultra(EXYNOS) got so hot, it was not possible to hold(the left side),I let the phone to cool down, it did and in about 5 minutes of just looking at instagram, it gets back to the 49 degrees ,and of course starts throttling, so basically if the screen is off the phone is fine, the moment I unlock it it starts heating to the point it is painful to hold, tried safe mode clearing the cache and even factory reset, but nothing helps. It does not heat up during charging. Also the battery is super bad since then. Do any of you have the same problem and how did you fix it?	N

upgrade time	I waited for the Fold 4 to come out only to be very disappointed. I'm trying to decide what to do now. The s22 ultra is probably my number one choice, with the One plus 10 pro or waiting even longer for the s23 ultra to launch. Or maybe another option on the android platform?

Possibly getting the S22 Ultra	"So I might switch to Google Fi, and they have a really nice deal on the S22 Ultra, they also have a deal on the Pixel 6 Pro. I'm leaning towards one of them but if I was to choose the Samsung, what are some cool features I'd get, also what would I miss from the pixel 6 pro?
Are there any bugs with the phone?
One other important thing to me is Snapchat and tik Tok, I know google partnered with snap and they have this cool feature where you tap the back of the pixel 6 and it throws you to the snap camera only. Is the quality good on the Samsung? Are there any cool features for social media on the phone?

samsung 20,000 mAh Battery Pack charging faster than it should.	"I have a battery pack that I got off ebay canada about a month or so ago,  it's an official battery pack (model eb-p5300xjegus), listed on the Samsung USA site:
samsung.com/us/mobile/mobile-accessories/phones/20a-battery-pack-dark-gray-eb-p5300xjegus/#specs
I got it to quickly charge my s22 ultra which I have set to only charge to 85% and this battery pack can charge it 2.5 times.
When I first got the pack it took 3 or so days to charge from empty, using the charger (model ep-ta200) from my old s20fe 5g, now as of today when I fully drained it while charging my s22 ultra (it got to 53%), I plugged it in to charge up, and it's going much faster using the same charger, already on the 3rd flashing led after not even an hour.  
I hope it's not damaged.

The snapdragon 8 is literally defective should be recalled	"Seriously this chip is not efficient at all and was a mistake and imo defective months later Qualcomm re released  snapdragon 8+ gen 1
Only difference is they changed fabrication to from Samsung to TSMC. Went from super high power draw to much lower draw with even better performance.
Samsung throwing in small battery and no cooling at all on base model is joke. Also read up about all throttling they doing on these phones. they know they ducked up and we payed price.

Folks with the Buds Pro and S22 Ultra	"Hi, I just noticed this today.
I'm playing music on my S22 Ultra and listening on the Buds pro.

Sometimes the variations are the volume or the sound comes across as a little odd. Oh and I am using Youtube music.

Are there any tips on how to make my S22U experience as pleasant as possible? I've heard about not using SmartSwitch and factory resetting right away for better performance/battery optimization or something, but I'm not sure how big that difference would be."	N
S9+ Upgrade to S21 FE/S22	"Hey there, recently my mic on my S9+ started failing and my battery depletes fairly quickly. While I love my S9+, I think I finally have to upgrade.
&amp;nbsp;
The S21 FE and S22 are only a $100 difference here in Canada, I don't really see much of a difference between the S21 FE and S22 aside from maybe the camera, size and all the negative reviews on Reddit about the S22 battery.
&amp;nbsp;
The S22 at my BestBuy comes with Snapdragon is what I've been told but I'm not sure if this chipset is exempt from all the reported issues. I'm leaning towards the S22 just because I'm liking the smaller size but I also don't want a sub par battery or to have to deal with any issues. I've also heard of freezes along with performance and overheating issues. Are these reported issues only with the Exynos chips or do they appear with the Snapdragon chips as well? I'd rather get the S21 FE if it's likely these issues will come up with the S22.

Thanks."	N
Bye Bye S22 Ultra	"Just preordered the Fold 4. The Ultra was easily the worst Galaxy phone I've had and I've had all of them since OG. Despite all the tips and tricks in these threads, my battery life has been terrible from jump. Can barely make it thru a day and I'm on WiFi most of the time. Signal strength, despite Samsung's claims to the contrary, is so bad it reminds me of the early days of cell phones in the 90s. Random reboots and the unusable screen in bright sunlight to top it off. Things have been so bad I even tried a 13 Pro Max for 30 days but couldn't handle iOS. 
Hoping the new generation of chip on the Fold 4 will restore my faith in Samsung."	N

Seeing the efficiency of the SD 8+ gen 1 is the driving reason for this decision as I've watched the z fold 4 and the z flip 4 both outlast the s22 ultra with much smaller battery capacities. 
So I'm curious does anyone else feel the same way?"	N

You may not know about these hidden features in the S22 Ultra......	"It's been two months now, and I gotta say, I am in love with my S22 Ultra. What I love most are those great features this phone packs. I collated all those hidden features, features that most don't talk about. Below are those features for your reference.¬†
If you prefer my video, here is the link:¬†[https://youtu.be/HSz0eTzkRhk](https://youtu.be/HSz0eTzkRhk)
What is your most loved S22 Ultra feature? 
&amp;#x200B;
1. S Pen: Write on the calendar
1. S22 Ultra comes with an S Pen. When you have a powerful accessory like the S Pen, why not use it for good? You can tap the Pen button and start writing on your calendar - so much easier for recurring events.
2. S Pen: Take notes like a Pro
1. Taking notes with your S Pen is easy. We all know that. That is not what I am going to tell you. Let's say you are watching a useful video and want to take notes about that video. You can bring up the Air Commands and tap on Quick Note to take notes. But this opens on top of the YouTube app. You can tap on the app bar to reveal Quick Options and adjust the Opacity of the notes app to see what‚Äôs behind, in this case, the video playing in the YouTube app. You can now write in the Notes app and watch the video. What‚Äôs great is that you can make the pen darker, so now you can write on your notes and watch the video. Very cool, right?
3. S Pen: Glance
1. Let's say you are using an app like Twitter and want to set aside this app so you can use another. You can use the S Pen Glance feature that reduces the app to a thumbnail - open the Air Command and tap on Glance. It will reduce the app to a thumbnail, and you can keep using your phone, open other apps, and whatnot. If you want to use the Twitter app quickly, you can hover your S Pen, and it will open the app in full-screen view. Yet another way to multitask. However, note that you can only have one app, use Glance. If you try another app while you already have an app using the Glance view, it will replace that app.
4. S-Pen: Blur things in screenshots
1. When we take a screenshot, we often want to blur certain content before sharing it. You can do this easily with the help of S Pen. Once you take a screenshot, choose the Blur pen brush, and now you can blur the portions of the content. Quite useful!
5. Video Wallpapers
1. Static wallpapers are good, but what is great are the video wallpapers. You can set a video as the lock screen wallpaper. Here is how you do it. Select a video or download a video from your favorite site like Pexels. Once downloaded, in your Gallery app, open the video and set the video as the wallpaper for your lock screen.
6. Samsung Internet: Change address bar position
1. S22 Ultra is a large phone, so it makes sense to position your address bar in Samsung Internet at the bottom for easy access. This makes it so much easier now to use the address bar one-handed. You can enter the Samsung Internet's Settings, choose Layout and menus, and select your desired address bar position.
7. Gallery app: Use styles
1. Gallery app has lots of goodies. You can use artistic styles to apply to photos and what‚Äôs great about this is that it can detect faces and pets, so you can choose whether to apply those effects to the background or the face. When editing a photo, tap on More options and then choose Styles.
8. Gallery app: Erase shadows and reflections
1. Sometimes you can‚Äôt avoid shadows in your photos, especially on sunny days. What if you have an easy way to remove those shadows? You can!¬†When editing a photo, tap on More options and choose Object eraser.
9. Gallery app: Create collages, reels, and GIFs
1. If you want to quickly create a collage of photos or a highlight reel from a set of photos, you can do that easily from your Gallery app. Select a few photos, tap on More and then tap on Create. It's that simple!"	N

I read somewhere that the magsafe popsocket doesn't work on the case I think, I'm not sure if the grip 2.0 does the same where it requires the magnet strength on the phone or if the grip 2.0 just uses an adhesive, if it does i think it would work fine but then how does wireless charging affect that sorry kinda rambly lol	N
What do you use your spen for?	"I find it impossible to live without an spen since it's instrumental to the running of my business 
1. I use my phone to let clients fill forms and sign + i create receipts and sign on them and send them to the client directly. Earlier id have to use paper... Which took a lot of time since I had to print and scan..  and obviously leads to waste too. 
2. Smart select is amazing since I'm not restricted to just rectangles and shapes anymore. Makes it a lot easier both when creating PDFs etc and sending my students/client info
3. It's so much easier to swipe type with the spen on large screens. Without the spen i need to basically use 2 hand typing which is a lot slower. 
4. The glance function is just fantastic. especially when filling forms/making receipts. In split screen the windows get far too small.. and moving back and forth to the recent apps screen just isn't very efficient. I've found some nice use cases for magnify too. Allows me to view an entire page/form without pinch zooming over and over again. 
5. Bt functionality is nice to have ie click through slides + control media and volume. I wouldn't really miss this though since I can use my watch for slides control and my phone is always close enough for media control 
6. Planning and scheduling and taking notes is slower with the spen since my handwriting sucks.. but for some reason it feels so much better doing the above with an spen rather than typing.
On a side note my handwriting sucks and i can't draw to save my life. The spen is helping me improve in both lol
In short: I'm basically hooked onto my spen and I'm not sure il ever be able to go back to a normal phone. What do you use your spen for? Maybe there'll be some use cases that pop up below that i can use too."	N
Spen is a pain to remove from slot	"Am I the only one who thinks that's the spen's push-button top makes it a real hassle to ""deploy""? 
The last pen I had was with the Note 4. The little cut-out in the body of the phone and exposing the end/side of the pen made it easy to just pull out in one smooth motion. A quick readjust of your grip towards the bottom of the pen and you're ready to go!
With the S22 ultra, you have to brace the phone body with one hand while you push on the bottom button (quite firmly) with the other. Then you have to brace the phone body from moving in the opposite direction while gain purchase on the slightly popped-out pen with your fingernails, pull it out a little more, and change your grip to hold the top of the pen's body. Then, finally, you can fully slide it out and readjust your grip again to final pen-holding position.
I've actually found myself using the spen less than I might have otherwise, purely due to this little ritual you have to perform every time you want to use it.
I've had the S22 for about 6 months now and it's really great in most every other way! Is the Spen mechanism something I'll get used to in time and after increases usage? Is there another Spen form factor offered by Samsung, or a third party, of which I'm unaware?"	N

I'm Really Enjoying my Experience	"Title says it all.
Had a Note8, switched to an iPhone 11PM (for girlfriend basically..) and then had to come back to Samsung after 2 years of reminding myself why I'm not a fan of Apple's ecosystem. I've had my S22U for about 2.5-3 months at this point
I have the 256GB 12GB Ram Snapdragon (AT&amp;T).
My experience has been great. From my reading on this sub I was slightly skeptical before purchasing, but I don't regret anything at all. Love having the spen back. I can use it to mark up things quickly for work, and love using it to take pictures after propping my phone up and getting where I want to.
Battery life definitely isn't exceptional, but it works fine for me. I use Protect Battery and I'm normally around 30-40% by the time I leave work including using GPS most days without car charging (don't have one in work truck yet). That's only with 2-3 hrs SOT before I drive home (charge on way home) but honestly I don't do mobile gaming so that's not a deal breaker for me. Also I've used super fast charging multiple times and love being able to get a solid chunk of charge in no time. I'm rarely somewhere I don't have access to a charger, and when I'm driving I charge/ use Android Auto so battery really hasn't ruined the phone at all for me.
I keep 120hz adaptive refresh rate on, WQHD+, but only use optimized processing speed. For me I haven't noticed not having enough speed for my day to day tasks, but do want to try out high and maximum speeds at some point to see if it makes a difference. I generally spend time on Instagram, Reddit, ESPN, Snapchat and web browsing through Chrome. No hiccups with speed with any of these apps. I also haven't taken advantage of DeX yet but it seems like a great feature for me, I just generally also have a Windows laptop with me.
Wifi calling and texting works great. I live where I barely have service so this feature is a must have and sound quality and texting works flawlessly over wifi for me.
I love my homescreen setup and haven't even downloaded any themes. I use natural screen mode over vivid because I was used to the ""truer"" colors from an iphone. Tried vivid for a little but wasn't my thing. The display is absolutely gorgeous. Whenever I look at other phones I am genuinely impressed how great mine looks. It's something I didn't think I'd notice that much (to be fair haven't messed with the iPhone 13PM yet though). I like the always on display to see where I'm at when charging, not necessary but a nice feature to not have to wake the phone to see.
I don't multitask often, but I love having the option if I want to. I don't find myself using the edge panels often so that's something on the list to try out more.
I'm just really happy with my experience with this phone. I do believe it's kind of a lottery and that is frustrating because I know some people aren't having good luck. I am a little dissapointed with Samsung for that.

Maintaining the high quality while posting on social media ?	What's the best and easiest way to hold quality of a video, while uploading it in the gram or reddit. The quality always drops, yet soon many users upload high quality videos, is there a app that dies a simple magic, or is it a grind of ending. However it is, I want to know.	N
I finally understand why i hated the s22 but loved the s22 ultra	"I couldn't stand the s22 display. Something about it just seemed low quality. After doing the research i think i have an answer. Its the pentile arrangement. A 1440p pentile panel only has 1440p green sub pixels but half the red and blue. You shouldn't count pixels but sub pixels instead.
A true RGB 1440p panel has 3088x1440p = 4.44 million RGB pixels, 
4.44mil red sub pixels  + 4.44mil green subpixels + 4.44mil blue subpixels = 13.3 million subpixels total
&amp;#x200B;
A true RGB 1080p panel has 2316x1080p = 2.5 million RGB pixels,
2.5mil red sub pixels  + 2.5mil green subpixels + 2.5mil blue subpixels = 7.5 million subpixels total
&amp;#x200B;
The S22 ULTRA has a 3088x1440p pentile display with:
2.22mil red sub pixels  + 4.44mil green subpixels + 2.22mil blue subpixels = 8.89 million subpixels total
&amp;#x200B;
The s22 series has a 2034x1080p pentile display with:
1.1mil red sub pixels  + 2.2mil green subpixels + 1.1mil blue subpixels = 4.39 million subpixels total 
&amp;#x200B;
So the ultra has 8.89million, well above the 7.5 million needed for 1080p. But the s22 has only 4.39million. Thats barely above true 720p. I think i finally have the proof to explain what my eyes were already telling me."	N

S21 faster than S22?	So I picked up my S22 ultra (Snapdragon) a few days ago. Moved everything over from my S21 Ultra (Snapdragon) to the new phone and I've been using it for like 5 days now. First thing I noticed is that battery life sucks compared to the old phone, but I guess it's just learning my usage patterns. However what I don't understand is why my S21 loads most light apps faster than the S22. Even when I close the app then quickly reopen it from RAM, the outcome doesn't change. The S21 also downloaded apps from the playstore faster. Anyone know a reason as to why my brand new phone is slugging behind the year and a half old phone? All settings that the phones have in common are matched.	N

How to disable 5G?	5G sucks with Verizon in my region. I want to disable it and only use 4G/LTE. I was able to do it on my S21 Ultra using Activity Launcher, but that's not working on the S22 Ultra. Does anyone know how to do this?	N
question about battery life on one UI 5 beta	Hey all! I have read opinions sprinkled across the sub about this topic but I want to ask directly, has anyone used the new beta and found a substantial increase in battery life? If so, could you please give me your experience before and after?	N
Frequent notifications from 'optimised' apps	"I have a few apps that I thought I optimized in terms of battery usage and notifications frequency, but I feel like I still get lots of notifies - like every 5-15 min. That's just too much and I think I don't need the phone to show me new stuff that often and drain the battery while checking for new content.
Lets look at my two examples: Reddit and LinkedIn - both apps set in battery 'restricted' mode and also both set to 'sleep'¬†in background usage limits menu. And I still get notifications every few minutes. When I tried putting LinkedIn to 'deep sleep' I stopped getting notifications at all, so I think I'm missing a middle ground in these options (it's not like I get exciting new job offers every 10minutes :) but I get some other notifications (articles, invites) that i'd like to see every 2-3h). So from what I can set up righ to now, it's either frequent notifications or no notifications at all. And I can't find any notification frequency options in system notification settings. 
Any advice how to customise/improve that?"	N
This is a different phone on One UI 5 beta, much better	"I switched about a month ago from a Pixel 6 Pro due to the poor modem in it, and I've been pretty unhappy with the S22 Ultra. It has been pretty laggy and glitchy compared to the Pixel 6 Pro which is riddled with bugs. 
Well I flashed the One UI 5 beta last night (T-Mobile, locked) and this is a different phone. The UI is **much** more responsive, fluid and I currently have no bugs with it.
If you're S22 Ultra is running good, then great. If not I recommend trying out the One UI 5 beta, and maybe debloating all the Samsung apps. I followed this [guide from XDA](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/oneui-5-beta-snapdragon-galaxy-s22-s22-s22-ultra-oneui-5-0-beta-thread.4476787/)

What percentage of internal storage needs to be empty to avoid slow downs?	"Does filling your storage causes slow downs? Should i leave 10% free or is it better to just leave a certain amount of gigabytes free.  
So for my 512gb device, the OS takes up 60gb out the box leaving me with 452gb.  
10% of 452gb is 45gb to leave free  
But that sounds like a lot of wasted storage. I am hoping i can get away with leaving 20gb free or something less than 45gb.

Base S22 handles games worse than the iPhone XS (2018). Is this an Exonys issue?	"Anyone else having problems with FPS games such as Apex, Call of duty mobile and PubG on the S22? Even though my phone rarely heats up, there's almost a constant stutter and the visuals look considerably worse than on the four year old iPhone XS. I have to disable a number of visual effects to make it run somewhat smoothly. How is this possible, with the S22 having twice as much ram and a 120hz display? 
Is this an Exonys issue? Or bad optimisation on Android? Or could it be Samsung's game booster app that's the culprit here?  I wouldn't say that the games are unplayable on the S22, but the performance is very poor for such a new phone. It even struggled to download in-game assets on Cod mobile, completely freezing from time to time."	N

Battery is pretty good too, i feel a slight improvement but mine was already good, but my S22 Ultra finally feels as good, if not even smoother now than my S21U finally.
This phone finally feels like what it should feel like now imo.
Shutter lag also seems really good now i really have no issues. 
Switched back to my S21 Ultra for about a week and the S22 Ultra feels like a breathe of fresh air. Display looks much better, feels smoother now, more capable camera and clearer speakers, easier to see in the sun, and suprisingly my S22 Ultra stays cooler in the heat than my S21 Ultra...."	N

I've read reviews and the ones for the plus are better, but looking through this sub it seems the base one seems to be better? Are they laggy? I would think about the ultra, but I really don't like it's look, and I hate the phones with the pens.

overheating while charging	"I know there are a lot of threads about the topic but i have nearly no internet connection here so maybe an own one will work better for me. I am on vacation with my family in france and we are camping. That means there is no A/C or something like that. Through the day it gets pretty hot (around 32¬∞ Celsius and barely wind). Normally I am able to charge my phone (S22 Exynos) trough the night and thats fine. But with a lot of free time there is a lot of batteryusage. And reloading it warms it up a lot. My battery gets around 45-50¬∞ C and sometimes even warmer. Altought it's not directly in the sun, I took it out of the case and it's not fast charging. So now my question is if there is any lifehack to get rid of this batterydamaging problem. Could you cool it through shutting it down or but it in a wet towel? Is the slow charging better? Do some of you have the same problem? 
I am new to reddit so sorry if there is any misunderstanding. :))"	N
Samsung Music gone?	"Setting up my new s22U, transferring from an s20+. Is the Samsung Music app no longer available? I can't find it in the Galaxy Store nor the Play Store on this device.  What's a good alternate that I can use as a secondary music player, that can read/import playlists?

help with s22 battery life decision	"I'm looking to buy a new phone and I'm between the S22 and pixel 6. I'm currently on a pixel 2 which lasted me nearly 5 years now and I've loved it. So far I'm leaning heavier towards the S22 but all of the reviews and comments about the battery are scaring me off. My current pixel 2 battery is absolutely terrible, lasting only a few hours of mild to moderate use.. So anything better than this will feel like an upgrade. But I want a phone with a battery that can last all day if I'm buying a new phone. I'm not a gamer fyi. 
Is the battery life truly that bad or am I only seeing posts and comments by people that are frustrated with their expectations of what a good battery should be?"	N

S22 giving haptic feedback when turned face down	I just got an s22 and I noticed that whenever I move a phone in a way that I'm going to face it down, it gives me a weak haptic feedback.

i only paid $800 for my S20+ two years ago...thinking it might be a good idea to upgrade right now, go from 128GB to 256GB, and basically have rented my current phone for $150 for two years. anyone have any thoughts on that upgrade path? is it worth it?"	N
Going from S22 -&gt; Flip 4 - Is the camera significantly worse?	"Hey all,
I am considering trading in my S22 and taking the bundle offer for the galaxy z flip 4, buds pro 2 and galaxy 5 watch and the only hesitation I have is that I don't want too big of a downgrade in camera quality. I have the standard S22 5g which boasts a 50mp camera but I know the sensors play a big role in camera quality overall so wanted some insights on how big (if at all) of a downgrade this is.

Almost but not exact: Z Fold4 vs S22/S22+ rear cameras	"After a little research and help from u/DiederikR for checking the Fold4 sensors, I found out that the Z Fold4 uses the same rear camera sensors as the S22/S22+, except for the ultrawide sensor. I've also added the sensors used on the Fold3 for added comparison and noticed all three share the same selfie cameras (cover screen camera for the Folds).
Here's a short summary of the camera sensors:
Z Fold4
main: 50MP Samsung S5KGN3
ultrawide: 12MP Sony IMX258 (technically 13MP)
3x telephoto: 10MP Samsung S5K3K1
cover screen: 10MP Sony IMX374
S22/S22+
main: 50MP Samsung S5KGN3
ultrawide: 12MP Sony IMX563
3x telephoto: 10MP Samsung S5K3K1
selfie: 10MP Sony IMX374
Z Fold3
main: 12MP Sony IMX555
ultrawide: 12MP Sony IMX258 (technically 13MP)
2x telephoto: 12MP Samsung S5K3M5 (technically 13MP)
cover screen: 10MP Sony IMX374
While some websites mention that the S22/S22+ use the 12MP S5KGN5 sensor for the main rear camera, u/ThisFlameIsFire who worked on S22/S22+ GCam noise configs can confirm that they use the S5KGN3 sensor."	N
Verizon extender and Aug Samsung S22 Patch	"Folks,
&amp;#x200B;
Since I applied the Aug patch for my S22 yesterday out of nowhere is a rogue Verizon extender taking over my phone at my house.  I don't even know why there is one this area has great coverage and 5G.  I know it is not supposed to block internet but it does.  I chatted w/ Verizon support for 3 hours yesterday and even gave them the extender ID but nothing seems to have changed and TBH I don't think they really care.
I think I was handed off at least 3-4 times because they kept asking the same stupid questions.  I almost lost it when they insisted on a network reset which did nothing of course except wipe out my routines, connections, and apps that use bluetooth.
I filed an FCC complaint.  Is there anything I can try or do because this is beyond frustrating now.  Yes I put wifi on, but in my backyard it is marginal and this beast takes over.
I will say the S22 has been a monthly nightmare w/ radio patches since I got this thing but the wife's iphone 12 is also seeing this.  The kids iphone 13 no problems."	N
How does the ATT trade-in promotion for the S22 work if you buy the phone through the Samsung website?	I placed an order for my new Galaxy s22 ultra through the Samsung website. I selected the $800 ATT trade in for my old S7, and Samsung seemed to recognize it on the initial order page. At checkout and in the receipt I was emailed however, it only listed the instant rebate of $150, and there was no mention of $800 credit. Will ATT now automatically send me prepaid packaging so I can send in my old phone, and then the credit will begin to be added, or did I do something wrong?	N
adding a line to get free s22 phone?	"I've been a TMO customer since 2017 on my mom's account. I have one voice line and my phone is paid off.
Did a change of responsibility 2 weeks ago and now have my own account and same number from 2017
They say the change of responsibility doesn't count and I have to add a new line for the free s22 ultra promo.
I'm confused because the acct is brand new and if I came from att to TMO, I'm guessing I'd qualify.
Can I add the new line to get the free phone.
I'd now have 2 lines. Primary line and secondary line
Can I port my primary line (the line before adding the second line for the promo) to Google voice or number barn
Then port it back over the newly created secondary line ?
I only want to have the one voice line but as someone who started a new TMO account 16 days ago I def want to be able to take advantage of the free phone promo
Can I port right back in?
Or do I have to wait 90 days?
Isn't the 90 days restriction only on port in promotions?
The line added for the free phone would still be on the account. I would just get rid of my first line but keep the same number and move it to my second and only line"	N

Samsung S21 Ultra/S22 Ultra, Tab S8 Ultra - Privacy &amp; Security vs Apple?	"I know this is a Samsung sub-reddit, so I'm going to likely get certain answers here favorable to Samsung, but I'm hoping for some objective input, if possible.
I like Samsung's S21/22 Ultra phones, s-pen, KNOX, One UI (pretty repsonsive &amp; not filled with bloatware like it once was), ability to lock down the Lock Screen and limit access to just what you want to allow (no camera, no phone access, etc., while locked).  
The only things I hope will improve over time are: (a) stop using the edge curved displays and go 100% flat, (b) improve on battery life (s22 Ultra took a step backwards and falls behind iPhone 13 Pro Max), (c) stop over smoothing and whitewashing faces on photos or allow users to switch that OFF.
That said, my main concern (and question here) is in regards to Samsung's trustworthiness in the areas of security and privacy.  I read somewhere that DoD approved mobile phone devices lists S21/S22 Ultra, and I didn't see Pixels nor iPhones on the list, surprisingly!  That seems to speak well for Samsung in these 2 areas.
However, I've come across postings online that have said Samsung's service terms and fine print for privacy is concerning, though I've not gone through the details to see for myself.
As for security, I've come across postings saying KNOX was defeated in the past, somehow.  And I'm wondering if Samsung phones are less secure than iPhones architecturally and based on ability to side load or download apps from other places like Samsung store or elsewhere.
Thanks in Advance!"	N
Do you use a screen protector on S22 (Ultra) phone?	"Got the Ultra a couple of days ago and I am contemplating whether I should use a screen protector for this phone. Heard a lot of people say this phone got micro scratches on the display very easily - but I dunno, if I use a plastic screen protector it will also scratch and probably scratch even faster than the phone display itself, if I used glass, I'll probably have to go UV and also heard a lot of horror story about it (like the screen coming off on its own, or the glue seeping in and brick the phone plus they are pretty expensive)  - and they will all be scratched sooner or later anyway
I find that with the curve and in-screen fingerprint scanner, getting a screen protector doesn't seem to be as straightforward as it used to be. So kinda want to hear your opinion and the reasoning for your decision. 
To screen protection or not screen protection, this is the question."	N

UPDATE on my new S22 Ultra	"Took a few side by side pics with the S8 and S22U and... ngl I'm disappointed. Reviews on youtube make it seem as if the quality has improved so much but the difference it's actually negligible. In fact, my S8 took more color accurate pics in some instances. The noise on the S22 still persists even with scene optimizer\*\* on, whereas edges and textures are a lot smoother and more pleasant to look at on the S8. 
Another issue I noticed: My phone shuts off at 3% battery instead of 0%. At first I thought it was a safety measure like windows PCs have, but it indicated 0% battery when I tried to turn it back on. It's happened twice now. I've already charged it from 0-100 once. I'll do it once more to see if it's a calibration issue.
\*\*Without scene optimizer turned on, images are just hard to look at. Very grainy, way too much noise. Very bad considering it's a 2022 flagship"	N
s22u+ or z flip4?	My galaxy s9+ is unfortunately dying. Ive had the phone for 4 years so its about time to upgrade. The newest options seem to be the s22 or the new flip phones coming out in 2 weeks. I like the flip 4 but i am nervous about battery life and the cracked screens ive seen others complain about. However these complaints are for the flip 3 as the flip 4 has not been available to the public yet and maybe these issues will be better with the new generation. My 9 might not make it another 2 weeks for the flip 4 however i have see many reviews of the s22 and people hating it. Im not sure which to get any suggestions?	N
Should I upgrade to the S22U now or wait for the S23U	"I got a s10, it is damaged, cracked screen, ghost touch, terrible battery lag and heat. Should I bite the bullet and hold on till the s23U or just get the S22U. I've had this phone since 2019. 
I do have other Samsung accesories which are farily new, watch 4 classic, (now lost buds pro) and tab s7+. Would a upgrade change how the acceosires work?
On a side note, buds pro 2 worth it since I lost my buds pro?"	N
I bought the S22 Ultra: Experience so far	"I've had it for a day now. Model SM-908E/DS. I'll be testing it thoroughly so I can spot issues early on and return it if necessary. My previous phone was the galaxy S8.
Issues I have noticed so far:
\-Shutter lag. Not in the sense that image capture is delayed (as some people have experienced), but in the sense that spamming the button doesn't work. It takes about a second to capture the next image. Get this: My 5 Year old S8 is 2x FASTER.
\-Images are noisy compared to my s8 which is a lot softer. Tbh... i prefer that. The colors on the ultra are a lot more accurate ofc but the graininess is annoying. And it gets worse in indoor lighting conditions. Now that mention it though.. before the S8 I had an S5. And i felt the exact same way about the S8, when compared to the S5. In a way, the S5 took sharper and cleaner images. It seems that improvements in image quality over the years are mostly an illusion. In some areas such as night mode, the differences are indeed day and night (pun intended). But overall, not much has changed. Some things have regressed imho.
\-Geekbench 5. I did a test when the phone was relatively cool, around 34 Celsius. (lowest temp reading was 33 btw, idk if that's good or bad. U guys let me know). I got a decent score. 1226 single vs 3447 multi. The processor was set on high performance. Then about an hour later when the battery was at 47% and the temperature was at 40 deg, I got 978 vs 3150. The processor was set to MAX performance. That's a massive drop. I expected it to be higher than the first test.
\-Idk if this is necessarily a bad thing but only 4.9 GB RAM out of 12GB is free. I haven't downloaded many apps, the storage is still empty. I haven't transferred any media or data from my old phone yet. It's relatively empty. I've cleared the memory with Device care. No apps are open in the background. Can u guys please let me know if if there's a problem with mine. I feel like 50% ram used is a bit too much.
\-The battery is decent so far. I get around 7.5 hours SoT with light to moderate use: YT, TikTok, downloading apps, configuring settings etc. Just the basic stuff you do with a brand new phone. I'm hoping it improves. The discharge rate is around 11.5% per hour. Brightness is at 55%, 120Hz, 1440P.However...accubattery states that the battery health is at 91% and the capacity is 4535 mAh. Does this mean accubattery has an issue or has the battery degraded?"	N
How do telephoto camera works on s22?	"I was testing out a displayed S22 ultra and got confused how zooming works.
When I go from x0.6 to 1x, the camera lense being used changes as expected. However, even when I raise the magnification past 3x, lense does not change despite that s22U has 3x telephoto lense. The change happens only at ~10x. Once again, the periscope lense is not being used until ~30x despite that the periscope lense has magnification of 10x. 
How do these lenses work?"	N
I finally understand why i hated the s22 but loved the s22 ultra	"I couldn't stand the s22 display. Something about it just seemed low quality. After doing the research i think i have an answer. Its the pentile arrangement. A 1440p pentile panel only has 1440p green sub pixels but half the red and blue. You shouldn't count pixels but sub pixels instead.
A true RGB 1440p panel has 3088x1440p = 4.44 million RGB pixels, 
4.44mil red sub pixels  + 4.44mil green subpixels + 4.44mil blue subpixels = 13.3 million subpixels total
A true RGB 1080p panel has 2316x1080p = 2.5 million RGB pixels,
2.5mil red sub pixels  + 2.5mil green subpixels + 2.5mil blue subpixels = 7.5 million subpixels total
The S22 ULTRA has a 3088x1440p pentile display with:
2.22mil red sub pixels  + 4.44mil green subpixels + 2.22mil blue subpixels = 8.89 million subpixels total
The s22 series has a 2034x1080p pentile display with:
1.1mil red sub pixels  + 2.2mil green subpixels + 1.1mil blue subpixels = 4.39 million subpixels total 
So the ultra has 8.89million, well above the 7.5 million needed for 1080p. But the s22 has only 4.39million. Thats barely above true 720p. I think i finally have the proof to explain what my eyes were already telling me."	N
s22plus soaked into a pool because I was testing the IP68 feature	"Then dried it for a few hours. Wiped it with a Kleenex including the charging ports. Then charged it. 
Note: ran out of juice for like 2 hrs already (air dried it for 2 hours too)
So after 2 hrs i connected it to the charger.. Then it showed that the charging port still has moisture. So i unplugged it (take note that the battery still has moisture and my phone keeps notifying me thru small vibrations that it has still moisturr) and then put it into a shoebox with 2 silica gel packets. The vibrations eventuall stopped. 
Do you think charging it while it still has moisture reduces my phone's life?"	N
s22 or zenfone 9 ?	"Hello, i now want to upgrade after 7 years of using the note 5, i want a compact phone thats blazing fast, doesnt get hot easily, bugless, nice cameras and quality build. of course any more features or gimmicks good to see.
the s22 shouts out quality, the cameras are excellent, the display is flagship level, seems ok.
on the other hand, i hear alot about performance and battery issues, so im curious a little.
the zenfone is completely the opposite, the performance and battery is where it shines, but cameras, display, quality build are not good for its price.
theyre about the same price and both avaliable here, help me decide, thanks.

S9+ to S21 FE or S22	" I am looking for a new phone to replace my S9+. Initially I wanted to get the S21 FE, but I'm afraid it won't be that much of an upgrade. My main priority is a good camera. I use my phone for browsing, social media... I'm not really a gamer. I also looked at the (base) S22, but I read a lot of bad stories about the battery. On average, I get about 5 hours of screen time per day.
The S22U is a bit too expensive (and big) for me personally.

s22 ultra to flip 4?	so im considering selling my s22 ultra for a flip 4, mainly because its a bit smaller and will actually fit my hand. what are you thoughts about it? if im able to sell it for 1,000 to a family member that has been looking for one, and just get the 256gb flip 4 for 999 im basically swapping them off. my main usage is doordashing and besides that i dont really do much besides the occasional clash of clans and watching videos. so the pen and such wasnt really that much use for me. i did see the battery life is like 3700 to the 5000 which i think will be the biggest downgrade as always having the flip open to doordash will for sure cause me to keep it charging unlike the s22 ultra which would typically last me through my whole route if uncharged. a family memeber is willing to give me the money for it tomorrow to put the down on it and once i get it on the 26th i would give said family memeber my ultra when the flip arrives.

Which is the best free app for shooting video on the S22 Ultra?

- The ""Camera"" app also keeps changing the Filter back to the default ""Original"" one.
- When I have my USB C microphone plugged in, sound on video playback immediately dies!

Best Charger for S22 Ultra?	"Dumb Q: which charger for my S22 Ultra?
First time samsung user. I got the s22 Ultra for work (and the Beats Pro) and I'm in love. Never switching back to any other brand.
That said, I've been using chargers from my old device and it's painfully slow and inconvenient. I'm not sure which charger to buy between the super fast wireless charger and the 45w PD power adapter. I'm using an Otterbox Commuter case which says it's compatible with wireless charging but ive never charged wirelessly and always assumed it was an inefficient gimmick.

I pulled the trigger! Got an S22U!	"I had a Samsung S8+ and loved it, but decided to give iPhone a try a bit ago. Overall I like the iPhone a lot, but I‚Äôm a tech heavy user and really missed not being able to drag/drop music and movies, not being able to mirror my screen to chromecast, and after seeing the 120Hz screen at Best Buy my iPhone 12 Pro looks so laggy now haha. 
With Samsungs fantastic trade ins I got the 512 GB phantom black for about $375 after all trade in credits. My iPhone also only has 128gb and I keep running out of storage and iOS makes it SO hard to move pictures and movies off the device, so I‚Äôm really excited to not get a low storage warning all the time and apple constantly bugging me to upgrade my iCloud storage. 
I‚Äôm selling my iPhone and trading in an S21U I picked up cheap locally, do you have any tips on what I should do so Samsung won‚Äôt reject the trade in? The phone works 100% but I don‚Äôt know how stingy Samsung is and having never done it I‚Äôm nervous. 
Thanks for all the posts! I‚Äôve been deciding and lurking for a couple months trying to decide, but with the trade in deals and all your reviews I‚Äôm really excited to try Samsung again!

has anybody used "link to windows" for windows 10?	"so i was trying to use the ""link to windows"" feature, and everything went smooth according to the instructions, until the phone scans the QR code, and then asks for the 0 digit code shown on pc. but the problem is, theres no code. nothing happens to the pop up window with the QR code, i have to manually click ""done"", and then it closes, and then im just stuck on ""please open your phone companion - link to windows and sign in with (\_\_insert my email here\_\_)"", and then a forever spinning circle thingy made up of dots. and underneath that, ""did you know you could sign in with QR code?"" and a button that says ""generate QR code"". 
from what i noticed, one of two things could be happening. 1. the windows app isnt signing in properly, it looks like its trying to sign in and its stuck for some reason? or 2. it needs the android app to scan the QR code properly in order to sign in, which i dont think its doing, cuz when i point my phone at my screen, it doesnt even get to the QR code, as soon as even 1/4 of the QR code shows up on my screen, mind you, not even in the scanning box, just on the side, the app would stop the same way as if it just scanned something, and then at the bottom, theres a brief pop up that says ""something went wrong. please ensure the same account is signed in on the pc"" 
has anybody else run into this issue? anybody know how to fix it? or just link it properly?"	N

Question/Advice - My S22 Ultra is set to adaptive and does not get bright outdoors?	"Strange behaviour - it does not boost the brightness, outdoors it does not go above 500 nits, im saying 500 nits because my Pixel 5a has 800nits and that is brighter outdoors.
When i restart the phone, it boosts the brightness for a minute or so and then goes dim again.
The brightness slider shows it full.

I've decided to pre order the fold 4. I have an s22 ultra now but am wondering if something different will be the right direction. I've got no experience with foldable phones and the idea intrigues me. For you fold owners out there, would say the trade is worth it? Just a little nervous, especially about the crease. 
I don't know if it's just me but my s22 ultra has been a major disappointment. It has been buggy since day 1 and feels so much slower than my note 20 ultra that I had before the s22.

How can I stop my (Samsung) Camera app from closing every 2 minutes?	"Hello 
How can I stop my (Samsung) Camera app from closing every c. 2 minutes? 
Background
I am trying to take videos using a tripod, and I have discovered the ""Video Pro"" mode, which gives a lot of extra features (including being able to see which microphone(s) are connected and changing it if required).

My S pen is behaving weirdly for some months now. It got unpaired with air actions and can't be paired again. The pen icon next to the alarm stays there permanently even after the pen is inserted. It's pretty non-functional. Could someone advise if this is because of the pen or the phone?		N
S22 Ultra regret.	"Had the phone now for about 4 months or so (UK model) and if I'm honest, my previous p30 pro was way better in many many ways, the only thing that the s22 ultra outperforms on is the camera and even then quick starting the camera at the moment takes more than 4 seconds, by then the moment I wanted to capture has passed.
I have to use the ultra constantly on power saving to get it through the day, when on my huawei I could get a solid 2 days from one charge not using power saving. It just really isn't good enough considering the overall cost of the device and also the battery size.
I honestly cannot get my head around the lag, and I know if I do x y and z in the settings it'll improve performance, but that's not the point. I shouldn't have to do anything to get the best out of the device - it should just work.
Dissapointed doesn't really cut it, it'll be the last Samsung device I'll ever use I think."	N

Galaxy S22 Ultra (U1 Model) and eSIM	"Today I finally got the eSIM in my Galaxy S22 Ultra (Factory Unlocked Model) activated and it was a struggle to get it done, so I thought I would share the process in case other need it.
Firstly I tried calling into customer service and at least in my case I kept getting very nice but ultimately ineffective reps who for one reason or another couldn't active my eSIM and I suspect I now know the reason.
I finally had a free moment and stopped into a corporate store and asked an employee there if they could activate my eSIM.
He said that he had not had luck with activating Samsung eSIMs but he would give it a try because he was slow and bored.
He got my IMEI2 and entered it into his system, removed my SIM, restarted my phone and nothing. I said that I think I am supposed to receive an email with a QR code, but obviously could not if I didn't have Internet. He logged onto the Wi-Fi at the VZW store and nada, no email, nothing.
He checked his system and it took my eSIM and it showed at active in his system, but not on my phone. Then we both started to try and find the QR and we came across a generic QR code on VZW website with instructions on how to activate a Samsung eSIM and that was the trick. 
I scanned the generic QR code (which looks like an example on VZWs website, but in actually is whatever is needed to activate the eSIM) with the SIM card manager and that was it.
It took a minute, but then the phone asked me to restart it and presto my eSIM was activated.
The website instructions are not written well and make it seem like a QR code needs to emailed to you for the process to work when im actuality all you need to do is have a VZW employee add your IMEI2 into their system and then scan the generic QR code.
To test the process the VZW employee took out of his pocket his own personal factory unlocked S22 Ultra did the same process and it worked.
He said I have been trying for a month to activate the eSIM with no luck, it shouldn't be that hard."	N

Just ordered S22 Ultra, open for all forms of recommendation	"I just ordered the S22 Ultra 256GB (Exynos).
Moving from Pixel 5, primarily due to poor battery life as well as crappy power use. P5 shits itself on some basic power usage, like video call and internet browsing at the same time, video will be choppy with frame drops etc.
While I am no gamer at all, I picked S22 Ultra over S22+ due to higher ram (which I guess is key for smooth video experience), and better battery. 
Before P5, I used Note 9. While Note 9 was built like a tank and the performance was amazing at the start, at 2 years mark it was pretty shit with lags and poor battery life.
Samsung in general has improved a lot since then in my experience, specially opting in for Google stuff  instead of Samsung's crappy ads based stuff as well as cleaning up One UI. I have been happy with Tab S8 which convinced me to give S22 Ultra a try.
Once I get the device, what's in your experience are the to-go steps/tweaks. My goals:
Extremely well:
1. Battery life
2. Typical browsing experience
3. Consistency, touch and feel
Well enough:
1. Still camera
2. Frame drop less video
Couldn't care less:
1. On device gaming"	N
Pathetic battery life on S22	"My Pixel 4a had awesome battery life. It would have about 50-60% of battery remaining at the end of the day (I use my phone 1.5 to 2 hours a day)
The S22, on the other hand, after 1 hour of usage, it's at 30%, and struggles to last for 24 hours on a full charge. Yes, I have tried enabling adaptive battery, limiting CPU power, not having many apps open, not having shit running in the background, all of that, and I use the phone as much as I did when I had the 4a. Can't believe this phone is literally almost 3 times the price, has a larger battery, and struggles to keep up.
Yes, I understand it has the 4nm processor, but I don't really care about that, as it is still a phone. What am I gonna do, program on it? There isn't much of an improvement in my perspective in terms of smoothness.
So technically the only upgrades I'm getting are the cameras and the better fingerprint reader, along with face id (I don't really care about that).
I sense this post will receive many downvotes.
Also, don't tell me to disable 120hz, this is an $800 phone, and I expect a smooth display."	N
Get the S21FE or spend 150$ more for S22?	"Currently I can get a S21FE (SD888 6/128GB) for 520$ and the S22 (exynos 8/256GB) for 670$, and I'm having a hard time deciding between the two.
I was always a mid-range phone guy, currently using the A71. I know I will be happy with either of the two, but if there's enough reason for it, I am willing to pay the extra for S22. 
I enjoy the screen size of both phones, so the smaller S22 isn't an issue for me. I would mainly be opting for the S22 due to the camera and build quality, but to be honest I'm still not convinced. 
I do lots of photography, and work part-time in the film industry, so a good phone is kinda necessary for me i.e. good screen to use as additional monitor wirelessly connected to the camera, and snappy performance, and I know both of them tick those boxes.
But my main concerns are mainly:
* is the S22 battery enough (I come from the A71, and after almost 2 years, I'm still happy with the battery life, honestly no issues). 
* Is it worth getting the Exynos version of S22 (there's no SD version in my country) and I know either of those are top-tier
* is the build quality advantage really that great when I'm probably going to slap a skin or a case on it (will 99% get a skin since I hate how bulky phones are with cases).
* Is the camera performance THAT much better on the S22?
I have no experience with any flagship phones, so It's kinda hard for me to decide in this case. They both seem so similar."	N
New video problems!	"Hello  
New problems - the microphone keeps cutting out while I am recording & audio-playback then fails if microphone is plugged in!  
BACKGROUND 
I am using:  
A) a good quality (Rode ""SmartLav+"") external wired microphone

B) A ""2-in-1 USB C to 3.5mm Headphone and Charger Adapter, by Bphuny""

C) Plus my Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra (on a tripod), running the ""Pro Video"" mode of the Samsung ""Camera"" app.   Problem 1. 
When I play a video back that HAS recorded sound, no sound comes out unless I unplug the microphone!  Problem 2. The microphone keeps cutting out. It even does this half way through recording a video. And this happens even though each time, before I start recording I am checking that microphone being selected is the External USB microphone.  In fact when I start recording a video,  a little message always pops up TELLING me that the Pro Video ""is using the external USB microphone to record"". 
- Do you any idea why the mic keeps cutting out?
i.e. How can I tell if this is a hardware or software problem? 
- And how can I get the phone to play sound on a video without my needing to unplug the mic?!

Looking to upgrade to S22U From OnePlus 8 5G(Verizon edition)	Hi, getting ready to upgrade from a OnePlus 8 5G UW. Is the S22 U worth it? I've heard some horror stories but I really like the idea of the phone. Battery and performance are very important to me, and the OnePlus isn't delivering any of that anymore. I'm looking for some advice to see if this is the right phone for me. My day consists of waking up at around 8:00 in the morning, checking YouTube and other social media until I leave my house for work at 9:30. When I get to work I use my phone with the screen off for pretty much the whole day to listen to podcasts on Spotify and YouTube with the screen off until I go home at around 5:00. When I get home, things change though. I watch a lot of YouTube and do some gaming here and there( cod mobile). I'm told that this phone has the perfect specs(snapdragon for me in US) for all of these things, but I'd like to hear your guy's opinions.	N

FIX for 90% of the Stutters and Scrolling Lag on Samsung Phones	"I have had this phone since April and it has been a stuttering mess for me with a lot of popular apps, especially social media apps like Twitter. So, I was glad when I stumbled on a solution; Samsung apps that are region locked, for example both of these are not available in Australia:
**Try to find these apps in the Galaxy Store first, as they might be available in your region:**
1. First, download and install the latest **Samsung Good Guardians** app, if you downloaded this through the **Galaxy Store**, you can download all other apps suggested below from within the Good Guardians app, otherwise grab the latest APK's from below: 
‚Äã[https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/samsung-electronics-co-ltd/galaxy-labs/](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/samsung-electronics-co-ltd/galaxy-labs/)‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã
Then:
2. Download and install the latest **Samsung Galaxy App Booster**
‚Äã[https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/samsung-electronics-co-ltd/app-booster/](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/samsung-electronics-co-ltd/app-booster/)
Run **Good Guardians**, and through that app, you run the **Galaxy App Booster**.
Using **Galaxy App Booster**, click on **OPTIMIZE NOW** and wait for it to complete the process.
Run this ""Optimize Now"" feature once a week. Enjoy.
That's it, that fixed most of my stutters when nothing else and no other optimizations done much these last few months. 
There still remains a little bit of stutter, but nowhere near as bad as before.
**EXTRA Information:**
3. I personally use **Samsung Thermal Guardian** too:
‚Äã[https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/samsung-electronics-co-ltd/samsung-thermal-guardian/](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/samsung-electronics-co-ltd/samsung-thermal-guardian/)
Using **Thermal Guardian**, I increase the **Thermal Threshold** to maximum (*click the + sign a couple of times*). This allows the CPU to run at hotter temperatures, however, I also use **Additional Settings** to ""*Limit CPU Boosting when Heating*"", this prevents the CPU from over-heating. What I have found, is that these two combined allow the CPU to run between 70% and 90% power, giving an overall more fluid performance, without over-heating.
4. If you have used the information in #3, then I also set **Processing Speed** to **Maximum**, when combined with Limited Boosting, it provides a better overall experience. To activate Maximum Processing Speed, go to device **Settings**, then ""*Battery and Device Care*"", then ""*Battery*"", then ""*More battery settings*"", then ""*Processing Speed*"", then set to ""*Maximum*""."

Anyone with XAG as their CSC?	"I have an S22U U1 unlocked, and I'm using a cellular provider called Net10 (T-Mobile sim) which assigned me XAG as my CSC after initially putting in my sim card. I know I've read many people with Mint Mobile also have this CSC, and I'm guessing possibly other T-Mobile MVNO's (at least on U1 variant).
I don't care what CSC my sim uses as long as it gets updates, which is the problem im trying to bring up. I was getting updates perfectly fine and on time with the other U1 CSC's up until August. XAG is still stuck on July, even though every other CSC has been updated, including XAA (default).
What i ended up doing was putting in another Net10 spare sim I had laying around that was using AT&amp;T towers and gave me CSC XAR. XAR had the update so I was able to update to the August patch and then put back in my main sim to have the CSC go back to XAG. 
My question is, is this normal? Is anyone else using a sim with XAG csc? There's not even anyone to reach out to about when the CSC will get updates, since the whole update system is so convoluted with how many entities are involved. I'm just posting to see if anyone else has experienced this, and if anyone knows whether or not this will be fixed moving forward, so I don't have to keep putting in a different sim card to update my phone. Thanks!"	N

Samsung s22 plus case and screen protector I need help	"Hey guys I wanted to ask is there a case for the s22 plus that makes the bezels appear symmetrical?

Switch from S22+ to Z flip 4?	Hey Z flip owners. I'm currently debating trading in my S22+ for a Z flip 4 for the sole reason of getting a galaxy watch 5 and its cheaper to get it with the Flip and trade in rather than buying the watch standalone. I'm most concerned about the durability of the folding screen and many long terms reviews of the flip 3 suggest that the screen starts to deteriorate after 6 months or so and it's very probable that I would have to replace the screen once or twice during its lifetime. Please suggest if I should pull the trigger or wait for some more deals on just the watch. Thanks!	N
Anyone Else Going From the S22 Ultra to the Z Flip 4?	"I pre-ordered a Z Flip 4 on Samsung's website and am anxiously waiting it to arrive next week. I really like my S22 Ultra. The camera is great, and the screen is amazing. But I hardly use the S Pen, and the phone is pretty big in my pocket. 
I've heard the Z Flip 4 has nice battery life, and I really like the idea of folding it shut to become more compact. Just my thoughts so far."	N
Fold4 impressions (from Fold3 &amp; S22U user) AMA	"**Fold4 impressions (from Fold3 and S22U user)**
**Performance:**
Very fast, compared to places in which the Fold3 and the S22U (exynos) would lag, it is not seen. Phone heat dissipation is very good. Latest processor Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 makes this phone behave more premium. I tested several games on it (Call of Duty, Fortnite) and did not experienced any lags. Phone didnt get too hot (only warmer) after a long gaming session.
**Battery life:**
Due to this newer processor, I noticed the standby power usage is minimal, on par with iPhones (the industry best in standby usage). I use mine in 5G all day, bluetooh on, wifi at home and use all range of apps, from GPS apps (Waze, Here maps) to media consumption (Apple Music, Youtube, etc). You could say I am a power user, and this phone lasts me the whole day.
**Phone design, built quality and sturdiness:**
I found the shape much better than the Fold3, it is easier to hold and also not as slippery, thanks to a frosted glass back cover. The shape also is much better for one hand usage, for some reason I see the Fold3 being to be much taller.
**Screen quality:**
Maybe is a placebo effect, but my perception is that both inner and outer screens are much more bright (increased knits perhaps?). Also the inner screen, the crease is much less noticeable, and comparing running my finger to feel the crease, it is much less noticeable compared with Fold3. Is still there, I reckon the change in the gap (Fold4 bigger glap than Fold3) helped a lot with this factor.
**Camera (The most important defining factor for me):**
The camera is finally a 2022 camera, same optics as a S22 or S22+. The 3X optical zoom is great, much better camera optics than 2019's optics used in Fold3.
The 10X digital zoom is quite good and in good lightning conditions I should say is as good as the optical 10X on my S22 Ultra. Perhaps Samsung tweaked the AI for photo processing? 
I am in love with this camera and happy Samsung improved this so much. It was one of my biggest grieves in the Fold3 and the reason I got the S22U.
**Colour choice:** 
I went with the Beige, very subtle and great colour choise. Most of my phones are usually white or cream/gold colours. I believe the colour choice in Fold3 was boring and unimpressive (the silver is too silvery and fingerprint magnet).
**Samsung latest accessory availability:**
Also impressed that Samsung is finally bringing foldables to the masses. I got the Standing case with S-Pen, but I am aware a large variety exists. Also third party vendors are bringing tons of options, some classic and discreet, others very fashionable. I like that approach. 
**Future proof:**
I believe this phone can easily last 2-3 years, even more if battery is not degraded too aggressively. I've tested other tech like NReal Air AR glasses with it, using Dex all feels very smooth.
**Final remarks**
A great phone, I'm very satisfied with this purchase and would maybe ask Samsung to improve both the front selfie and inner under-display cameras as well as considering adding a pen silo like the S22U or Galaxy Note lineup. But those are not critical requests like a better battery or Camera like we did in the Fold3. 
**Feel free to ask me anything.**"	N
S22 Ultra 5G issue	Wondering if anyone else in my area is haveing 5g network issue's or knows a fix to resolve this problem. Live in Denver and work in Aurora. I have the 5g get more plan and have had great 5g service since i got this phone. Starting last Monday my S22 has 5g network issue. It will either show no service or show 5G signal but still have zero internet. If im connected to 4g lte it works fine but as soon as it switches to 5g it stops working. My wife has the S21 and has complained about her cell service this week but it doesnt seem to be as bad. Took both phones outside today and here phone turned to 5g and was getting 300+ mb download but mine never switched to 5G and stayed on 4g lte and was getting around 100 mb download. Done all the usual troubleshooting and put a ticket in. Tier 2 tech text saying network coverage isnt optimal and closed the ticket so not much help. Currently switch my preferred network to 4Lte so i dont lose service.	N
S22 Ultra "Network Mode" gone?	I wanted to turn 5g off to preserve battery and possibly keeping the phone temp low. In Mobile Networks apparently you can disable 5g in Network Mode but this doesn't appear on my phone. I just traded in my S9 for this so I'm new to this, was there an update maybe that changed the location?	N
Samsung S22 Ultra first full day of ownership (slight buyers remorse)	"Just picked up my S22 Ultra yesterday morning, and have been messing around with it since. Unfortunately, this phone has already been a huge disappointment. Now dont get me wrong, theres alot of things i do like, but man theres alot of stuff that sucks. First off, maybe its my fault for making the mistake of getting the one with ""only"" 8 GB ram. But this phone feels slow. Animations and stuff like that are fine (kind of, they like to lag alot) but most apps feel way slower. The camera shutter is super slow, loading in apps seems slow, it loves to have random lag spikes when opening the running apps window, or closing apps, scrolling, snapchat is unbelievably bad, youtube, reddit, play store all feel kind of slow and have frequent lag spikes. I always close apps as soon as im done with them, so theres not a bunch of stuff running in the background. The camera is good, but really doesnt seem better than when i compare it to my gf's 13 Pro Max. 100x zoom is nice, but taking a picture at 100x zoom produces the same quality as zooming in fully on the 13 Pro Max and then zooming in on the picture. The camera also looks HORRIBLE in low light. Customization is obviously pretty in depth, at least with Good Lock and apps for that, but its kind of necessary as so much of the UI seems crappy and needs to be changed. Overall this phone doesnt feel like much of an upgrade and I'm coming from a 11 Pro Max. Im noticing all this stuff after just my first day, can only imagine how I will feel about it after I have it longer. Or I may just trade it for a 13 Pro Max. Am i going nutty or does anyone else feel the same way?
Also: one of the reasons I wanted an android was so I could play Morrowind on OpenMW. Worked great on my OnePlus 7 Pro, lags like crazy on this phone
Edit: forgot to mention the battery is literal trash. My 11 Pro Max with a battery health of 79% lasts longer. And people keep saying i got a knock off, no, i got it from my carrier, its just an extremely dissapointing phone"	N
galaxy s20 ultra vs Galaxy s22 ultra	"So I traded in my razr2 for $1,000 when it was only worth $500 (score!) And bought the galaxy s20 ultra 5g for $200. I love this phone and really don't want to get another but I was wondering what the difference was between the s20 ultra and s22 ultra. 
I mainly watch shows and play a gr that's pretty graphics intense due to the latest update and now most older devices can't even run it. I have looked up the specs and see that a few things improved but was wondering what people thought about it after having an s20 ultra."	N
Is the S22 Ultra worth the purchase?	As the title suggest, I'm really curious from the experience of S22 ultra users, is it worth the purchase? The S22 ultra is the best flagship Android offered at my country at a very good price, my other option is the Iphone 13 pro max but I'm not a keen fan of Apple. So I was wondering if it is worth the investment? I'm looking for a phone with superb performance, good battery life, excellent camera, excellent display, and enough software support. Performance is key for me, fluidity and smoothness is essential for me, and good enough to support games akin to Apex without being too overwhelm. It is also worth to note that my current phone is a mid-range from 2019-2020, not a flagship from recent yeara, so the leap from my current phone to the S22 ultra would be substantial. So I would like to know all of your opinions about it. Should I buy it, should I just stick to another mid-range from this year, or should I wait for the next flagship from Samsung?	N
S22 Ultra: underwhelming camera	"My biggest complaint is that images are extremely oversharpened and contrasty. Human skin looks like it was colored with pencils or crayons. The only way to fix this is to use the 108mp sensor with detail enhancer turned on. But for obvious reasons, that's not an ideal way to use the camera all the time.
Since my last post, I noticed yet another issue. During 60fps recording, there is extreme flickering. It seems a few other people in this community have also noticed it.
I should add that I'm still running the march software version, because I'm worried about the august update introducing battery issues (a bunch of people complained). And don't even think about blaming it on me for not updating. It's a fucking 2022 phone that i paid 1100$ for. I expect the absolute best straight out the box. It's a billion $ company with a team of pro devs. I'm sure they can do better. Don't sell the goddamn product if it's not finished yet. 
I was asked to show examples so here they are. I've made some pics with my old S8 and the Note 20U to compare.
The S8 cost me 700$ less and is 5 years older. Yet the differences are small and in some aspects the S8 is better. Shutter speed and autofocus are also a lot faster on the S8.
P.s you'll notice that the added text is sometimes just as blurry as the image itself, even though it was added after cropping. Probably another software bug. If anyone knows how to fix it let me know.
P.s.s.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è turns out imgur doesn't retain 100% image quality so all the images are now less sharp than they're supposed to be
‚óèExample of flickering (no there are no artificial lights on). Download the video before viewing or you won't see the flickering.

When will the UK get S22 with Snapdragon chip?	"Went to a phone store to look at some phones and pleasantly suprised by the fact that the Galaxy S22 isn't too big, right at my upper tolerance limit.
But I was warned at the store that the phone doesn't come with the renown Snapdragon chip, but rather the exynous that is having constant, constant complaints from customer and I was adived to wait for a revision, a 2nd version so that the snapdragon comes to the UK market.

S21+ vs S22	"choosing between S21+ and S22 and looking for advice
My beloved S9+ is slowly dying after 4+ years of service (full battery now gets me 2 hours of screen time) and I'm going with one of these two.
Idk why since they're fairly identical but I love the S22 design more. 
Other than that, S21+ seems to have the edge on the camera department, battery, screen size (obv).
Price would basically be the same.
So, logic would suggest the S21 plus, wouldn't it? But since I generally use my phone for at least 4 years I'm hesitant on buying a phone which came out almost 2 years ago, basically for updates.

For me the S22+ and Flip4 have the same price and I live in Europe meaning that I get the exynos version of the S22 phones.
One of the things I did like about the iPhone is the compact size, which made me consider the S22 and Flip4 over the S22+.
So what is a good one to get at the moment?"	N
Expert RAW app - What is it - When to use it	"Hi folks, 
I have heard a lot of folks that want to use the Expert RAW app - the advanced camera app from Samsung - to take photos, but want to know when and how to use the app. I thought I could share my thoughts here so it can help those who want to know more about the Expert RAW app. You can watch my video if you don't want to read the lengthy post below     
The Samsung camera app is powerful and has many options to choose from when you want to capture that moment, be it a photo or video. If you want more control, then the Pro mode puts the control in your hands, so you get the photo and video you want. But what if you wanted more control? Samsung‚Äôs Expert RAW app is an advanced camera app for the S21, S22, and Z Fold series. The Expert RAW app brings advanced photography features and controls, giving users greater access to the phone's cameras and better control over their photos. 
How does the Expert RAW app differ from the standard camera app? First, the Expert RAW is only available to S21 series, S22 series, and Z Fold3/4 series phones. Second, three main differences make the Expert RAW app a great utility for advanced photography.   Focus on photos The Expert RAW app supports only taking photos. You cannot record videos. This is both good and bad. Good in the sense that it's laser-focused on the goal, which is to help you take great photos. There are no distractions, not even different photo modes like single-take and portrait modes.   Advanced controls in your hands The advanced controls can manually adjust photo settings such as the ISO, shutter speed, exposure levels, focus, and white balance settings.This is where it is essential to know what these settings mean and how they affect your photo. Ok, let's go over them quickly!ISO controls camera light sensitivity. By increasing the ISO, you make your photos brighter. So, by manually adjusting the ISO, you can control how bright you want your photo to be.Shutter speed is the length of time the camera shutter is open while the camera takes a photo. The more time it is open, the more light will travel through the shutter.Exposure refers to the overall brightness of an image, which is determined by the amount of light that hits the camera sensor. So, higher values will result in over-exposed images, and lower values will result in under-exposed images. The Expert RAW app also has a histogram where you can see if your image is overexposed or underexposed - if the graph leans more toward the left, it's underexposed, and towards the right, it's overexposed.The focus option allows you to either manually adjust the focus points or automatically adjust them based on touch points in your camera.White balance allows you to adjust the color of your photo to match the light source. So, for example, you could adjust your photo to be of a warm color tone or cool depending on the day you take the photo.Now, that is a lot to digest. Try these settings one by one to see how it changes your photo. That is the best way to learn!The next advanced control you get is using a specific camera lens. For example, in my S22 Ultra, I can choose to shoot with ultra-wide-angle, wide angle, telephoto, or super telephoto lenses. Each one has its specific purpose. With the Expert RAW app, once you choose a lens, it will not automatically switch lenses when you zoom in on your subject - instead, it will zoom in using the selected lens. This is a big difference. When you use the standard camera app in Pro mode, the camera app will decide which lens to use and switch automatically.  So, with the Expert RAW app, you have total control.   Powerful RAW output Expert RAW is built around shooting in the RAW image format, complete with a wider dynamic range that produces more detail in bright and dark areas of a photo. This gives you control when editing these photos. These 16-bit RAW image files can be between 10MB and 30MB each - meaning they are large files!This brings up an important point. With the standard camera app, you can expect it to produce a great photo that you can share instantly with your friends and family. However, the RAW output from the Expert RAW app is not meant to be the greatest output but rather an output you can post-process and adjust the settings to produce the desired photo. Only then could you expect the photo to be of something share worthy!So, you will need apps that can edit RAW photos. Adobe LightRoom and Google Snapseed are some examples. I would recommend Google Snapseed as it is free, but if you have Lightroom, that is great too! Let's take a look. 
Would love to know if you are using the Expert RAW app. What do you think so far?"	N

S22 Ultra photos are pixelated when zoomed in/stand-by battery drain	" 
Hi to everyone, recently I switched to Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra Exynos version (I'm in the UK) 256GB model. I have a few things which I do not understand so I am looking for help.  
Here are a few photos. When not pixel peeping they actually look really nice and beautiful, but when zooming in they look really pixelated and blurry, you cannot see the small details. Is this a software/hardware problem for me? I can provide more photos if needed, I do not have anymore but I can take some.
This is my first question, the second one leads to battery usage: stand-by battery drain time is horrible, I lost 20% of battery in 9 hours while I was asleep. Why is that happening? I can't give opinion about Screen on Time because the battery just learnt my daily habits and patterns and I am still using it, but that seems to be a bit better, although not perfect, we'll see, I don't want to say anything in advance about that. Any tips and suggestions?
If it matters: Exynos version, 256GB model, highest screen resolution, adaptive brightness, AOD from 10pm-7am (turned it off now). Thank you for any tips and suggestions!

Samsung One UI 5.0 Beta 2 New Icons!		N
Just upgraded from the Galaxy S10. I have two major issues.	"Besides the obvious lack of a headphone jack and SD card that the S10 which can be worked around, these two are genuinely making me consider returning my phone and sticking with my S10 until these are resolved or my S10 dies.
1. Vibration intensity. I know it's because of a hardware change but it's so bad. I'm constantly missing notifications, even when the phone is right next to me on my desk. I also use only the vibration for my alarm, and I didn't hear it in the morning. Hopefully Samsung changes this for the S23. MKBHD's reviews of the [S22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWIkBMNKj1s&amp;) and [S22 Ultra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXIAB_1FEC0) criticizing it alone got a combined 10.3 million reviews so it got a lot of attention.
2. The lack of a button on the left side. The bixby button remapped with bxactions on the S10 is so good. I single tap to go back, double tap to change apps, and long press for the flashlight all the time but that option isn't available here. The S22U is a much bugger phone and I have to reach down and swipe. Changing apps may be manageable because I can use the sidebar, but the back button is a big loss. And I can change the double tap the side button for the flashlight but I'd rather that be for the camera.
Edit: #2 is almost a non-issue with Good Lock and One Handed Operation. Need to get used to us though."	N

Dbrand Grip Case	"The Dbrand Grip Case has now surpassed the UAG civilian case as my case of choice for my S22 Ultra. 
I went with the matte black skin for now, but I love the fact I could switch up the look of this case by just slapping on a new skin to it!
What I love most is the thin feeling it gives, 
The case is only a few mm thick, and curves with the glass snugly, on other cases I've noticed that the sides can be pulled free from the phone, not so with this case!
The case also comes up flush with the camera modules, so the case does not rock on tables. 
The sides have a micro texture to them, making the case grippy but not overly so, the lower third of both sides have angled rubber fins that smoothly stick to your hand while holding also. 
TL;DR 
The Dbrand Grip Case is an amazing case that grips well and I should have made this my first choice!"	N
US - if you have refused delivery on a device that you got from Samsung with a trade in, how did it go?	"I got an instant discount for a trade in on my order but I would like to refuse delivery. I'm concerned that because of the trade-in it might cause problems.
I have not received the new device yet I was going to refuse delivery and then it will be sent back. Will that cancel the trade-in automatically? I haven't even received the device and they're already sending me emails welcoming me to the trade-in program.

Finally got the network/mobile data issues fixed.	"Ever since the August update, the connectivity issues on my S22 Ultra made it impossible to use the phone for mobile data, hotspot or phone calls. I visited a Samsung service center. They installed a new firmware which did not fix the issue.
&amp;#x200B;
Went back to the center and they told me that the motherboard would need to be changed. Later on, they actually fixed the problem and told me that it was a connector-related issue. They also said that once the repair is done, the water resistance re-application could cause the back glass to have discoloration (it happened with my previous Note 9 during a battery replacement). I was firm to tell them that this is a manufacturing issue from your end and I want my device is the exact pristine condition. If there is discoloration, replace the back glass. Furthermore, the service center did not issue a service number even after I asked for the same multiple times. I was supposed to receive the phone after 7 days. 
&amp;#x200B;
Being dissatisfied with the service experience, I  escalated the issue with the regional service head and also put in an email to Samsung's CEO (available on their website). Got my phone back tomorrow, just within 4 days and now it works without any problems.
&amp;#x200B;
Users who are facing network issues should definitely visit Samsung's service center. Based on my experience, the network related problem is also present on other Samsung devices as well, as I saw a lot of users complaining and their devices are now out of warranty. Hope this helps."	N

There has to be a better way	"I play the piano. Can stretch an octave + 2 keys. But I shouldn't have to jump through hoops to turn the phone off.
OK, so my last phone has been a Note. Perfect in many ways for me so I just kept it. If I want to play games, I use my PC. Camera? Have one of them, too.
But the Note finally died (tho I must say, it finally got better after I bought the Ultra. Really. I swear it feels abandoned.)
Who was the idiot that decided I had to press a volume key and a side key to turn this thing off?!!! With the Note, I didn't need any pressure to press the right key and I got the Phone Options menu immediately. What is the reason for making it so hard? Because somebody wanted congratulations for designing something new?
Please tell me there's a better way. Googling hasn't found anything. I have to turn the phone sideways for my thumb to press both at once. If I use 2 hands, I'm running the risk of dropping it. Sorry, I'm not a man. My fingers are smaller. Doesn't matter, anyway. Even if I hold the phone against me and use both hands to hit the 2 keys, I get Bixby. Not the Power screen. And sometimes I get the insulting directions ""Press and hold the side and volume down keys."" NO KIDDING ! And if they're going to bother to tell me that, why don't they let me press the OK button and it boots then?
Please tell me there's a better way."	N

Note taking with the S Pen and S22 Ultra	"One of the questions that I always see many ask is, what are the best note-taking apps to use with the S Pen? Well, I used a few apps and came down to three that provide an excellent note-taking experience with the S Pen and S22 Ultra. 
- Samsung Notes 
- Post-It 
- OneNote 
The good thing about these apps is that they are all free! While OneNote will allow you to take notes with your S Pen, it is the only app that doesn't integrate with the S Pen button or actions. The rest two have good integration. 
My preference is Samsung Notes. It has the best S Pen experience packed with valuable features like PDF annotation that you can use to write on top of PDF, a distraction-free writing canvas, and more!

Horrible Support from Samsung Care: Cracked Screen	"So when I ordered my 22U, I added on Samsung Care because shit happens. Well, it did happen when my screen unexplainably cracked while at dinner (everyone at the table was like 'huh? how did that happen, you just used it.'). So I went through the process to have the screen replaced. Guess what. No screens anywhere. Then Samsung said, 'A phone replacement is on back order. 3-4 weeks'. Seriously. What am I going to do without a phone for 3-4 weeks? Hit up Verizon and they found one with my specs within 30 miles. Had to go BUY a new phone because Samsung didn't have any screens or replacement phones available.
I still filed the claim in mid July because I own it outright. Weeks have gone by and not a single replacement or screen to be found. Called local repair stores and they can't get any screens either. I finally got someone yesterday at Samsung, after being routed all over their 'service' tree multiple times- including TWO hang ups. They're going to refund me market value plus the value of my trade in.
As much as I love my 22U, I doubt I will buy another Samsung phone. Their service has been HORRIBLE. And if they can't guarantee replacement parts or phone (yes, I know about production shortages), it's basically a scam to buy new ones.
Has anyone else had this happen with a claim?"	N
Patches on borders of screen?	"Hello. I might have a problem with my S22 ultra, I'm not sure yet. I had it since day0.
Anyway today i realized that on the left side, in the curved screen area, i have few lines/patches that arent really white, its like yellowish/light brown, it's hard to even say the color. At first I thought it was the screen protector, but I cleared it and its not that. It's either the screen protector itself that changed color in that area, something between the screen protector and the screen (but i never removed it since day0) or the screen itself.
Anyone else had a similiar problem? Ive had many tpu cases that changed color after months, but it's never happened before to me that the screen protector itself changed the color.
I'll have to remove the screen protector to be sure, but before doing that i wanted to know if someone else had a similiar experience. Thank you!"	N

Thoughts on Tenpered Glass Screen Protectors	"So I've been looking for a tempered glass screen protector for my S22U, and have found everyone reccomending the Whitestone Dome, AmFilm, and Mowei protectors. However, reading some amazon reviews leads me to believe that there are issues with all of the above. For Whitestone Dome, people say theirs started cracking a short time later without having dropped it, and on the Mowei people complain that the stickers didn't keep the liquid adhesive out of the earpiece speaker grill. On all glass screen protectors, people seem to have mixed results with fingerprint scanner functionality. 
Which protector should I really go for and how worried should I be about the possibility of getting the adhesive inside the earpiece speaker grill?"	N

Will my DC car charger hurt my S22 Ultra?	"I bought a new S22 Ultra yesterday and the salesman mentioned something about USB to USB-C cords could damage the battery on the phone.  I understand salesmen have all kinds of nonsense pitches to sell you Samsung branded accessories but I wanted to know what you guys think?
1.  Can I use the generic Amazon USB to USB-C charging cable I was using on my S10+?
2.  Can I use my Amazon DC to USB (and then a USB to USB-C cord) car adapter to charge my S22 Ultra?
3.  What about using a power bank to charge my phone?  Will this hurt it?
Will either of these situations have any real impact on battery life over the course of 2-3 years until I need to buy another phone?  I take it I might be overly paranoid just because of what a salesman said.  I doubt Samsung would produce a phone that could be so easily damaged in so many places people are used to charging their phone."	N
Note taking with the S Pen and S22 Ultra	"Hi folks,
One of the questions that I always see many ask is, what are the best note-taking apps to use with the S Pen? Well, I used a few apps and came down to three that provide an excellent note-taking experience with the S Pen and S22 Ultra. 
\- Samsung Notes
\- Post-It 
\- OneNote
The good thing about these apps is that they are all free! While OneNote will allow you to take notes with your S Pen, it is the only app that doesn't integrate with the S Pen button or actions. The rest two have good integration. 
My preference is Samsung Notes. It has the best S Pen experience packed with valuable features like PDF annotation that you can use to write on top of PDF, a distraction-free writing canvas, and more!
If folks are interested, here is [my video walking you through these three apps](https://youtu.be/XfGzDk0o820).

Help: S-Pen issues!	"Help: S-Pen (some) air actions working, but not touch?
Title describes the issue. When I remove the S-Pen, I can't seem to use the touch function, only air.

Going from iPhone 13 mini to‚Ä¶s22 ultra. What have I done üòÇ	"I‚Äôve been using iPhones for years now, typically I would get plus models. Last year I was extremely stressed and was having some fibromyalgia type pain, and from the stress and short-sightedness I got the 13 mini. Not long after I totally hated the size and missed my plus. Then my pain went away completely when my stress decreased and hasn‚Äôt been back in 8 months. 
The last few months I started using linux and learning python at a new job. It‚Äôs  where I do most of my computing, and I really like it, to the point now windows feels foreign and inconvenient. Combining this and the size of my phone, I began to just hate the Apple ui and lack of customization. So much. I don‚Äôt like Apple ID either. Anyway I would look at my husbands s21+ and I loved it. I‚Äôve been thinking about switching seriously for weeks now and I finally pulled the trigger on it, samsung has a decent deal on it right now. My arm is gonna be tired I bet and I think my coworkers will be like ‚Äúwtf is that‚Äù but I‚Äôm really excited :). I figure if I hate it there‚Äôs no harm in switching to the 22+."	N

I'm leaning a but more towards the s22 cause it's got a smaller screen and it's $400 cheaper. The flip has the cool factor definitely but I know it's gonna feel almost as large as my s22U when opened.	N
Asus ZenFone 9 or Samsung S22 Plus or Flip 4	"Guys, just want good phone with reasonable compact size, good battery and good camera. 
I know that S22 Plus is the best option, but the size is not compact. It has really good camera and battery. And DeX. But the price is still high, but for the features and the support, maybe It is okay. 
For ZenFone 9 - it has a great battery life, compact size, 3.5 mm headphone jack, but decent camera and 2 years only of support
Flip 4 - really compact and has good battery, but camera is not good and don't have DeX. The price is high.

ONE UI 5 Beta battery drain and overheating	"First let me say I finally got into the Beta program last week and overall I feel like this is the experience the phone should have shipped with. 
It's snappier, smoother, and overall more stable than previous software with One UI 4. Battery life has also improved greatly. 
Today I ran into a strange issue. 
I fully charged the phone then let it sit idle while we cleaned the house and tended to the kiddos. 
When I picked it up 5 hours later battery had drained to 15% and the phone was very hot to the touch. 
I checked my battery app and the battery temp was 105.4*F üî•
It's never gotten this hot before.

Google photos back up question	On my previous devices, if I didn't select any folders in Google photos to back up, it would ONLY back up photos taken with my camera.

This seemed fine until a few weeks back when I noticed the phone wasnt at 100% by 8am. Yes, 15% is talking more than an hour and a half.

Thank you for the good times.	"Leaving this subreddit. Having the Fold4 for the past couple days and it instantly clicked with me. I love the form factor and the ability to do one handed activities again. The phone feels premium as hell, but the increased performance and above average battery consistency are too great for me to ignore. 
This is a near 10 for me for what I've been looking for in a mobile device. Just missing built in S pen and front screen pen support to make it perfect.
22Ultra was enjoyable but a disappointment from the start from pre-order to the last day I had it. Samsung's trade in deal was too enticing to ignore and they knocked it out of the park with the Fold4. 
My biggest deal breaker for 22U were:
‚óè SOT between 4-5 hours average. That's just horrible. Sometimes even barely breaking 4. 
‚óè Poor haptic feedback. I could never feel the phone vibrate in my pocket or in my jacket missing calls and texts. 
‚óè Curved Screen design was irritating to take notes on and made buying a screen protector unnecessarily expensive for no reason. 
‚óè Poor speaker output with ""tin"" sounding speakers. 
‚óè Phone gymnastics during one hand use made me feel like I had my 12Pro Max again.
It was a great rebranding, but the battery life was just to much of a deal breaker personally for a flagship device.

N
Returning Z Fold 4 and going back to S22 Ultra.	"This will have been my third attempt at using the Fold series. I figured this would be it finally, but I just can't do it.
Each time, I really wanted to like the Fold. Each time I used it for only a day or so before I had to stop lying to myself and go back to a prior device.
It's just still not good enough. Far too many compromises. Real-world compromises, too. Not just things that require re-learning.
A few things that really gave me problems:
* **Cover screen still far too small**
Even though it's not ideal, the fact that the S Pen doesn't work with the cover screen is disappointing. I had never thought to even ask that question until I found out by accident that this is the case.
* **Side-mounted fingerprint sensor**
I've never liked this placement and the newest Fold didn't change my mind any. It works great, for sure, but it's just not in the most ergonomic spot, and feels like a regression from the futuristic in-display fingerprint sensor. I found it awkward to press as well. It feels sunken in to the rail, especially with a case on, and I'd occasionally mistake the volume keys for it. It also interferes with the double press camera launch. I know I can access the camera other ways, but I prefer it as double pressing the side key as it's available at all times.
* **Aspect ratio**
This is still a big problem with this device. It's just not the right size. There is a right size out there, but this just isn't it. I've put the same video on my S22 Ultra as the Z Fold 4 and it's hardly any bigger on the Fold. A lot of wasted real estate. And when the main draw is supposed to be the *extra* real estate you get when the device is unfolded, it's a bit of a swing and a miss. The cover display suffers from this as well.
* **Janky software**
The software has improved with each iteration, but it's still not good enough. I found numerous instances of text and images being cut off, resizing one app only to mess with a different app. Trying the screen zoom in an attempt to fix one bit of text but then screw up another. Some apps still require restarting when you open or close the device.
* **No built-in S Pen**
I'm just so used to being able to pull out the pen whenever I need it. It's an annoyance having to carry it separately. The S Pen case that is given with the purchase is a great attempt at a solution, but it still falls short. It makes the whole unit comically bulbous. I know it uses a special S Pen, and I know not to use any other S Pens on that inner display, but I often use my S7+ S Pen at home and even though I'm a careful person, I still already made the mistake of using it on the inner display. Thankfully the warning saved the phone from any possible damage. I think the only way to comfortably use the device is without a case, and that's quite risky, as much as I believe in the surprising durability of the Fold.
* **No dust resistance**
I understand how tough it would be to get a foldable to be dust resistant and that it's amazing enough it's water resistant. But the fact that I just can't be quite as careless with the device as I'd like isn't comforting.
I didn't test out the cameras really, so I can't say how they compared to the S22 Ultra. I've read that they're not as good, and I'm sure that's the case. I'm sure they produce perfectly acceptable results.
It's not all bad, I did like many things about the Fold:
* **Inner display**
The main feature, of course. Despite it not being the right size to watch videos, it was sure glorious looking at pictures, browsing web pages, texting. I'm not one to mind the crease whatsoever. I don't understand that constant concern about it. It's not really perceptible when you're just using the device. If you're staring at a black screen, looking for the crease, sure it might bother you then...
* **Satisfying to open and close**
I sure do love the feeling when opening the device up and having that big screen greet me. And then closing it with that *clack* sound is addicting. But these are just frivolous points in favor of the device.
* **Battery life**
Very good, probably a touch better than the S22 Ultra (Snapdragon), which is quite a surprise. The new chip does a good job with efficiency.
As I was getting used to my new Fold, I still had my S22 Ultra sitting around, waiting to be packaged and shipped to complete the trade-in. But after using the Fold for maybe an hour or so, the S22 Ultra felt way more comfortable when I went back to check something on it. It somehow felt more luxurious, and in an odd sense. I felt like I had more screen at my disposal. In an effort to acclimate to the Fold for hopefully an extended period, I was trying to become more familiar with using the cover display. But, it just...it just sucks. It really does. It's nearly useless. It's cramped and goofy looking. It looks like it's from 2007. Another thing that couldn't be ignored was how thin the S22 Ultra felt in comparison. Of course, the Fold is quite a fatty when it's closed, and as I said, I was trying to get used to using it more while it's closed, like a normal phone. But it's just so uncomfortable.
It was around this point I realized I just couldn't do it with the Fold. I truly like the S22 Ultra much more. It almost pained me to admit that, because I love new tech and I was anxiously awaiting my Fold to come in for weeks, thinking this was surely the time it would stick. But once I knew I was giving up on the Fold and returning to my S22 Ultra, I felt such relief. It's so much more comfortable, and I've got all the stuff back that I was upset to give up. The In-display sensor, the big beautiful (cover?) display. The outstanding cameras with their otherworldly zoom. The built-in S Pen. And even enhanced durability. Not to mention my Ultra is the 1TB model, and the Fold I got was 512GB. The performance difference is negligible.
Now don't get me wrong, there are people out there who really like their Fold, and all the power to them. I guess it's just not for me. So I've already initiated a return and the Fold will be heading back. I'll take a loss on the accessories I got alongside it, but I'd rather do that and keep my S22 Ultra."	N

How to save best on buying s23u in future	"Hello, 
I created topic about exynos vs snapdragon version, watched some videos and read stuff and its sad that europe version of s22u is worse than america and having another chipset. This is why my main target will be s23u with tmsc chipset beast. The thing is now I can take from second hand but brand new s22u for 800 euro. The release on s23u will be in february - march probably. I checked tradein options for new fold phones and they give 800$ for s22u when trading in. This is why I have consider if it is not worthy to take now s22u for this 800 euro, use it for half year and having in mind I will trade in it when s23u will be release. I dont have much experience with benefiting from sales like that so I am looking for advice here. Am I thinking well with this idea and I can grab s22u and use it for half year almost for free or my point of few has flaws here?"	N

Durability Of S22 ULTRA	Hello friends, how are you! I bought the s22 ultra 256gb recently. I have been enjoying its sophistication, design, battery and UI experience a lot so far. I found typing using S pen harder though. Also I have been anxious and conscious about causing any scratches to the Phone. It's too Young. Even yet to get a cover. I got it for my portland trip. Was wondering what do you think about its toughness? Please let me know your thoughts. So long!	N

Any Decent Videography Apps?	"I've tried Filmic Pro, but it's noisy, bakes in sharpening only on the main camera, 10-bit video messes up the color (huge color shifts, high contrast look), and ""Log"" really isn't Log.  Also tried MotionCam for RAW video, but it only uses the wide and main cameras.   If one day it allows the 3x tele, too, I'd probably stick to that (I have a 512GB S22U), but today's not that day.  
The stock app in Pro Video mode seems the best so far, capturing very clean, smooth footage, with lightly recoverable shadows, though it oversharpens everything like crazy.  It's obvious the sharpening is only for the phone screen, as viewing it 1:1 on a desktop shows extremely wide sharpening halos, which anyone withjust 1 week of photo/video editing training would be ashamed of.  I can mostly undo that with Topaz Video Enhance AI, but it takes a lot of time to process (about 1.3fps), and sometimes leads to artifacts.  
Anything else out there that I should give a look at?  My main needs are 4K60 for all usable cameras, at least wide, main, and 3x telephoto cameras available, and full manual exposure/WB control."	N
Any Clear Hard Plastic Cases With Perfect or Near Perfect Camera Cutouts?	"I have thought about getting this case (link below) however I noticed that it yellow's very quickly in the reviews and it's more of the softer kind of plastic, almost rubber from images.

I haven't been able to find a case yet because they all looks terrible when it comes to the camera cutout. It has to be clear as I have ordered a skin for my Ultra. If you're needing more info on my needs I am more than happy to provide more information to what I would like. Anyways, thank you for the time and help!

Overheating resulting in no charging with Samsung charger	"Hi, today I encountered strange thing when sharing an internet connection through the WiFi router option - when my Exynos S22 is plugged in with Samsung charger it's got this super fast charging, but generating so much heat in addition to the heat generated from the router function, that the phone is not actually charging.
Things looks different with my Baseus charger, which supports this fast charging technology (not ""super"" one). Phone charges slower, but it's actually charging. The heat is also present, but somehow the power control in the phone permits the charging.
Are we getting to this point of absurd, when there's no point in buying brand accessories?"	N

I never noticed me trying hard to see whats on the screen for the pixel series and when I switched even with extra bright on it just seems dim and I'm constantly have to look at it real close to figure out whats on the screen even though S22 is supposed to be one of the brightest screen phone on the market..

s22 ultra to zflip 4....day 2	"So will probably get a lot of down votes and staments saying this is a downgrade but I am loving the zflip. I love how compact it is and don't mind the compromise in losing the telephoto lens and screen size. Call me crazy but I almost find the zflip screen text a little more crisp but the photos definitely look better on a s22 ultra.
Battery life for me has been similar.
Only real concern so far is wireless charging takes longer than the s22 ultra. Not a huge concern as if I'm in a rush I just plug it in.
In the end the portability/pocketability was worth it for me.....if I change my mind I can always trade it in for the s23 ultra next year!"	N
Considering S22 ultra upgrade from OP7Pro	"Hello
Ive had a 7PRO since it came out, great phone but I would like to change now
Basically by slapping promos on top of other ones I can get the S22 ultra for around 550-600 euros by also trading my old phone.
I was considering the Xiaomi 12pro, that I can also get for much(much) cheaper, around 100-200 bucks because in my country rn Xiaomi are having a big promotion.
Anyway, would you guys say its worth the upgrade for the price? I dont want to spend 600 bucks if the next one turns out to be much better.
I like the Xiaomi too but the screen difference is quite noticeable when you have both in hand, its clearly bigger on the s22 ultra.
Any thoughts?

S22U (Exynos) to Z Fold 4 - Performance difference	"Made the switch yesterday and immediately noticed that the Z Fold is just WAY more snappier and responsive than my S22U - which was already better than on launch day thanks to the updates and the [XDA Optimization Guide](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/samsung-galaxy-optimization-guide-battery-performance-stability-heat.4376755/) after a factory reset.  
I decided to keep the Fold (despite the S22U has the built-in SPen and the 10x Camera), because the user experience is just way better.  
Is this something thanks to the 8+ Gen 1 or also the Software (12L)?"	N

S22 Ultra Battery Issues?	Hello everyone! I've been am iPhone user since the iPhone 4, but I switched over to the S22 Ultra a few months ago, right when it released. The battery has been quite sub par. I get 5 hours of screen on time max, which for me isn't great at all, especially considering what I paid for this. I BARELY get through an entire day. I first thought it would learn from my usage patterns but it didn't really get any better. Is there any way I could resolve or make this issue better? Because I really do love this phone, but battery is a make or break for me..	N

S22 Ultra Battery and Lifespan concerns	Everything about the phone is spot on, except the battery. The battery is said by most to be kind of bad with low SoT, and this would result in going through more battery cycles and the phone won't last as long as let's say an iPhone 13s battery would. I really like the phone though, so I dont know what to do. I'm a heavy user as well. The phone also comes with a galaxy watch 4, which is also one of the main reasons I'm struggling between choosing either an iPhone 14 or the S22 Ultra.	N
S22Ultra: the battery is weird yo	"I'm not really complaining, I've got decent battery life on it. Between 8% and 12% per hour. But that's exactly the weird part. It varies every day. Sometimes during the day even. Today for example, I've been on reddit and tiktok, both are apps that generally drain my battery at around 11% per hour. Yet for some reason the drain has been at 9%/h for the past 2 hours. 
Edit: after posting this i checked and it dropped to 8.5 lmao. Edit #2 holy shit it dropped to 7.2/hr.
So what I'm saying is that the battery drain is not constant, even though my usage IS. Same apps, same settings, same battery levels, same environmental temperatures, same charging patterns same everything. Even the temperature readings of the phone are mostly constant, _however_, this can also vary sometimes for reasons that i don't understand.
Some days, the phone will be idle at 38 deg C and it'll stay that way for hours. Other days, I'll be using reddit and it's at 32. Strange.
Adaptive battery is off. 5G is also off (btw switching 5G off did not make a difference in battery drain. At all.)"	N
S22 plus doesn't seem like good value this year	"Last year the s21 plus had a 6.7 inch screen with 4800mah. It was basically a cheaper s21 ultra without the cameras. That was pretty good savings for losing the cameras.
This year the s22 plus got downgraded to 6.6 inches 4500mah. So now for $200 more you get better cameras,  noticeable bigger screen,  significant battery gains, the s-pen in the phone. The did up the brightness to match the ultra at least but in general its a letdown."	N
Is the Galaxy s22+ battery life really that much better than the s22?	I've watched some reviews on both phones and I wanna buy the s22. The battery life is concerning though and I wonder if the s22+ battery life is that much better. In most battery comparisons, the s22 seems to be doing fine, with the s22+ only surviving for maybe half an hour more. Why do people roast the s22 battery life like there's no tomorrow when the s22+ is only a little better?	N
Upgrading from S10+ to S22+ or Flip 4? Or stay?	"Since Samsung has a fairly decent trade-in deals I am considering upgrading my Samsung S10+ since the battery life is getting rather sad and I could use a bit better camera.
My questions are 
Is S22+ worth upgrading to from S10+?
If I am upgrading, should I go for Flip4 or S22+?
What are the biggest positives of having a flipphone compared to the standard 'brick '?
Should I just try to push one more year from my S10+?
The price for me is more or less the same between Flip4 and S22+.
I know there are no definitive or right answers but I am looking forward to hearing some opinions.
PS: Haven't used a flip phone since 00s."	N

Exynos S22U	Hello guys. I really love the camera system, the disgn, the S Pen and the display of my S22 Ultra. But what I do not like is to overheating and poor battery life. My phone is just laying in cool room, doing nothing just having some apps open in RAM and it starts getting warm. Outside is max 31C (88F), I have tgha phone in pocket, all apps closed, olny data and Bluetooth turned on and it is going to be really really hot and the battery life really poor. I was yesterday the whole day at home and my SOT was only 4 hours and 35 minutes. Today I am now on 81% with SOT of 1 hour and 30 minutes. When I got that phone back in May I think everything was OK. but now? I am really start thinking of leaving it but for what? I do not want to go back to iOS. I would try to wait till S23U and hope that Snapdragon would be in all S23. I woul switch to Z Flip4 which has better battery life with smaller batter thanks to 8+ Gen 1 CPU, or I would switch to A53 because midrange phones are not that power hungry which I can say about my backup Mororola Edge 20 with 778G and Pixel GSI. It is faster and of course coller than S22U. Looks like stock Android make difference. Or I should switch to new Pixel when it arrive or going for Xiaomi 12X which has less power hungry 870 or wait for OnePlus 10T which also has 8+ Gen 1. I feel totaty lost. I am doing maximum to keep S22U cooler, I use Therma Guardian and Battery Guardian, but it feels like nothing works.	N

Using Separate Sound App (or any alternatives you guys recommend?) I'd like to have my audio split two ways. 
1. Spotify Audio coming through my Bluetooth speakers
2. Call (Specifically Google Meet/Google Duo) audio coming through my also Bluetooth connected Galaxy Buds2 Pro
I have successfully gotten dual audio with buds2 pro and buds pro working, but ANY combination of buds + speaker does not work. My thought is that It just merges the audio so kind of identifies call audio as also media audio or i guess it can't split the call and media audio streams - It can only do two separate media streams and just attaches the call audio to one of them. An assumption based on my testing, but I assume it is correct(?)
Now, my ONLY goal here is just to split CALL audio from ANY phone call or video call and my media output - I want calls on one device and music on another. Is this possible in ANYWAY at all????"	N

Going caseless with this phone - Its a bad idea	I had this phone since the launch, and had been using a case on it. Everything seemed to be fine. My stupid brain then decided to try it caseless. Bad decision. Just a slight knock into something can cause the phone's frame to be chipped away, and the frame has so many nicks and scratches. This is not normal, as I've had other phones who had suffered worse and are in better condition, and I'm one with OCD. For others who deciding whether to use it caseless, Don't. Just Don't, or you'll probably regret it. I definitely recommend using a protective case. Really disappointed. Looking forward to trading it in for the S23 Ultra next year. I've learnt my lesson.	N

wtf battery....	"Just upgraded a few days ago from my s10+. I used smart switch and my battery burned up pretty fast but I assumed it was because I was loading so much across.
I'm used to getting a new phone and getting days off one charge. This thing is burning through battery faster than my s10+ to the point I haven't wiped that yet for trade in because this thing is not making me happy.
So far I've wiped the cache, turned off location, put apps to sleep, and a few other things I forget at this point.
Went to bed at 95% last night...woke up at 8:00 with 80%. 2 hours of SOT scrolling social media and I'm down to 51%.
I'm considering taking it into Verizon to see if there was a setting that transferred over causing this, but I am not happy. This things battery life might be worse than my 3 year old s10+. It's having to go on charge at least once a day and again at night before bed."	N

I took it to the Samsung Experience Store in my town. I tried calling them for two weeks because I live half an hour away and they left me on hold every time, for hours. The earliest appointment they had for me was a week away. I had to storm in there and speak with an annoyed tone for them to take it in that day. They promised the next day, it took them two. They replaced the motherboard when I insisted on getting a replacement.
&amp;#x200B;
SPOILER ALERT: it did nothing.
I'm tired of struggling with a phone I spent almost $1,000 on. I'm trying to find a way to get a refund or press legal charges on this asinine company. I'll take my money and go buy an iPhone 13 or a Google Pixel 7. My 8+ gave me no sort of issue similar to this and I regret taking it for granted. You guys are blessed for having working phones, but my phone is heavily linked to my job and I've missed too many calls/messages from my boss (to the point where I'm facing occupational probation) to let this go on any longer.

How much SOT do you usually get on your Galaxy s22	I already have the s22 and the battery life is kinda average. I use it for scrolling on tiktok, watching YouTube, playing games etc. and if i‚Äôm lucky i get 4 hours of SOT before i need to charge again. I‚Äôm completely fine with that and i thought it would be kinda fun to hear how much SOT you guys get	N

Help needed with fast charging	"I'm not sure if this post will even go through since my acc is new but I have bug with the two different options of fast charging.
In the Device Care menu there is a ""Fast Charging"" toggle and a ""Super Fast Charging"" one. 
During the first few days since I bought the phone, both of them worked as expected, Fast Charging showed the notification that Fast Charge was active and the Super one did the same respectively. 
But now only the Super Fast Charging works and the ""regular"" fast charging just says it's going at the slow rate, I even timed it just now to make sure.
What gives?
Edit: So it seems like this phone charges at 1700 mA according to an app called Ampere regardless if the fast charging toggle is on or off. Only Super Fast toggle makes a difference and boosts it to 4000 mA. Which is weird because I could've sworn it was different when I first bought it but oh well ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
Edit 2: for the sake of figuring it out I went and bought a cable that I could use with my old 5W iPhone charger and now it seems to be slow charging, which isn't surprising because it has a low wattage, but that confirms it's not a visual bug. The time remaining is about 2 hours, similar to what it was when the Fast Charging toggle was still working with the official Samsung one."	N

Tip for screen protectors	"I've used two now, thr expensive Zagg, glass like film, really strange and squishy. Bought for ¬£25 (‚Ç¨32), so I liked it to start, few bubbles and lines dissappear after a day of having it installed. Sounds good, except, as soon as I use the S Pen, it marks! Every single little marks on this screen protector! It's horrible, when you have a clean screen, it shows up everything and makes the device look cheap! Upon recent traveling, this expensive one breaks.
By this, I mean that it peels, it has bubbles around the edge that spread, it gets dust under the screen, it becomes useless! Maybe the heat did it? Not sure but never had this issue before. 
So I bought the original film one from Samsung. And can I just say that, anyone new to the phone, anyone needing a new screen thing, or is in the market for one. Scrap the zagg one, scrap the ¬£30 (‚Ç¨45) Whitestone dome. Get the Samsung original one! It is amazing, cannot even tell its on my screen, doesn't mark compared to the zagg, feels like brand new glass and works with every case. I use Samsung leather case, but have spigen and a couple others and works with all !!!!!"	N

Is it worth upgrading my s22 to a plus or ultra for the battery? Realistically how much additional screen on time is there between the 3 models?	"I currently have the s22 Snapdragon model (I'm in Canada). I would say I'm a medium - medium high user. I don't game, but I use my phone for social media, maps, and when I'm the office lots of YouTube/Spotify/podcast. 
I'm averaging 5-7 hours of SOT. I've had my s22 for a week, and I have another week to decide if I want to switch to the plus or ultra. With my government plan options, I pay $5 a month for the s22, but I would get the 22plus for $12 a month and the ultra for $17 a month, so cost is not really a big factor. 
My main issue is battery life. During work/office I can charge my phone, but when I'm out for a full day/traveling, I use my phone a lot for maps/browsing etc. Chose the s22 because I wanted a compact phone (coming from a pixel 3xl). I have a pretty active lifestyle, I go rock climbing/paddleboarding etc and use my phone to take photos/videos (I have a phone lanyard for everything).
However, I am wondering how much extra battery life I would get if I upgraded to one of the other models. I did a few test on my phone, got to my office at 9am, stayed on lte, watched a few hours of YouTube downloads/podcast with screen off and it lasted to roughly 6pm. I think on this day I got 6.5 hours of SOT. Would love a phone that last from when I wake up to when I sleep. 
The battery seems to be quite a big step up from the s22 to the plus. I'm guessing the plus is about the same as my pixel 3xl so I'm leaning towards that if I do upgrade. The pixel 3xl is probably as big as I wojld want a phone. The battery life seems incremental from the plus to the ultra and I think the ultra would be too big. Thoughts on size as well, do the phones actually feel significantly bigger from one another (3 xl vs s22 plus vs ultra) I always have a thin case on of that makes a difference!"	N

How to correctly restore with new upgrade	Upgrading from a S20 to a S22, haven't turned it on yet as I want to be sure to transfer my information correctly. I have used smart switch before but when reading directions for the S22 as it walked thru each step I wondered how I do this without duplicating information, etc. There was a step that essentially said to click either yes or no to have google transfer your information (contacts, apps, data, messages, etc.). Should I click yes for that and then use smart switch after? Will it duplicate? I use vzw message+ for texting and want to be sure all my messages come over on to the new phone. I know photos and apps and such will show up once I sign into my google account. I thought I read somewhere that mms may not come over with smart switch which concerns me and makes me think maybe I should click yes when it asks to have google bring everything over? Just not sure and probably overthinking but seriously want to make sure I do things right and not end up with double messages and stuff like that. Hope I'm making sense!	N

[Mod post] Samsung has had a data breach. See below for more information.	"Hi everyone, 
As the title says Samsung has officially stated they have recently had a data breach sometime in late july and have figured out what data has been breached. 
[Relevant article](https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-us-data-breach/)  
Credit to u/Sunsetisbad1000 for bringing this to our attention.   
Samsung has stated it will reach out to you directly to inform you if your data has been breached and what information has been compromised. Reports are saying not all customers have been affected and breaches range from names all the way to sensitive information like social security numbers.   
Samsung warns against clicking unfamiliar links and attachments (as always) to prevent this from happening on a larger scale. Always remember, the weakest link of security is always the end-user.

Settings that improve battery life for many!	"I've seen many complaints about bad battery life, I've already posted these steps on various posts in the comment section. I myself didn't have any battery issues even without going through these steps but still these settings improved my battery life, I went from 6:30/7 hours SOT (light to mid usage) to 8/9 hours of SOT. In my case, typical battery drainage on standby (wifi, mobile data, bluetooth off) was 3% per hour, after these settings it's about 1% per hour. Try these settings and let me know if it helped you, good luck!
1. Go into developer options and enable ""Suspend execution for cached apps"" 
2. Disable Adaptive battery option.
3. Put apps that you don't need to work in background in deep sleep.
4. Put your phone's processing speed to High instead of Optimized, High provides better performance, fixes lag issues and actually increases the battery life for some reason. 
5. Disable Adaptive brightness
6. Disable WIFI scanning and Bluetooth scanning. 
7. Clear your cache by going in to recovery mode, search on YouTube ""S22 Ultra how to clear cache"" and keep in mind that your phone has to be completely turned off while it is connected to a PC via cable. 
And after those steps your battery's gonna significantly improve.
Edit: Poor mobile network signal strength actually is one of the biggest causes of battery drain, even if you are seeing a full signal in status bar it doesn't mean that you actually have a great signal, to actually check your signal strength type in the settings search bar the following ""SIM card status"" or go to About phone, status information and sim card status, there you can see your signal strength measured in dBm. 
50-70 dBm is considered as great signal, minimal battery drain
70-90 dBm is considered as acceptable signal, medium battery drain
90-120 dBm is considered as horrific signal, high battery drain 
So when dBm value is high that means that your phone is consuming more power so it can give you a stable connection."	N
best, and easiest, screen protector for the 22 ultra?	I tried to install one of the zagg ones. Was a solutely shit	N
a fond(ish) goodbye	"Long time lurker, first - and last - time poster.
I received my S22U (Ex. 256) about a week before UK release and it blew my mind. The speed, the capabilities, even the camera felt like a cheat code. I joined this sub almost immediately so I could share the joy of others receiving their devices and just living life with it, sharing tips, and discussing the best parts of the phone and how to make use of them. And for a while that's what I got.
Time went on.
Not even a year since release and the sub has descended into some kind of competition about who can get the shittest SoC or whose phone lags the most. It's a fucking drag, and has got me second guessing everything I loved about this phone to begin with. I caught myself investigating a trade-in for a 13PM today and that's what got me thinking, ""do I actually want to trade my phone, or has what I've been reading made me think I do?"".
I came to the realisation that the only negativity I feel towards my device is a direct result of reading posts in this sub, constantly finding myself comparing my stats with strangers, and for what reason? 
And so with that, and with sincere thanks for the early days of tips and tricks and the treasure trove of advise that helped get me up and running at the start, I leave you to live a life in blissful ignorance of everyone else's problems.

SOT discrepancy	"I use Tasker to read system logs
dumpsys batterystats --charged | grep -m1 'Screen on: '
Which shows me 4 hours SOT.  Looking at device battery stats only see 2 hours SOT.  
Wondering which is most accurate and if anyone else can compare their results? If system logs more accurate, then people are complaining about SOT that is based on bad information."	N

Wireless powershare while wired charging?	"I can't fully remember, but I think I used to be able to charge my earbuds while the phone was charging.
It is currently not supported, but older forum posts say that it is possible.
Did Samsung take away this feature with a recent update?
Can someone with an older firmware version confirm or deny this?
EDIT: Ok I got it working. As it turns out you need the original 45W super fast charger AND toggle ""Super fast charging"" ON. Then, it allows simultaneous wired charging and wireless power sharing."	N
S22 Ultra Exynos version benchmark results	Hey, I got these results running benchmarks on geekbench and antutu, what are your results? I ran the tests only once and got those results.	N
The Ring to rule them All?	Has any tried the Spigen OneTap Ring adapter on their S22Ultra?	N
refresh rate bug	I have noticed that if I disable adaptive brightness the phone will lower the refresh rate to as low as 24hz (confirmed by enabling the show refresh rate in developer options), when adaptive brightness is disabled it will not go below 120hz, I wonder how much of a negative effect this has on battery life, the problem with not having adaptive brightness is that it isn't as visible in direct sunlight as it won't let the brightness go as high, anyone else got this problem, 3 S22 ultras (all exynos) on August update have this issue, not sure if this has always been an issue but just noticed it the other day when messing with developer options	N
Tried this metal frame "Case" for the S22 Ultra.		N
Dropped my S22 Ultra for the first time, but had a case on it.	"Hey you all!  
I sadly dropped my phone onto our normal living floor hoping this was never going to happen.  
But I guess the chance of dropping it just consistently raise with usage.  
The official Samsung Leather Case protects my phone.  
It fell on its back from approx. 30 cm (12 inches) and I think the slight edge on the case protected the lenses from direct impact.  
I dont see any scratches, shattering or breakings as of right now.  
What I was wondering about is the internal components. Can they get damaged by the phone being dropped? If so whats actually happening then?  
How would you notice inner components being damaged - by less processing power of the phone?  
Has someone of you managed to never drop their phone for a year straight?  
I was so protective but today it slipped out of my lap.  
Lesson learned and I am going to step up my protection.  
If there is one thing I hate, than its dropping my phone.  
Do you agree, that dropping your phone is just part of the process of owning one?  
I legit never made it to not drop a phone until I switched it out for a newer one."	N
Firmware changing(UAE to USA)	"I have s22 ultra UAE version-Snapdragon 8 gen 1
Can i change firmware with USA region without root(odin flash) and without any problem?"	N
How do the battery levels work?	"I notice that alot of my samsung devices have weird battery behavior(not in a bad way). Maybe this how all phones and tablets are, i wouldn't know.  
On one of my tablets the 90-100% takes twice as long to drain than the 80-90%.  
Or on my s22 ultra, 85 to80 percent lasts half hour of use but 80 to 75 percent can last a whole hour doing the exact same tasks.  
This isn't a one off incident. Its happens basically every single time.  
Whats the science behind this behavior? Is it normal among all lithium battery devices?"	N
Found a definitive solution to fix animation stutter on minimizing to home screen	I am using S22 Ultra since April this year and finally found the solution to animation stuttering on the home screen minimizing. All I did was remove all the widgets that I had on home screen and it has never stuttered so far for the last 8 days. I also got my phone reset from the service center as I upgraded to One UI 5 Beta and couldn't downgrade to One UI 4 stable by myself. After that, I have seen no stuttering at all. I don't know why? Maybe widgets are not that well optimized?	N
Finally replaced my broken screen! Way easier than I thought, only took an hour.		N
Update on botched repair	Apart from the repair shop messing up the front camera and deleting apps without my knowledge, I also noticed that Antutu is showing highly inaccurate readings in CPU temperature. For instance, I was just playing Genshin to test the screen and stuff and noticed that battery temperature is accurate at around 37-39 C¬∞, but CPU was almost at 80 degrees! Before it showed at a max of 51-56 C¬∞ and now it's showing way higher. I also tried AIDA64 and the same. Did they somehow mess up that as well? I will come back in a few days and confront them about it while I keep testing out my phone.	N

Apple to Samsung	"Hello! I am preparing to make a full swap from the iPhone 13, Apple Watch 7 and iPad Pro m1 to S22u and whatever the watch and tablet equivalents are. I‚Äôve had iPhones for the past decade-ish and I‚Äôm just bored. I crave freedom to do things Apple won‚Äôt let me like move apps where I want and iCloud keeps giving me error codes.

iPhone to S22U Whatsapp Message Transfer?	"Most of the YT videos I see say that the iPhone to Android whatsapp transfer works only on newly set-up Android phone.

"Delete Old Messages" option missing in settings	"Hey everyone! I've been trying in vain to find the ""delete old messages"" option in my phone. Can anyone tell me where it is? Has that feature been removed? All I can find in searches is the

Did resetting the phone or reflashing it improve battery life dor you?

Update broke my data connection.....	I am using Exynos 256 gig version. So 2 days ago I got an update and installed it immediately, after i restarted the phone not long has passed and I noticed an issue, My data is broken, it works for a couple of seconds and than it just breaks, my signal strenght is good, never had issues before. An example, I am scrolling trough tiktok and all of the sudden video or comments wont load up at all, after a couple of seconds it starts working fine again , and after a couple more seconds it breaks again and same thing happens over and over. I did a factory data reset, wiped my cache but it doesnt help. Not sure if this means anything but I noticed when it happens on the little icon showing the signal, arrow going away from the phone is white and arrow going in the phone is blacked out as if its not reciving data I assume. I know its not my internet provider because I took the sim out and put it in my S9 and it works perfectly, going to be using s9 until I figure out what this is. Never had this issue before. And I know if I take it to the shop its going to take quite some time until they figure out what it is and if its even fixable, stuff like this is making me consider switching over to an iphone even tho I really like this device.	N
Repair Shop Fucked up my camera	I went to replace the front screen because it was pretty damaged and the place is highly rated and is certified by Samsung. So, of course, I trusted them. I waited and then they brought my phone and it of course looked very nice because obviously it was repaired. Tested everything and everything worked fine. Fingerprint worked fine too, surprisingly. Well, I went to test the cameras and back cameras all worked well. Moved to front camera and noticed that it doesn't focus anymore. No matter how much I try to focus, it's just a blurry mess. If I am far from the camera, the camera seems to work fine, but when I get closer, nothing focuses. I had pictures of me from before the repair and camera worked amazing, but I tested it and you can't even see the moles in my face. Also, the assholes uninstalled Antutu Benchmark and Accubattery, which I'm pretty sure they can't do due to privacy reasons. Anyways, what do you guys think I should do? Also, if anyone wonders, I can post pictures of before and after so you can clearly see.	N
This battery is absolute trash unfortunately.	5g drains this phone like crazy, 4g would give me maybe 2 hours sot more. So it's still trash. Can someone relate?	N

Proximity sensor bug	"I have an S22 ultra exynos.  After the latest avh9 update, the proximity sensor broke.  When making a phone call, the screen turns off immediately, and it only switches back on by pressing the power button.  
What I tried: 
I tested it in the Samsung members app and with other sensor test apps, and it didn't show any problems.  
I restarted the phone, it worked normally for a while, then this problem came up again. 
I turned off the double tap wake up, that didn't help either.  
I reset the phone, the problem remained.  
Has anyone experienced something similar or know of a solution?  
Sorry, English is not my native language."	N
Adaptive Power Saving is retarded	"So I've noticed something that would also occur on my S20+ (both Exynos) with APS turned on. It says it applies power saving dependant on your usage, but I will often have it turn on randomly when my phone's on 80%. 
I'd like to keep it on because I often forget to turn on power saving when my phone gets low, but I can't stand having to deal with 60hz at full battery."	N

YouTube don't auto rotate anymore.	"Previously if ""auto rotate'' on the phone were turned off, u were able to choose on witch side u want to watch video, just press Fullscreen and tilt on the side u want, now it is not possible anymore and that's extremely annoying...

How do I make pop-up notifications stay longer on a locked screen?	"By default, when I receive a text and the phone screen is locked the pop-up appears for only 4 sec.

Any tips on how to make pop-up notifications stay longer on a locked screen or screensaver?

S22P battery life easy hax?	"Broke my 13pro max. Got this phone for 300$ via Google Fi promo a while back. I haven't used android device as my Primo since 2017. Bought this as a stop gap solution till the new i14 launches and I didn't want to buy 13 pro max again for last 2 months. 
People collectively agree the battery is absolute trash. Is there any way I can do to improve the battery or is it a lost cause at this point? I never had to look up battery improvement guides till recently with this phone? Every dang guide on XDA, android blogs or this sub includes disabling shit. Disable this disable that. Bruh what? Ok so my facetious rant aside. I really want to know is there anything that I'm doing wrong, that can help me improve the battery? I set it up as new android and did not move stuff from my iPhone. I had around 60 apps on my prev vs ~30 on this. I have 7 exchange emails that I do need on push. I need GPS, Bluetooth and NFC on 24/7 for work reasons.

Best Buy CRAZY Trade in deal! Practically free phone upgrade S21U to S22U	"Good day all, just wanted to share some knowledge.
Today I went to my local best buy here in Maryland and traded in my S21 Ultra 256GB (Verizon model, phantom black, paid off) for a New S22 Ultra(Unlocked) 128GB. The S22 Ultra was $899+tax, trade-in promo gave me $900. Ended up paying $29.99 OTD today, I owe Verizon $35 for the activation fee, and in total, I'm in the hole $65 total for the latest S Series device.
I got lucky a month ago and got FiOS internet so I got a $50 Verizon gift card too. So $15 bucks in the hole technically for a brand new phone. Talk about a deal... Plan to trade for S23 Ultra though, loving the new device! I didn't need the space thankfully so 128GB works!"	N

Samsung galaxy S22 ultra!	"For a long time I had a question is it worth getting Samsung S22 Ultra?
The Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra is easily the most powerful and versatile Android phone wich I ever used . This is the best display I've tested in a phone, and Samsung's cameras are much improved, especially in low light. Plus, the powerful zoom continues to be hard to beat.
&amp;#x200B;

Should I keep my s22u?	"I'm a big photo and video guy, and I thought that the convenience of seeing yourself while filming on the zflip 4 would be a selling point... but I'm not sure if I want to get rid of my really good s22u cameras.
I'm also let down that the zflip4 doesn't have a 512 GB option.
I really do like that compact design though and the custom front screen options.. Should I do it?
Edit: I am in the US. thanks y'all, I've got a lot to consider! I'm gonna peek into trading with Samsung and whatnot, but it sounds like for now my s22u might be the better choice for the moment."	N

Unlocked Samsung S22+ on Verizon	Looking to grab a deal at BestBuy on an Unlocked S22+. I understand the advantages of unlocked phones, but never personally have used one on Verizon. I understand some specific software like Verizon Call Filter, Verizon Cloud, etc, won't work (no loss for me). However, will other features like video calling, Wi-Fi calling, RCS messaging (I think that goes thru Google anyways) work? How about C-Band and UWB? Does the unlocked version have all the necessary bands needed to act exactly like the carrier version of the S22+? Thanks	N

Got the equipment credit deal for the S22 Ultra, what happens if I get another phone instead?	"I got the $1000 upgrade promo for the S22 Ultra. You basically trade your device in, paid the down payment and Tmobile would give you a $1000 off the phone that you wanted. I got the S22 Ultra. 
The problem now is that I have buyer's remorse for the S22 Ultra. There is nothing wrong with the phone, has no scratches, but its too big for me and I just don't like the box like feeling of the phone, nor the curved edges. I really want to get the S22 plus with its flat screen. What will happen if I buy that phone? I know you have to sign paperwork for the upgrade, and they are giving me an equipment credit for the S22 Ultra for the next 24 months..does this mean that it will stop if I change phones? I don't want to be stuck paying for a phone that I don't want. 
No idea how this works, if someone could give me advice, i would appreciate it."	N

\* When I have multiple service lines (one via regular SIM, one via eSIM), I can not configure which SIM to use for calls and which one for data. It's all or nothing. Either use one for all, or another.
\* I don't even have an option to enable/disable VoLTE, which all carrier branded phones have!!!

s pen tips for aliexpress arrived, here's how it went...	"Hi guys 
I ordered some s pen tips from aliexpreee that said they were maid for s22 ultra s pen, they arrived quick enough but there was a problem, the stem of the pen ( the long stick u ter the nib), it was very thin, thinner that the original. The tip rocked around as I wrote with it. The tip itself was good enough and writing felt awsome but the damn stem was thinner then it should have been.
I replaced the ali express one back with my original tip, pressure sensitivity and everything works as expected so the tips are definitely replaceable, the only thing is we have to find tips that accually fit.

I usually don't leave reviews on things not to buy but if you are in the market for a screen protector and you're looking at Zagg, don't do it.	"Title says it all.  I've used zagg in the past on my note 9 and 10 and I was pretty happy, it was nice paying ten bucks to have them install it when one would get damaged.  Fast forward to this device and that thing is over priced trash akin something I would expect to find a three pack of on Wish or AliExpress.
The coverage is decent, and if you are somewhere that sells it natively, you can find a zagg shop to install it. It also has a lifetime warranty that will allow them to replace it for 10 bucks if you show up with the old one. That's where the pros end. 
I'm not rough on my devices, I just use it as a phone should be used.  I keep low profile cases that have a lip so it can be face down and I'm some what cautious to where I sat it anyways. 
But this thing scratches so easily. Compared to the Samsung one, white stone, etc etc, it's clarity isn't the best.  This becomes compounded with the ease in which it will gather scratches, smudges and fingerprints.  It's a finger print magnet.  
Do save your 65 bucks (for one protector) and explore literally anything else (except for the cheap edge adhesive ones and the ones with a fingerprint hole)."	N

I keep watching camera comparisons on youtube and i realised that my phone can't pull as good photos as these on youtube...
I love taking pics on [FULL MODE] and sometimes 9:16 but only when i take photos for social media. Is there something i am missing, like i take really good photos but the quality is bad or my expectations too high.
Also when taking photos in dark places everything is blurry if i  don't hold it as stable as i can...
Do you have any recommendations which can help me?
Thank you!"	N
Video Stabilization	I had video stabilization on while recording some videos, unaware of the cropping that it does once finished recording. I had everything I wanted in frame, but because of the cropping, am missing some of the video I really needed in the first place. Is there a way, since initially it was in frame, to somehow retrieve the parts of the video that was cropped out?	N
Tapping noises when making phone calls	Everytime I dial a number that isn't a mobile phone, (e.g doctor or department store) I hear a constant tapping noise while the phone is ringing, and then again when the person on the other end is speaking. Has anyone experienced this too or is there something wrong with my hardware?	N

Transfer Large Amount of Files to S22 Ultra Internal Storage	"Trying to find a way to transfer \~90GB of music files from my PC to the S22 Ultra.  No matter what combination of drives and cables I try the process quits a few seconds into copying.  It starts long enough to display the ""Copying Files"" window with an estimated time to complete (nearly 3 hours) but then just abruptly quits.
Any suggestions?"	N

I am a little bit worried about my new phone	"Hello everyone! Well, my new S22 Ultra just arrived and I was very anxious to get it started with it. So, I took the little pin to remove the sim card and removed it from my old one (Note 10+). The sim door from the Note 10+  is up in the phone. Then, I tried to open the sim door from the S22 Ultra, using the upper hole, but the sim door in S22 Ultra is down ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Well, I forced the pin in a wrong hole of the phone. Now I am afraid something bad was caused. I believe the team who build the phone thought someone could make it and they made something to prevent damage, but I would be much better if I was sure of it. Anyone have some words to calm me down? Thanks in advance!"	N
This may sound like a stupid question	"Can Verizon lock my Samsung factory unlocked S22 Ultra?
I ask because I was messing around with some of my apps today and they just aren't working like they should. My Samsung spam blocker isn't working correctly.  None of the dialer codes will work ie: \*#06# t0 check your IMEI and SIM card, \*#0\*# for Test Mode, \*#0228# to check battery status, \*#0808# for USB settings, just to name a few.
&amp;#x200B;
When I checked my software service provider version, it ended in VZW/VZW,XAA/XAA and I'm still running 4.1 Android 12

WiFi Connection Speed Fluctuation	"Hi everyone, 
I have a S908E version (Snapdragon) with 2. August patch (AVH9) on TUR CSC. Everything is fine and phone works really nicely. Yet, today I noticed some weird behavior with wifi connection speed. I haven't noticed that since today, because I was staying on our sea side house and connection wasn't as good (50Mbps down, 8Mbps up) but I had wifi 6 router there (xiaomi ax1800) and my phone connects at 1Gbps speed, so I didn't care and notice anything.
Yesterday I came to home and here I have 1Gbps symetrical fiber connection with Zyxel T50B modem (wifi 5). My phone drops as low as 6Mbps in connection speed with the modem and whenever I use wifi it increases but still not reaches max 866Mbps speed. When it reconnects to wifi, it shows 866Mbps for a second and drops to lower speeds. Every other device (except my dad's A33 5G it also connects at slow speeds) hits 866Mbps on 5GHz and stays there unless at edge of the house."	N
Think I chose poorly	Well, I bought one on Aug 22. Really want to like it but don't. Miss my old Note 4. At least it worked. This doesn't. Watched many videos. Most of them don't look like my phone. Less of them tell me the right steps to follow to make my phone behave like the one in the video. Chrome's folder for the phone has more sites in the "Doesn't work" folder than in the folders that tell me what to remember to do. I'm sure a lot of it is me - had the Note 4 for the past 6 years. I didn't "grow up with the technology" like everybody else. "Always on" never is. "Stays on" if you look at it doesn't. Tried teaching Google Assistant and nothing happened. Camera might not be any sharper than the Note 4 was. Please convince me I'm wrong and point me toward some good videos for a beginner. I especially was interested in the camera - won a town contest once, would love to do more with that. All I do is mainly google search to figure out how to do things because YouTube assumes I already know how to do everything and can immediately find the settings and I don't. Who should I watch for some good introductions?	N
Phone now out of Warranty with Samsung	"Hello everyone, so recently i broke the screen on my s22 ultra, upon looking at the damage when it hit concrete there was a hole in the screen it may off hit a rock as it landed. 
I got it repaired by a local phone shop that had genuine Samsung parts they quoted me the same price as Samsung does for screen repairs, so i went with them as the nearest Samsung repair store was in westfield stratford, london. My phone is phantom black the only screens or bezels they had was silver.
They repaired my phone with the silver frame and i got home and front facing camera wasn't working (it was working before and after the phone screen broke) they said they didn't have the front facing camera at no point during the repair did they tell me they didn't have black bezels in stock or about the camera not working. So i bombarded them asking when will they have the part, they eventually got it and they tested it but it doesn't work with the phone they said it could be a connector issue.
I rung samsung repair centre and they have quoted and booked me a repair of ¬£309 but could be more as it is obviously out of warranty now but my question is, is it possible to be back in warranty after the repairs are done. I will not be using that shop or any repairs unless authorised ever again

Latest Baseband Version for locked S22 Ultra (S908U)	"AT&amp;T-locked Galaxy S22 Ultra users, which baseband version do you have if you go to Settings -&gt; About Phone -&gt; Software information?
Just checked for software updates and after checking I am still told ""Current software is up to date"" but have baseband version S908USQU2AVF7 with a kernel build date of Mon Jun 20 20:46:04 2022. 
I chatted with AT&amp;T and they are saying this is the latest version for the S22 Ultra and they are not seeing anything newer on their end. However, my wife's AT&amp;T-locked S22 Plus (S906U) has received August and September updates and is now on AVH baseband. 
I haven't ever had an easy time with updates on this S22 Ultra. In the spring I had to set the date forward a couple weeks to get an update to download, I think it was the April update. Then I got no further updates until July (the update I am on) when I took out my SIM card and put it in an old phone, used that phone for 30 minutes, then put the SIM back in the S22 Ultra. After doing that, it checked for updates and downloaded the June and July updates in succession.
However, despite trying that trick again a couple times since (after my wife's S22 Plus got the August and now September updates) no further updates have been offered to my S22 Ultra. AT&amp;T has confirmed they have the right IMEI (and eSIM IMEI as well as I have a second line) on file."	N

How is the battery on the Samsung S22 Snapdragon?	I am looking for an Android phone that isn't the size of a phablet, and the 6.1" compact size intrigues me. I will be running Android Auto on it a lot, and I do not game. Is the battery life that bad?	N
S22...fold?	After a few days with my S22 I'm realized I'm REALLY enjoying the feel of it compared to my S22 U and Fold3. Then I remembered the fold3 and the s22 have the same screen size just different dimensions and it made me Start to think about how much more comfortable it would be if my fold had the form factor of my s22 when closed, but unfolded in an already landscape mode that I constantly am using on my fold 3. I never really use the fold unfolded in portrait more, I like to use it as a tablet like my tab S8+. I know that's more like the oppo find n but I think it would be super cool form factor if they took the fold in the direction of shorter and wider to make the outer screen more usable.	N
Is the S22 Ultra still worth it?	"I am in a situation where I might get to upgrade my work provided phone soon when we get a new hire in our department. I am using an S21+ now and I had always loved my Notes when I had them. I know everyone will say wait for the S23 it's right around the corner but I might not have that luxury. The main reason I will get to upgrade is because we are looking to hire someone new and I would upgrade my phone and pass mine down. I have thought about the Pixel as well but the modem/signal issues turn me away. Maybe the 7 will be announced before I get the chance to upgrade. But I have seen so many mixed feelings about the S22 Ultra and that it has been a disappointing device in terms of battery and such.  
Just curious what people thought on the S22 Ultra 7 months after release."	N
Apple announcement	I know people tend to bring up this topic every year (not really me) because I could careless, but I will give it to them this year.

Not only did they make the hole cut out appealing on the iPhone they also made it functional. Just curious what you guys think. I'm over here a little jealous of the feature wishing that someone develops a 3rd party app for it on Android. Apple really surprised me with that and I'm hardly ever surprised by Apple lol. Curious what you guys think?	N
is s22 ultra worth it?	"Hello S22Ultra reddit,
I have been waiting for my next phone and when I saw S22 ultra is about to get out I was so excited.

Battery life?	I've recently purchased S22 Ultra (sd version) almost 10 days back and it's an amazing phone to use, BUT, I've been facing battery issues. My last 8/10 days have been spent on watching YouTube vids on how to get that extra juice, and still I'm probably getting not more than 5 hrs of screen on time.

Repair Tech View on S22 Ultra	"I work as a repair tech directly partnered with Asurion, so we're Samsung Authorized. I've also been a die hard Samsung user since 2009. I have to say, honestly? They've been disappointing me lately. The S22U has so many problems, and that's not just coming from being a repair tech. Of course I see all the issues, etc. But in comparison to every other line up we have had? I get to see where Samsung has cut corners on this phone. And the cherry on top is that the software built into Android for the phone doesn't even do the cameras justice. You have to find a 3rd party app to make sure your raw photos and videos are even remotely close to what they tout for the performance and resolution. This may be the first time I'm considering going to IP... I know, blasphemous.

S22 Ultra and Galaxy Tab S8+ or the Fold4?	Hey guys! So I'm having a hard time deciding, I have a Galaxy Tab s8+ and an S22 Ultra that I recently got with new lines and was wondering if I should keep them both, or return them and just get a Fold4?

Anyone else disappointed in the S22?	I had the s10 until recently, and the screen stopped working and I really needed a phone, so I quickly grabbed the new s22 (regular). The design is so so nice, but other than that, it honestly feels identical other than the 120hz, and even like a downgrade in some ways. The battery is worse, the resolution is technically lower, the camera app is laggier and hardly better quality, no headphone jack, vibration motor is extremely soft, the speakers are literally quieter and worse quality, and apps don't really run THAT much faster. And it didn't even come with the new super fast charger. I honestly feel like should've just bought another unused s10 and used that for another year or two, as it still felt futuristic, fast, smooth, and super nice to use even over 3.5 years after release	N
Galaxy S22+ Low Battery % Accuracy	"Are there any S22+ users that have noticed wonky battery percentage below 10%?

I'm looking for anyone who has used both the Fold4 and S22U for opinions on battery life between the two, I don't necessarily need the big screen the Fold4 offers, although it is nice,just a battery that will get me through the day without needing to charge up midway through my work day."	N
Lock screen question	"Hi,
I have recently upgraded to a Galaxy s22 plus from an S20 and would like to glean the wealth of knowledge on this forum. 
When I missed a call or message on the S20 it displayed the caller's contact name on the lock screen, but I cannot work out how to do this on the S22 plus. I have looked for some time on Google, but cannot find the answer for this issue. 
I may have enabled the setting in the 3rd party app, 'Good lock' or similar program, but I cannot remember how Ii did it 
It is probably extremely simple for the knowledgable people on this forum, so I would really appreciate your advise & help if possible. 
Thankyou very much in advance, 
Simon"	N
Samsung camera app missing filters?	"Hi, 
I upgraded my phone and noticed that the Samsung camera app on s22 doesn't have some face filters like nose reshaping and eyebrow shaping.  
It only has jaw and eye size along with smooth.  
I checked the net and it seems that the current filters are the only ones that have been there on all versions of the app.  
I'm wondering now if I had a modded version of Samsung camera app that included those extra face filters!?  
Anyone know what's going on... Is there a version with nose shape filter? Is it a modded version I had?  
I've checked all the third party camera apps and none resemble the Samsung native app so can't be them. 
Am I just going mad...!!?  
Any help locating this version would be great!"	N

New to S22 Ultra - from a long time Pixel customer	"I will keep this short and sweet. I have had every Google Pixel since Pixel 2 through 6 Pro. Before Pixels, I was on iPhone, and Before that a Samsung s5. 
Wow. This device exceeds all my expectations. Fantastic. No lag, great SOT battery,  great features,  just smooth as silk. What a premium experience. 
I am really glad I made the switch."	N
Just Return The Thing	"I have never in my life seen so many people crying about things that are wrong with this phone. I swear, there should be a waiting period for people who want to buy a smartphone, one that includes becoming familiar with it before getting it. It is clear that the phone has a few minor issues, but most problems are so trivial and childish that at times, it is a 12 yr old that's posting it. 
Let me make this clear so that I am not misunderstood. 
If you bought this phone sight unseen without doing at least the simplest research on it, that's your fault.
If you bought this phone expecting the pictures will turn out with DSLR quality, that's your fault.
If you bought this phone expecting it to like whatever phone you had before, that's your fault.
If you have the Beta version, and some things are not behaving as they did, but you think it's a problem, that's your fault.
Don't even het me started on people comparing the S22 Ultra to the S23 and S24...Phones that haven't even been officially announced yet. That is about the most stupid thing I've seen yet, trying to decide if they should keep their phone or buy a phone that's still nothing but rumors and conjectures. 
Seriously, some of you sound like little children, whining and throwing tantrums because their phone does or does not do this or that. And most of the time, I ignore them like I do a child. But it is becoming annoying to see these things multiple times a day.
So my advice is simple. If you don't like the way the phone is acting, just return it. TracPhones are still for sale, or Obama phones."	N

Dual Sim Data Auto Switching Experience?	Hey all, I am just wondering if any of you use dual sim auto data switching, and if so how well does it work for you?

The easiest in terms of not adding a bunch of equipment to the vehicle would be just to get a second sim if the dual auto switching feature works well. Somehow though I worry it would require a complete loss of signal though, or else be fairly slow to detect poor throughput and switch over. Which would defeat my whole purpose. I wish there was a better solution for aggregating both data plans. If you happen to have ideas, or experiences I would be very appreciative to hear your thoughts.	N

Any way to make sure my phone never predicts a certain word?	"I love how well the s22 adapts to my text patterns. It's great. It knows words I use frequently and I almost never have any typos, or fight against my phone's suggestions to say what I want. With that being said... IT WORKS TOO DAMN WELL!!!
This is a throwaway reddit account I use frequently. When I'm done, I completely log out of the account, and everytime I want to check it, I manually add the account back on to my phone. The problem is that because I type in the username for the account so frequently, that my phone makes it a priority to suggest it. It suggests it more than it suggests regular everyday words.
If I open a blank note and don't start typing right away, it's the first suggestion that pops up. I know you can tap and hold on a suggested word to forget that specific word, but for some reason, it won't let me forget my username. Ever. It's like my phone deems certain words as ""unforgettable"" based on frequency of use. That's great, but it's one word I actually WANT to type in manually 100% of the time, and never pop up in my suggestions.
The only temporary solution I've found, is to reset my personalized predictions when I know I'm not going to log into this account for a long time, but then it has to adapt to my regular speech patterns again, and after awhile it will pick up my username as a frequently used word and it won't let me forget it.
Any suggestions would be very helpful."	N

These tips allowed me to achieve 10h SoT instead of 4,5h on exynos	"Edit: I am really suprised of negative comments under this topic. I don't want to give advices for ppl which has 8h SoT and are happy for his phone stability. These advices are for ppl who are asking and posting on this reddit with their graphs about 3h SoT and really considering selling this phone and getting another one. You don't need to apply all these advices but I posted almost every trick that I found and can make ur battery better. You choose which one u apply and which one u don't. This post only purpose is to help ppl to get better SoT and its clearly saying that samsung did their job bad if ppl need that much dig into their phones to make their battery better.
&amp;#x200B;
Hello guys I gathered tips that might help u incrase ur SoT on s22ultra and other s22 galaxy phones. I improved my SoT a lot from 4,5h on average to almost 10h sot + 15h standby (exynos 8gb/128gb- on the screen 9h SoT + 20% battery so like ex. 11h SoT even ) ‚Äì in it: GPS always on, BT always on ‚Äì connected always to GW4, 90 mins BT music listening via galaxy buds 2 and 5h 3G, rest wi-fi, autoadaptive brightness on but adjusting it outside cuz max brightness is useless most of time. I applied methods that in my opnion don‚Äôt decrease posibilities of this phone because I want feel that this phone is flagship and decreasing everything will lead to that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to use everything that this phone can offer.
Sorry for my english but its not my native so probably there will be a lot typos and grammar mistakes.
I. Do factory reset and don‚Äôt use smartswitch option. This really worked for me. The graph I posted is second day after factory reset. It might be even better in next days. The reason is probably that if u had another company phones previously then smartswitch will copy much garbage from previous phones. I had oneplus, realme and xiaomi. I always copied previous phone and it seems it is mistake. Too much bloatware from previous phones, too much useless things that can affect our battery. I followed this one [https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/samsung-galaxy-optimization-guide-battery-performance-stability-heat.4376755/](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/samsung-galaxy-optimization-guide-battery-performance-stability-heat.4376755/) and did reset totally offline, without SIM. I recommend that to you.
II. System settings changes. Credits to u/SurturTheGod. I followed everything from this topic [https://www.reddit.com/r/S22Ultra/comments/x596pk/settings\_that\_improve\_battery\_life\_for\_many/](https://www.reddit.com/r/S22Ultra/comments/x596pk/settings_that_improve_battery_life_for_many/) expect auto brightness and I chose processing speed to optimized instead of high. Disabling  auto brightness will probably save u even more battery. Processing speed didn‚Äôt change anything for me I think. I also changed 4G/LTE to 3G cuz my 3G signal str was 70dbm while 4G/LTE was 110dbm. I have dl speed on 4G - 6mbps and 3G - 2mbps. This 2mbps is enough for my demands outside like web browsing, ytmusic, some utube, facebook, messenger etc. I always can change 3G to 5G or 4G if I want and I need higher internet speed.
III. Turn on dark mode permanently. It saves much battery on OLED screens. I like this mode much more than bright since 2 years I think. Imo it is just more healthy for eyes and its not disturbing ppl in ur bed (hi wives). I prefer it much more besides battery drain things.
IV. developer options: a) Suspend execution of Cached apps (under developer options): ENABLED b) Animation scale (3 entries) : x0.5 c) Bluetooth AVRCP Version: 1.6. Also Enable forcing apps to dark theme even if they don‚Äôt support it.
V. I use galaxy max hz and I really suggest u to do it. You cant get 4 day free trial and after that its lifetime around 4$. What it gives u? Well you can force adaptive refresh rate 10-120 hz and what is most important you can force adaptive refresh while save battery mode. I use it, because I really want adaptive refresh so I wouldn‚Äôt use power save mode if I cant use 120 hz. With this apk I can do it. You should pick up there things that are forcing lowest hz when screen off and also adapt hz to ur app cuz some apps don‚Äôt even allow u go over 60 so its useless to waste battery there. XDA site: [https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/app-galaxy-max-hz-refresh-rate-mods-screen-off-mods-qs-tiles-tasker-support-and-more.4181447/](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/app-galaxy-max-hz-refresh-rate-mods-screen-off-mods-qs-tiles-tasker-support-and-more.4181447/)
How to install it u will read here: [https://github.com/tribalfs/GalaxyMaxHzPub/wiki/How-to-grant-WRITE\_SECURE\_SETTINGS](https://github.com/tribalfs/GalaxyMaxHzPub/wiki/How-to-grant-WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS)
VI. I changed QWHD to FHD+. Tbh in blind test I don‚Äôt see any difference between these 2 resolutions (well to be hones my wife didn‚Äôt see any difference cuz for me it wasn‚Äôt blind test but I also didn‚Äôt see any differences).
VII. bloatware ‚Äì download ADB AppControl and follow this list of things to bloatware: : [https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/debloat-lists-s22-ultra-series.4413149/](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/debloat-lists-s22-ultra-series.4413149/) Important thing is if u for example use a lot facebook u should still delete it because its sending a lot infos about u what is bad and also it drains battery. I use a lot Facebook but I use it from internet browser. Also I switched web browser from chrome to internet samsung browser what I highly recommend for battery save. It‚Äôs forcing dark theme on sites perfectly, adblock can be downloaded also which works fine. Also Brave might be good if u don‚Äôt want samsung one. Chrome is most power consuming and I believe samsung browser is adjusted for samsung phones better than others.
VIII. If u do galaxy max hz step then u should use power save mode because u still can have 120 hz and u just lowering usage of ur GPU to 70%. I have this one turned on all time because why not. I don‚Äôt see any difference in how smooth phone works and its for sure better for battery.
IX. Bixby routines ‚Äì I use bixby routines more for lifespan than for battery saving. But I enabled these: if going to home (checked by location) turn off 3G and turn on WiFi, and also battery protection on till 45 mins before I have alarm on that means 85% -&gt; 100% will be charged like 15-20 mins before I wake up what is healthier imo for battery.
X. after all these steps do wipe cache - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7mrVWTa70](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7mrVWTa70) I also turned on three times a week my phone is restarting in night, I think it will be also good for battery lifespan.
After these steps my SoT increased from 4,5h sot on average to 10h sot (on screen it is 9h SoT with 20% battery left so its like 10-11h SoT). Some settings u can abandon  if u don‚Äôt want sacrifice some things. I did these steps and it worked. Almost every tip is copied from other ppl tips and gathered here. I tried to link every topic on xda or mentioned ppl like [u/SurturTheGod](https://www.reddit.com/user/SurturTheGod/) to let u know these ideas are not mine, I just gathered them.

Charger disconnnecting after washing phone	"Hello, 
I tried taking some underwater photos (sea) and afterwards washed phone with tap water. I don't do this often, in fact this is my first time.
My charger keeps disconneting since even though phone does not say it's wet or something.
Anypne with similar issues , and how did you resolve this, if you resolved it?
UPDATE: It seems that the issue  is resolved. After 2 or 3 days charger works ok. Hope it  stays that way. Not really sure what happened, maybe port dried im the meantime. However my best guess is that there were some sand or salt particles left. After I tried to make one more photo by submerging it in pool water I no longer have the charger problem. Perhaps pool water washed away any residue stuck in port. I'm not saying you should do the same.. Best course of action would be to very gently clean the port using something small, perhaps needle."

Cable Charging	Hi guys! I've a S22 ultra and I'm using the OEM charger and cable. I've turned off the superfast charging but fast charge and battery protect is on. I realized even though I'm using OEM charger, it says cable charging. Is it due to the battery protect feature?	N
Are type-c headphones safe to use?	I bought the official Samsung wired headphones for S22u because I don't want to use the wireless ones all the time, but I'm still worried about the headphones using the charging port. Will it affect charging? Will it ruin the charging port? I'm afraid that they might cause problems or conflicts with charing in the future. I have no idea how they work so so I was hoping someone might know better.	N

A weird looking device appears as s22..	Hi, so i was visiting my client (works in samsung) and i noticed there was a samsung s22 (by the looks of it) on the table. I approached it and i saw a sticker asking to not to take photos of the device. Also it had some codes engraved on the screen. I have NEVER seen such a device in my life!

Best refresh rate settings for streaming?	"Just picked up the Ultra, loving it, but it appears to have an issue with a bit of stuttering whilst streaming when in adaptive mode. This thread basically explains it all: https://eu.community.samsung.com/t5/galaxy-s22-series/s22-ultra-screen-refresh-rate-issue-jerky-videos/td-p/4880367
Now, I can use the standard mode to keep it at 60fps, but I know that generally most things stream at 24fps (what adaptive drops down to), so I'm not sure if this is an acceptable workaround.
I can use other other apps to keep it at 120fps, 24fps, or whatever, but this is hardly ideal, and keeping it at 120fps results in some of that horrible motion you see on some TVs from time to time.
I basically want to watch movies, etc. as authentically and as smoothly as possible, and it's a shame this doesn't seem to be very possible straight out of the box. What's the best solution? Switching to a static 24fps everytime I want to watch something? How does everyone else do it?"	N
Watch 5 pro gps accuracy vs my s22 (strava)	"I recently got the watch 5 pro and I have been waiting for gps accuracy reviews. There have been a few which mentioned decent gps accuracy but I wanted to test this out myself. I started a walk today morning, a short one, in my watch using the Samsung inbuilt walking profile and, in my phone, using Strava. I made sure that the gps signal was locked on in both devices before starting the walk. At the end of the walk, my watch recorded 1.16 mi and my phone recorded 1.24 mi. I was shocked to see a difference of 0.08 mi over such a short distance and decided to inspect the tracks very closely.
This surprised me even more because the gps signal from watch is more accurate, whereas my phone signal had some pretty bad spots in many areas. This makes me wonder, because I always imagined that my phone is way more accurate in terms of gps. Also does this mean that the Garmin's and Apple watches are more accurate than phones?"	N
Zflip 4 or the S22 ultra.	The flip 4 is cheaper but the reason a little worried about buying the ultra is durability. I think the flip 4 will be more durable.

Z Fold 4 or S22U + Tab S6 lite	"Hello people,
Like the title suggested, i need a tablet for notes taking (as a college student) and i am wondering if the Z Fold 4 tablet form factor will provide enough room and durability for me to take notes on the daily. 
Am i better off buying a tablet seperately for that purpose? I am afraid of tearing/damaging the tablet screen on the Z fold 4. Also battery ain't an issue since i carry a rechargeable power bank around.
Thanks.
Edit: Thnks to everyone who commented on this post. I have hence decided against buying the fold 4 since i fear i will damage the inner screen in no time + battery issue, etc."	N

Both were around the same price when on sale for me(I'm in Canada). I have heard that the s22u doesn't have great battery life and I don't mind but I do like the zflip 4 visually and conceptually my only issue is with its durability because I don't want to spend extra having to replace the screen protector often or screen because I do want a phone that's will last me 3+ years.

Swapping out my Fold 3 for S22 Ultra	"I've been thinking about switching out for a while and it came to fruition when I decided to swap out my mobile carrier as well. I've had the Fold 3 since launch and was super excited about the big screen.
While I loved the large display I found myself keeping it closed most of the time. I've never been nervous about a phone before but I keep thinking it's only a matter of time before the screen fails not if. The screen protector came off a few months ago yet I'm impressed because the inner display still does not have as much as a micro scratch on it
The front screen is too narrow and cramped. It was apparent right away that it'd be a problem. Even in split keyboard I never found the typing to be super reliable when unfolded. It took a while to get used to but I'm constantly mistyping regardless
The cameras are also quite lacking. For the Fold 3 I paid a large premium for a phone that lacked high end features in sacrifice to having a large foldable screen. 
Now these things weren't really a problem except I started to ask myself what is my use case for the phone? Large screen went out the door when I bought a Tab s7+ and it's not doing a great job as a camera or a regular sized display.
I figured some people are wanting to try out foldable phones and they're great, but if it works for you is completely up to how you'll use it. Anyone else make a similar switch? How do you feel about the foldables?"	N

S21+ to S22 Ultra or S23 Ultra?	"Hello guys,
I   would like to ask for help. I RMAd my S21+ and got money back, so now   I'm in process of buying new phone (using original iPhone SE now). I  had  numerous issues with S21+, which some of them resulted in RMA. I'm   thinking about Ultra version now as it should be the best.
What   bothered me with my S21+ was subpar photo quality, especially in   telephoto - noise, artifacts, etc. Next there was quite the shaking in   zoomed videos, much more, than with my S10+, making videos unwatchable,   no change of stabilization settings made a difference. I RMAd it  because  of serious heating,which resulted in uncomfortable feeling  while making  calls, etc. Battery depleated really fast, especially in  last 10%,  signal reception was worse than mid tier Xiaomi phones on  same spot.  Fingerprint reader had a lot of ghost touches resulting in  it being  constantly blocked in pocket and on desk, etc. As you can see,  I  probably got bad piece, but would S22 Ultra solve my issues? Or  should I  wait for S23 Ultra and hope for Snapdragon? I can buy only  Exynos now.
Thank you for help."	N
S21 - S23 design is a let down. S22 plus is prime.	I own the S21 Ultra. I saw no point in upgrading to the S22 because to le they are the exact same phone. The S22 Plus design looks so nice and wide. I'm tired of how long the phone are getting. That's the only design I like from Apple. I wish the S23 looked like thr S22 Plus. With more colors. Same screen, better cameras.

S22 Ultra optimization problems	I am growing sick and tired of my phone's inability to shut off apps in the background even when I manually put them in deep sleep. I am currently going through my third occurrence with the problem. I have had to completely factory reset my phone the last 2 times. The last time this happened was last month with the 'nearby services' being on in the background 24/7. It caused my phone to drain battery really fast, get extremely hot and cause alot of throttling. I couldn't even text properly because my inputs would be so delayed. This time (today) it is with paypal. I got a notification saying that the app is causing stress in the CPU and gave me an option to close it, so I did. I keep a close eye on my battery percentage so I know when something is off. I took my phone off the charger at 6:50am, it is now 9:10 am and my phone will normally be at around 85-89%. It is currently at 69% with only 45min of SOT. I go to see what's going on and what do you know paypal is at the top of the list just eating up battery in the background just like those other 2 times with different apps. I'm sick of this bro. Luckily for me, this time, it's doing it with an app I can actually uninstall and NOT a system function. Just uninstalled it to see if that fixes it.	N

S22 Ultra dual sim questions.	I just ordered an S22 Ultra from Verizon. I am planning to have one physical sim (verizon) and one e-sim (verizon) on the phone. I was curious if anyone is running their device this way and if they have had any weird issues doing so? Or if they have noticed a large difference in battery drain? I currently have my S21+ setup this way and have noticed that sometimes it will take a while for the other sim to be available for use after a call on the other sim. So was just curious is this is standard for dual sim operation since both can't be active at the same time. Or if it is just a weird issue with my S21+ that hopefully won't be an issue on the S22 Ultra.	N

The S20 Ultra has 100% battery capacity, extra RAM, arguably a more efficient SOC in the 865, and a nicer feel in the hands. I haven't noticed any autofocus issues. 
S22 Ultra has way better cameras, better design, and the S-Pen. However, I am so torn between these 2 phones due to the price difference. Anyone else find themselves comparing these two (assuming Snapdragon variants)?"	N

Factory reset, set RAM Plus to 0, and this phone is flying again.	"My phone (Snapdragon) has been getting progressively slower in launching apps, the camera, etc, and at least two of the Verizon OTA updates ""failed,"" so I finally decided to bite the bullet and back up my files and factory reset.
It has been five days, and there is a seriously noticeable improvement in the responsiveness of this phone. I have it more or less set up exactly the same way it was before, but I also ran the adb command to set RAM Plus to 0, and the phone is exceptionally responsive now. I don't think it has ever been this quick, even on day 1 back in February. I would say that battery life seems to be better as well, but I don't have any quantitative data to back it up. I just notice that I have over 70% battery life after being out all morning when I would normally be down to 55 or 60%.
I know factory resetting is the pits, but this phone seriously went from a 7.5 to a 9.5 for me. Truthfully it was fast again even without doing the RAM Plus tweak (it was set at 4GB out of the reset).

S22 Ultra Exynos performance questions	"Hey everyone, I've been meaning to upgrade my phone recently and I was waiting to see the new iphones being released and got pretty disappointed so I thought maybe it's time to switch to the android side for now.
I also noticed that my local carriers are offering 200 euro gift cards when you purchase a S22 series phone. So it got me into looking at the S22 ultra and questioning how the exynos performance is.
I've heard that the Snapdragon variant is superior but since I don't consider myself a ""power user"" I was wondering how it would hold up? I also barely play any games on phones, maybe few times a year.
So just mainly asking from everyone owning the exynos variant if the updates on it have made it any better. Also how buggy is the phone? I've read a lot that the phones have a lot of random issues, from apps crashing, lagging, wifi connections not working properly etc."	N

I moved to S22 plus from Huawei P30. This is WhatsApp I think	"Overall, S22 it's obviously a better phone, but there are some things that I miss:
Taking screenshots with gestures, in P30 you could select with your knuckles what part of the screen use, in S22 it's just swipe all your palm, it's just weird.
The gestures from the right side of the screen to go back or open the side panel, just works better on P30, it's smoother.
The clock widget, I like to have a clock and weather widget, but in S22 the characters are tiny and can't be modified, and also the weather doesn't  update automatically.

2) When in direct sunlight or even a well-lit room, adjusting the brightness past 40% does nothing. It doesn't get visibly brighter, even when maxed out. It just looks like 40% brightness. This doesn't happen in darker rooms

Video recording better after updates?	The video of these cameras was always where I was most disappointed. The photos were great but the video actually looked bad, the processing made them unusable imo. However, after OneUi 5 releasing I feel like it has gotten much better.

I could be totally crazy and I'd be confused if there happened to be no changes, but it seems likely considering the capture lag of taking photos has been much improved. Anyone experiencing this?	N

s22 ultra's 100x zoom vs s20 ultra	So it's something that's been bugging me for a while but I've kind of just been ignoring it. As someone who bought the s20 ultra and the s22 ultra, I can't help but feel like the s20's pictures were clearer and better overall in the 100x zoom. I am specifically talking moon pictures as I love to take pics of the moon. I find the s22 ultra pictures more blurry/less defined. To the point where I take far less pictures simply because I get annoyed. I bought the s22 ultra because of the s pen being standard and I didn't think I'd be sacrificing any picture quality. Do I just have a bust with my particular device? Or has anyone who owned both phones noticed a difference?	N
Returned my normal s22 for a s22 plus and battery seems same/worse	Considering battery is almost 1000mh bigger, I would expect at least an hour or two of extra screen on time.

GPS extremely inaccurate - how to fix?	"Hi!
I bought an S22 Ultra in February, the Exynos version. It worked fine the first few months, but this summer the GPS became terribly inaccurate (a problem many others seem to have had this spring). I can barely use Google maps, it knows *very* generally where I am, but it can differ entire blocks.

magsafe case spen issues	So I recently bought a magsafe case for the s22 ultra, and it said it doesn't interfere with the s-pen, even though it has a magnet in it, it said it's shielded and, while the s-pen does still work with it, I have to press pretty hard on the screen where the magnet is, so it's causing issues, to the point where, I just take the case off everytime I need to use the it, Or else there is dead zones on the screen, unless I press uncomfortably hard. I'm an artist, and so I use the S-pen quite often, I was hoping someone would be able to recommend a good case for the s22 that still allows for the magsafe functionality while also not interfering with the s-pen. Thanks!	N
Ok so important question.	"So the 14 Pro max has had some noticeable upgrades such as higher resolution action video (super steady alternative name) and cinematic video. Also the phone uses its middle sensor to crop to 2x resulting in alot better than Samsungs 2x. The 3x is better quality than 3x of Samsung. I am a Samsung fan boy so this really aches me. I think the s23 ultra will try to lessen this gap. So do you think the upgrades it get like maybe 2k super steady video will be coming to s22 ultra in an update?

Samsung s22 Ultra is probably the worst and most problematic phone i've ever seen (opinion)	"Before you downvote me for having a different opinion, hear me out 
ever since I got this phone it constantly randomly rebooted (the setting to do this willingly is turned off)
This is the most annoying thing I've ever had with a phone, every time I take it out of my pocket it's rebooting. I cleared the system cache, turned off Bixby (which is the most horrendous thing anyway), and troubleshoot it constantly for it to not work.
Until these issues are resolved it's just a very very mid phone, shame I'm stuck with it for the next 3 years until the contract runs out"	N

About the battery...	"I've had my S22U since the beginning of September but I've been following this thread since its release.
All along the months, I've been reading up on people acquiring this phone and many facing the same issue. The Battery.
Having owned this device for over 2 weeks now, I think I should share my experience with the device. 
Yes, I had poor battery life at the beginning of the usage, I was loosing 10% every hour without fail and most days even more. And because of everything I had read, I was more invested in battery life than I normally would be. But as the days have gone by, I cared less and less and less and just went on about my day. Until today, when I ended work and checked my phone and had 60% left after 8 hours of usage (3h sot, 3h standby).
I can't say this stands for everyone, but I'm sure most would agree that give the phone 2 weeks at least before getting worried. Within these two weeks, your phone will heat up. Your phone will use more battery. But it will most certainly go away and you will get your money's worth shortly after. 
I'm loving this phone.

Exporting RAW images. Snapseed or Lightroom	"Hi reddit,
For photography i mainly use Expert RAW app for 16bit raw photos. I was using snapseed for edditing raw pictures and then lightroom for final touch.
Today i found out that if u download Lightroom from galaxy app you have an option to edit raw photos (thats why i was using snapseed, cuz lightroom from google play does not support raw editing on free version).
Now i noticed something strange. In snapseed all raw photos looks dark, as RAW photos should look like... But  here in lightroom, raw photos look the same as jpeg preview of RAW photos. I checked info and i can see that it is a raw file but i want it to be dark like raw should look like.

Is there anyway to force a dark mode on webpages inside Samsung Internet?

A few honest words (not a rant)	"A few months ago I've been going through a rather difficult phone hunt. My OnePlus 5t was on its last legs and I was struggling to find something built for photography and video. 
I stumbled upon this subreddit and at first was put off by the harsh reviews of the Exynos variant. Decided not to buy it (buying Snapdragon variant was almost impossible  without additional hassle or steep markup).
Another few weeks of phone hunt went on, I have been eyeing OnePlus 10 and various Xiaomis, Asus Zenfone 9 was not out yet, in other words it was tough. I didn't want inferior experience with buggy UI or built in ads, especially with rather premium prices for either phone.
Finally I decided to go with S22u Exynos. My mindset was ""if I don't like it, I'll just return it"". Anyway, the package came in and I started using my s22u without high expectations. Few days later, battery life improved, I got to use the cameras, experienced smoothness of the screen, played a few games (just to try it out, as I'm not much of a phone gamer) and frankly, I enjoyed all of it. 
Now, I'm not saying it's an 11 out of 10 phone, there are still some things that require improvement, I still carry a power brick to sometimes charge it during the day (especially when I'm using the phone to shoot videos, make reels etc) but you know what? It's fine! I believe it's one of the best smartphone experiences I could get and until something breaks I'll just keep using this phone. 
It always boils down to the same thing: expectations vs reality, if you expect too much, hype yourself up to the maximum, nothing will match your expectations and you'll be disappointed. 
Another thing is tailoring the experience. You know disabling unwanted stuff, enabling desired functionalities, using preferred icon pack and launcher, designing some automations (or routines), etc. 
It's a good phone, just don't expect it to cure cancer or something, and you will not be disappointed."	N

AOD Samsung S22 Ultra	Talking of AOD. OnePlus has this feature that it uses proximity sensor when using AOD. If you put phone in pocket or face down , within 5 seconds AOD turns off. This is brilliant as compared to Samsung's AOD implementation where it just stays on when set to show always. Samsung should implement it, what you guys suggest?	N
Probably an un-popular opinion but I feel like there should be a separate sub reddit for Exynos and Snapdragon users.	Mainly because Exynos has major glaring issues that Snapdragon doesn't. For months there have been several posts with people trashing the s22u simply because they purchased a inferior product(Exynos) Not to mention the 3-5 page goodbye posts about people finally selling off their phone and wanting to document their "horror story" with their phone. I feel like this is a big misrepresentation for someone coming here looking to get feedback on purchasing a s22u with a SD chip and finding nothing but negative posts about the Exynos version.	N

Galaxy MahXz aggresive 10hz refresh switch	"Hi! I've been using Galaxy MaxHz app for a couple of days (someone on Reddit recommended it) and I noticed that when set to 10hz minimum it changes refresh rate very aggressively, making content hard to watch.
When I set min refresh rate to 24 hz it detects when I have gif/video on screen and stays in 120hz mode and everything stay smooth, but when set to 10hz minimum, it goes to 10hz refresh rate after just about 2-3s and while scrolling through reddit, it just makes every video seem like a slideshow. All videos are playing smoothly for a 2-3 seconds, and then slidshow starts.
Anyone had a similiad problem or know how to configure/improve this? Is this normal?
Edit: I was thinking about buying this app, mainly because it can do 120hz in battery save mode (Samsung restricts it to 60hz) + it can save me some juice while going down to 10hz, but for now, it's a dealbreaker for me."	N

last 2 updates made this phone perfect?	"Been switching between my S22 Ultra and S21 Ultra as the S21 Ultra is still a tad more refined until either this 2nd august update or the new September update.
Im noticing this phone is now lasting me all day again with medium use and around 6-7+ hours sot or more if usage isnt heavy and im not on maps and soundcloud all day.
Camera on the S21U seems more consistent and easier to take photos, less shutterlag and detail smoothing, runs slightly cooler, its smoother etc. Now it seems the opposite. The S22U finally does many things better than my S21U, and the camera and detail smoothing seems massively improved.
The S22 Ultra just didnt run as good as the S21U which makes me think its software related as the S21U has gone thru around 25+ updates or more now, probably 30 while the S22U is maybe on the 9th or 10th one now.
Finally one of these last 2 updates has made my S22 Ultra ridiculously smooth, virtually all micro stutters are gone, and the phone doesnt lag heavily when warm or throttling anymore. Jumping between apps is instant and buttery now with virtually 0 stutters which is how the S21 Ultra is....
Knock on wood but it also is running cooler... i was using it about 40 minutes and i was starting to get hot myself and my hand was quite warm but battery temp was actually quite low at only 92.5 F or 33 celsius which suprised me as i closely monitor battery temps and expected it a tad warmer although my S22U has generally ran pretty cool."

T-Mobile / Samsung Messages	For those of you who have t-mobile and use Samsung Messages, do you have RCS? And is SM capable of seeing reactions from iPhone users like Google Messages? Basically, what advantages does SM on t-mobile have over GM on t-mobile. I'm currently on Fi, and I'm thinking about switching gave I can't use RCS on SM.	N
Screen S21U vs S22U	"I was planning on buying the S22U. But when I got at the shop I was suprised to find the S21U screen to be much better. The curves on the S22U are much more pronounced discolored and the viewing angle is terrible, it turns really green when viewed at an angle, the S21U doesn't do that. (All the demo's had it)
At the moment, the S21U is even 150‚Ç¨ more expensive!
Should i buy the S21U?
Edit: the s22 and s22+ also suffer from the terrible green discolored view angle."	N
What causes lower cpu scores?	"I've been using geekbench and 3dmark for months to keep my phone's performance in check after updates &amp; whatnot and i noticed that sometimes I'll get different scores for cpu &amp; gpu tests even if the temperature is almost identical. All settings would be the same and no extra tabs open. 
This question concerns cpu performance because I've done tests in very similar conditions and gotten high scores at one point and low scores at another.
So what are the possible causes of lower cpu scores or prolonged low scores?"	N
Google Messages dual sim mms.	"I just got an S22 Ultra and have my personal Verizon sim and work e-sim in the phone with the personal sim as primary. 
The issue is with Google Messages I can't send or receive MMS messages with the work e-sim unless I change the e-sim to primary. With Samsung Messages it works fine MMS works on both Sims simultaneously. 
Is there a fix for this?"	N

Samsung Care+	I called Samsung and tried to buy the Care+ through Samsung and it wouldn't let the lady do it. I'd rather have it than Ausrian they are crappy and just send you crappy Refurbished 3rd party crap if you need a new phone. I'd rather deal directly with Samsung. Phone was bought St Verizon corporate store in USA on June 30, 2022. Thanks.	N
any help would be really appreciated	Hi thinking of getting a s22u on Monday have a few doubts though appreciate any help. I'm in the UK is the exynos version really that bad? Is the camera lag fixed? And lastly is exynos version still terrible for gaming? Cheers for any help.	N
Well, looks like this is it. My (hopefully) last thread in this subreddit	"Exynos here. Since the very first day I bought the phone, it has been only issues after issues, frustration after frustration. My journey with this phone began with nothing but lags, glitches, system UI crashes, poor battery, poor performance poor pictures, an overall never-ending nightmare. ""There's a big update coming that will fix everything"". That's what I kept reading on the internet. Then the big update came. Nothing much improved. ""No, wait, the next one will be the one"" I read. And that update came. Still nothing. ""The next one will SURELY bring the much needed improvement"". 6 months in, the only thing that changed is I couldn't return my phone anymore. 
I start writing here about my issues. Some of you were very understanding with acknowledging the inferiority of exynos chip, saying that it wasn't fair I paid the same price for an inferior product. Some exynos owners suggested factory resetting. I did it 6 times. Nothing. Some said to change this and that setting. Slight, marginal improvements to the battery, maybe? I wasn't able to tell anymore. The phone still wasn't nowhere to being fine for that price point. Some other people said ""clearly you got a defective unit. Bring it to customer support"". 
And so I did. I brought it to customer support, stating all my issues: the phone was slow, had constant crashes, battery was terrible, the screen was displaying white static noise every once in a while (even if rarely, even if for brief moments, I'm pretty sure that ain't normal) and to top it all, it was not performing well at the only area this was sponsored at: being the best phone on the market at taking pictures. Well, my phone almost always takes terrible pictures. Unless it's in broad daylight, with no wind, on a static object or person and pray to whatever god is available at that moment to listen to my prayers. 
I followed every instruction here to get good quality pictures, played with the iso, shutter speed, nothing works. The phone's camera hardware for what I read and understood is fine, but the chip's image processing just isn't any good. Anyway, after bringing the phone to customer support, I got the phone back the same day with the following report: ""no issues found"". The only thing they did was to reset my phone. This is the 7th factory reset in total. Yet another reinstallation of everything, hours wasted and my phone STILL wasn't fine. 
Grief and frustration settle in. I had a very expensive brick that performed so much worse than my 2018 Huawei phone. ""Why? I paid so much for this product. Why do I have to go through so much pain?"" I told myself. I just couldn't bear it anymore. Today, I finally sold my phone via eBay and, unless something drastic changes, I will finally get rid of this piece of junk in 10 days. 
Needles to say, I had to sell it for almost half the price I bought it because, although I kept it in mint condition (not a dent or scratch, with all the original plastics around the phone), it is used and now even brand new after six months they lowered the price for the 256gb version from 1400 to about 1000. I guess, considering all the issues the customers are getting with the phone (just look this subreddit, Samsung forums or the internet in general), after only 6 months they had to lower the prices to sell some.
After sending the phone to the buyer, I will unfollow this subreddit. My awful journey with Samsung ends here. I will never trust this company again. This is the last Samsung I'll ever buy.
This is my full and honest review with owning an S22 ultra for 6 months. Hope this review helps someone who is considering buying an exynos s22 ultra.
Goodbye, everyone. Thanks to all the people who tried to help me fix this mess of a phone, I'm wishing you all the best in life."	N
where did you buy your phone from?	"Good Afternoon. 
I'm heading up to London on Monday to view the queen's funeral and I want to take some quality videos and pictures while I'm there. I don't have the money to invest in a proper camera so the S22 Ultra is the next best thing, I could do with an upgrade after using this busted S8 for so long. 
Where did you buy yours from?
I've found the 256GB model for ¬£1049 on Appliancesdirect, but that's the lowest price I've found. I would wait until Black Friday and hopefully save myself a little cash but then I'd miss out on some quality pictures of my trip. 
Just want to make sure I'm getting the best deal I possibly can as I'm not that well off aha
Edit: ended up taking that deal from AppliancesDirect. It was over ¬£1,200 on Samsung's website, and trading in my current phone only gave me a ¬£100 discount. It arrives tomorrow?"	N
Fullscreen photos on AOD.	"If we Samsung users have to admit something about iOS16 is that  their AOD implementation is interesting for just 1 reason: Fullscreen pictures.
Is there a way to enable that?

Worst customer support EVER. Not repairing my phone.	"So I purchased Samsung S22 ultra 512gb Black model 3-4 months ago and a month ago my phone didn't want to turn on at ALL. So I called Samsung and I sent it in for repairs. They repair most of the internals but when I got it back, it was call scratched up. The lens at the bottom back was scratch, the top part of the phone and 2 micro scratch on the screen.
I've babied this phone to the max, it had NO scratches, dents or damage anywhere on the body. I also took multiple photos and videos of the phone before sending it out. 
So I called Samsung and told them about my situation and they said my only option was to make a new ticket and send it back to repairs but I really didn't want to do that because the same lady told me that the Samsung Repair Department said when they got the phone it was already scratch up which is FALSE. 
SO I gave in because it wasn't going no where and she made me a ticket told her the details on what II want to be repair on my phone and I sent it out again few days ago but before sending it back. I took photos of the damage and video and how I packed it up. I also wrote 2 letters and place it inside the box stating what was the problem and what had to be fixed with the phone. Few days later I got a phone call by Samsung Repair Department stating what had to be repair even though I wrote 2 letters in the box and all of that information should be in there system already. So I told him and even he spotted it out when I told him the situation and he had my phone in hand when he called me.
Today I got an email from Samsung and in the email it said ""  Service request to be shipped back unrepaired"" like WTF is going on OVER THERE!?!?!?!? I'm going to keep sending it back until they get tired of me but this is so much wasted time. What should I do? I bought this phone with my debit card sadly and don't know if i could do a dispute or not. Or just take my lost and see the phone and go with an iPhone. 
Any help please?!?!"	N
Iphone 14pro vs S22u	"I have a oneplus 7 pro. Really like it, only want a new phone since it is no longer getting security updates. I have had iphones before and this is my second android phone since switching from iphone (7s I believe).  
I don't use apple anything, I run PC and the only Apple product I have is an old Ipad my dad handed down to me so that I can do readings for school easier on that. I don't plan on getting apple products to replace what I already have if I go to an Iphone. I have Samsung BT earbuds that work great and do what I need, I don't really use my galaxy smart watch so don't see myself getting an apple watch. I don't care about 'ecosystem' as I plan to minimize as I don't like the idea of being locked to a system. If the product is better and replaces something that is broken or I can't do already it doesn't matter what company it comes from imo. I know apple things work better with apple things, not the reason I want the iphone, just want that to be clear.  
I like the look of the iphone 14pro, reminds me a lot of the iphone 4 I had (first smartphone) and I like the look of it. I also like the hardware sound control, one of the reasons I went with the One plus 7 pro. I like the battery life and the new features of the iphone 14pro so wouldn't really consider getting a older version. I don't want to get another phone for hopefully 3 plus years. I like the look of the dynamic island as dumb of a name that is. However I am concerned about video playback experience, I mostly watch videos on my phone and I don't play mobile games. I like the magnetic charging thing they got, I use magnets to mount my phone in my car so that would be nice not to have to add metal to the back of my phone, the charging through it seems gimmicky tho, so I doubt I would use it much for that purpose. I am  not a fan of a cut out of any kind in my display hence me having a 7pro for this long. However every phone has that shit now so doesn't really seem like there is much I can do about that now. I am also not a fan that the iphone is still using the lightening cable, I already have a bunch of usbc cables and rather not have to pay apple tax to get similar things at double the price.  
I like the features of the S22u, especially the S-pen. Seems to me a better feature that I would actually use rather than some satellite emergency phone system that I doubt I would ever use then feel the need to pay for it in two years when it isn't free anymore. I already use android things and that includes Samsung earbuds and watch so integration would be easier but again I don't care about ecosystem, as long as it connects via BT or something I don't really care. For watching videos and doing what I do on phones most of the time I could see myself liking the Samsung more but it would only be marginally. I prefer finger print unlock over faceunlock. I find there are more times that I have already unlocked my phone before I even look at it defeating the so called 'speed' advantage of faceID using a finger print sensor. I am not really a fan of the shape or the looks of the S22u however. Not that is a deal breaker but it just looks meh to me. Too many cameras on the back, 3 has been more than enough for me and I think I only really use the normal one 90% of the time anyways. More features tho so can't really complain about it, again just a meh looking phone. I am not a fan of the rounded screen at the edges. Didn't like it on the 7pro so can't imagine the S22u will be much better for that. I have also heard bad things about the battery life of this phone. One of the issues I have now with my 7pro is it no longer lasts all day. Even after a battery swap. If this phone has issues out the box for that I won't like that. I used to go a day or two without charging now I need to charge twice a day sometimes (i don't charge overnight).  
Money isn't an issue, both phones are offered by my carrier as an upgrade to my phone. Looks wise I like iphone, feature wise I think it goes to S22u but leaning Iphone 14 pro still for battery life, phone life (updates n shit) and to try something new. Feel like it will be less annoying to get an S22u however with all the ecosystem bs, getting new cables and accessories.   
Would appreciate to hear from people who have had both platforms in the last 5 years or even people who have tried both before deciding on one or the other. I am planning on going to a local Best Buy to see if I can get hands on before I make a final decision. Figure I see what reddit thinks in the mean time."	N
Get GCAM For Every Samsung Galaxy Device Exynos and Snapdragon		N
[S22] Photography underwater	Hi, I have S22 (mini) this is my first water-resistant phone. and I'm wondering if I can use the phone to take videos while snorkeling in the sea?	N
Dropped S22 in water	"I've been able to get the charger working again, should I be worried about water damage to the screen, will the camera be okay?
Thanks,  
Markus"	N
will the problems with the s22 ultra (Exynos) be fixed?	"I have a s22 ultra and I really want to like the phone, but  the system-UI has been freezing or crashing when using apps like genshin impact or watching videos or multitasking. There are other problems, but the fact that my phone is crashing or freezing on a game like genshin when my old huwei p30 pro can easily run the game without crashing is a problem to me.
If the phone doesn't get better I will just return it or sell it, but if there is hope I might keep it. I was planning on keeping this phone for at least 3,5 years."	N
S22 - where 5% battery is the new 0% battery	"Gonna gripe about battery... I was on a s8+ and moved to s22. I could let it die down to 0%. Then plug it in and a couple seconds later turn it on. 
With the new phone,  5% then shutdown.  Then I have to wait about 5 min before it shows me the charge indicator and I can then restart the phone.  What gives??? Seems worse."	N
Should I get the s22 plus?	"Hi everyone. So i've had the galaxy s9 since 2018 and its time for an upgrade. The screen is shattered and there's black blobs on the display, the battery is draining faster than it use to, apps are malfunctioning, and as somebody who LOVES taking photos, the camera is clearly outdated and I would love top of the line camera performance. I've had my eye on the s22 plus, and it seems like a great phone, but all the complaints about the battery life concern me. It's probably my biggest setback about buying the phone. For reference I average around 5 hours of SOT and charge my s9 twice a day. I don't play games on my phone but I do use apps like facebook, snapchat, insta, tiktok, and youtube. Plus I use my camera somewhat frequently when im out and about. I have read that the battery life can improve as it adapts to your usage.
Alternatively to the s22 plus, I've had my eye on the iphone 13 due to better battery life. There are things that worry me about switching to iphone as someone whose only used samsung, like lack of USB c and the fear of losing my data since ive heard that the switch to iOS app doesnt ever work properly, but battery life is a HUGE factor for me and I have been curious about what using an iphone is like. I am really struggling with this decision right now. They both seem like great phones!
Edit: a few people are suggesting I wait for the s23 lineup, but im really unsure how much longer I can hold off. The screen is driving me nuts and the battery is slipping by the day. At this point it feels more logical to just buy a new phone rather than paying to get the screen and battery replaced."	N
What's your longtime review of S22+?	"I am deciding between iPhone 13 (256GB) and S22+ (256GB, Qualcomm variant).
I wanna know how's the battery life?
Also, can you tell me about the heating issues considering it's got 8 Gen 1?
I do like to game. And also binge watch Netflix, Prime, a lot. I also use social media platforms like Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, Telegram, WhatsApp, etc. too. 
I am a moderate to a heavy user.
Do you guys think S22+ would be a right fit for me?
Edit: I am not the biggest fan of iPhone still having a 60Hz screen or slow charging and am lifetime android user so if I could help it, I'd still to Android. The only reason I am considering iPhone is because it's available for the same price as android and there are not many good android options thanks to 8 Gen 1
If you have any other suggestions or recommendations, I am all ears.
*EDIT 2:* I forgot to mention, I'd using whichever device I pick with 2 SIMs"	N
S22, S22+, S22U, Pixel 6 pro or wait	Hi all. Currently rocking a OnePlus 7 Pro since 6 months after launch. ATT will give me $800 trade in towards S22/Plus/U or the Pixel 6/Pro.

Hz for S22	" 
Hello.
I've seen advised to try out this app ( [GalaxyMaxHzPub](https://github.com/tribalfs/GalaxyMaxHzPub) )
I've installed it and it seems useful already (I've set the minimum hz).
Now I want to try more features of this app, for which I need adb rights. But I'm hesitating a bit. Does granting those rights somehow ruin the phone? I remember rooting deprives you from the official Samsung warranty.
So, is there any danger from installing adb rights?"	N

S22 Ultra is only a 500 mAh difference, .2 inches bigger, S Pen and boxy design (which I don't think will be practical in my life), so is it even worth getting the Ultra over the plus?

Important s22 ultra display	For those who bought an s22 ultra or any phone from the s22 series. Buying a screen protector is is essential. I recently sold my s22 ultra after changing to the iPhone 14 pro max and 200sgd(140 usd) was knocked of my selling price by the shop thus the price dropped from 1130usd (800usd) to 930sgd (660usd) due to scratches on my screen. I only used the phone for about 3 months as I bought it in May. I‚Äôm usually very careful with my phones as well, the previous phones I sold to the same stall, s21 plus and note 10 plus among the others never had this issue even using them for a year. So if you own an s22 ultra, please buy any screen protector.	N

Is there any power bank that support Samsung 45w charging?	"Been looking for power bank that can do 45w charge for my handset for a while and I finally find one (Goshtek something model) which is pretty pricey but I've been informed that it can do 45w charging on all Samsung models except S22+ and S22U (which it only do 25w)
Probably doesn't matter but given how expensive this thing is, it kinda left a sour taste in my mouth. The manufacturer said, it's probably due to Samsung firmware, which makes sense because other power banks like the Electrojet which is known to support Samsung 45w, also only supports up to S21 officially (and even Samsung's own power supply only do 25w)
So I am a bit curious, S22U simply not support SFC 2.0 via any power bank or it's just this particular model that is lacking? I might keep looking if it's the former but otherwise, might as well just pull the trigger."	N

Screen protector with fingerprint sensor still functioning?	"I'm searching for any kind of screen protector (glass, film, etc) that also allows me to use the ultrasonic fingerprint reader. 
So far I have tried UltimateShield which didn't work at all with the sensor. PanzerGlass and a similar lesser known brand was my second and third option. Both worked with low succes rate. About every 8th time it authenticated me. 
I also turned on the high sensitivity and registered my fingerprint after installing them."	N
"Quick" app search?	"On the iPhone, a feature i used all the time was to swipe to the search, and the keyboard would instantly pop up and allow me to start to type for an app and open it.  
On my S22u (and, probably other android), if I swipe up for the app drawer, i have to then hit the search at the top to then start a search.  Its a little difference, but, in one-handed mode, (because the phone is so big) it does make searching pretty tedious.  It's not the biggest pain in the world, but, I find myself noticing that i am doing this quite a bit.  i can probably make better use of folders, etc, but, is there a way to enable a 'quick' search in the app area where it is just ""ready for input"" (ie, like the iphone)?"

About Always on Display...	"Guys, is it possible to have AOD show up when I get a notification, and then after some seconds have it turn off automatically?

My question is, is the rattling sound a problem for the S22 Ultra? or is that magnet to keep the camera stable? don't mind my stupid question."	N

Will S22 Ultra (Exynos) last day of heavy usage?	"Hello guys,
I would like to buy a S22 Ultra and want to ask about battery life. I know it's not that best, but I would like for it to take me through one day of heavy usage securely like my S10+ did.
As heavy usage I see 2 hours of GPS car navigation in the morning, browsing web and taking photos through day, occasional Pokemon GO or other games (I'm not heavy mobile gamer) and after that ride back with GPS navigation. All in like 7 am to 7 pm. I'm able to put it on charging in the car on ride back.
Can S22 Ultra do this? Thank you very much for help."	N
Is the S22 any good for heavy gaming?	Ive heard theres battery and heating issues. Have these been resolved or should i look for something else?	N
S22 vs S10	"So we upgraded to a 5G data plan and I'm considering upgrading my aging S10.  I'm not seeing huge benefits to upgrading my s10 other than the 5G capability.   
Are there other side benefits with newer tech that you guys have seen? Ie. I am raging every other day with BT connectivity.  Stuff like this maybe has improved?"	N
Base S22 Battery Life?	"Currently sitting on a broken S9, ready to move up.
S22 seems nice, but I hear mixed stuff about the battery. Has it improved with Android 13? Is it as bad as people say? I'd be a US-based user with the Snapdragon version based on what my carrier has.
On my S9 I basically use Facebook, Youtube, Reddit, Discord, email, and general Internet browsing. No gaming, no streaming, no shows or movies. As of right now this old phone needs charging before I head out the door for work after maybe 3 hours of use, and might be 15 or 20 percent when I get home after only using it during breaks.
So I'm curious if an S22 will likely also be limping by the time I finish up a 12-hour day and get home, or if I can expect better than people seem to suggest."	N
I Lost My Galaxy S21, What Phone Should I Get? (S22 bad battery?)	"I loved my Galaxy S21, never had any problems whatsoever, the build was beautiful, battery life decent, perfect size. But now it's gone and I need a new phone. I want the S22, but I've read the S22's battery-life is terrible. S21 Fe is supposedly better battery life, but I hate big phones, and the S21 FE is like 3 inches bigger than the S21.
Pixel 6a is a nice size and seems like a good phone, but I'll probably miss my S21. iPhone 14 seems really good in a similar size to the S21, but I'm not sure about the apple ecosystem. I'm in google.
Why would Samsung make the battery smaller in the S22? What kind of stupid decision was that? Even apple knows to invest in better batteries these days.
What should I do?"	N
Galaxy S22 Ultra Snapdragon dropped 20% overnight in airplane mode. Is this normal?	"Update 5: After removing my work / 365 account, I still lost 20% overnight. I thought it might be a wonky InTune policy, but I was wrong. Next in line is my Google account. I'm going to disable and let my phone sit idle for an hour. Update soon to come
Update 4: I've removed my work / Outlook / 365 accounts and am charging to full before bed. I'll post another update in the morning.
Update 3: I went to a Samsung certified repair center. The results of the diagnosis was that my phone was trying to sync ""something"" all night long, even though I had airplane mode on. There is something that doesn't acknowledge airplane mode so it just continues to pound away until it can find a way to reach the internet. I'm going to pull each one of my accounts off of my phone one by one until something changes. Ultimately, it sucks like a bug in the code somewhere.
I feel like I'm at the end of the road with this phone. I just did an Odin reset last week and started from scratch. I've never had this sort of trouble with a phone.
Edit: I reached out to Samsung support. After asking me what troubleshooting steps I've tried, they offered me a ""great price"" to trade my S22 for a Fold 4. Seems like they're well aware of these issues
Edit 2: I have an appointment at an authorized service center this afternoon. I called ahead to confirm the appointment that Samsung support made for me. I asked a few questions and the tech on the phone said they have Samsung's (QiC?) troubleshooting software and it'll tell them everything down to the time of day. So I'm hoping they can hone in on the time I was asleep last night to find out what was happening. To give you all an idea of where I'm at today, I have 30 minutes of screen on time and I'm at 87% battery. I've already factory reset twice. I've already fiddled with sleeping and deep sleeping apps. I'm not using Always on Display. I've manually dropped to 4G/LTE and I'm very aware of which apps are using location services. There is a ton of advice out there for people with the same issue, but not everyone is having this issue. Seems to be 50/50 out there. I'll send another update when I'm back from my appointment"	N

Switch input and output devices during calls	"Hi,
I'm looking for a way to use my phone mic during a call while listening through my wireless earbuds.

I'm using a Galaxy S22 Ultra.
Is there a way to get what I'm looking for in a setting I haven't found yet or an app?

My advise for the Whitestone Dome users	"I have used the Whitestone Dome screenprotector since launched and I have never used my S22U without it. All this time I have been annoyed by the slowness of the fingerprint reader.
As the screenprotector began to chip some time ago I figured giving the official Samsung screenprotector a chance is worth a try. Yesterday I replaced the screenprotector and I have to say, this screenprotector is amazing and it solved all my problems!
No slow fingerprint reading, no hard pressing the screen. All without feeling like a cheap plastic screenprotector and being cheaper than the Whitestone Dome. 
I you are having troubles with the Whitestone Dome screenprotector aswell I would recommend you try the official Samsung one.
P.S.
Some customers are leaving bad reviews about the official Samsung screenprotector coming loose at the sides. This is probably the extra installation which you have to remove (as demonstrated in the included instructions)."	N

Need a new case.	I've been using an otter box defender pro. I just realized how hot my phone gets in it while charging. I'm considering buying a thinner case. The two I was looking at was Temdan and Spidercase since they have built in screen protector, but I'm willing to take other suggestions. I need something a little more breathable. After removing just the silicone part of the otter box my phone dropped 2-3 degrees allowing it to SFC better.id like a case I don't have to take off if possible. My phone does have tempered glass but it's scratched pretty bad so if the case I buy has a built in protector it can come off.	N

Used S21 or New S22?	"Hi all,
I was wondering about buying a Galaxy S22 but after my own research I'm thinking if a used Galaxy S21 is a better choice at this point.
I really value size and weight (love compact devices), years of support (in relation to the price) and features I'm nowadays used to like wireless charging, bluetooth strenght (for headset and Garmin sportwatch, bt speakers, etc).
I also think Samsung Dex is a nice to have and battery life the longer the better ofc. 
Considering that the Galaxy S21 should get other 3 Android versions and 4 years of security update, taking into account the prices for the used units and the almost no differences in terms of camera, performance and size with S22, it seems the absolute best choice.
Is there any great S22 feature that I'm missing out?"	N

Smartest things to do with a brand new S22?	"With my brand new Samsung Galaxy s22 256gb currently on its way to my mailbox, I want to know what should be the course of action when it's out of the box.

Any other tips battery wise? Should I just use the smart switch application to transfer my data or is it a better way?
Been having my s10 since 2018 so I am looking forward to a beefy upgrade considering there are two generations between my s10 and the s22.

Battery Drain After Beta	"This is for some of you that have been experiencing unusually high battery drain after installing the Beta. It may or may not help, and I am just sharing my personal experience. Your mileage may vary.
Also, I didn't post about it here when I experienced it, as Samsung Members was the place to post it. 
As some of you, once I installed the Beta version, my battery life diminished considerably. I never panicked or got all hysterical about it, I simply learned how adjust to it without using a saving mode (things like less music with Bluetooth earbuds, less web and social media browsing, etc).  I could usually take my phone to work, and at the end of my day, I had about 60% battery left. But after the update, I was in the lower teens. 
After I posted about it in Samsung Members, and got an official response that no issue could be found in my phones systems upload, I completely forgot about the Battery Tracker in Good Guardians. So I used it, and found that a music visualizer I had installed a few weeks back was killing my battery. As a matter of fact, it was accounting for over 30% of my battery after the Beta update. And even though it is a GREAT paid app for visualizations, both music and AOD, I uninstalled it. Now, my battery usage is back to normal exceptional use.
The name of the app is Muviz Edge, but if you don't have it installed, chances are that you problem is most likely an app that's not playing well with your phone, and not the phone itself as many would like to claim &amp; think. So if you are having battery drain issues, the first thing to do is look at your apps, and not complain about the phone because that's not the problem. I don't care what happened with your last phone, this one ain't the last one. Sometimes, that even means you even have to do a total reset of your phone, then install the apps back one by one (yes, I've done that before a few years back to find a rogue application). It's time consuming, but in the end I found the problem. And guess what...It was me, and not the phone.
So, before anyone else starts complaining about their battery life, take a look at the apps you've got running, and how they're running."	N

Encased Holster for Spigen Tough Armor... Not Available???	"Evening all. 
I was looking to get an S22+ (finally decided against the Pixel 6 Pro) and I was looking for a specific Spigen Tough Armor case and the Encased holster for the Tough Armor.  I've used both Tough Armor and Encased holsters on my Note 4's and 8's and they are WONDERFUL!  I love the TPU & polycarbonate hybrid case design that has protected my Note 8 countless times. 
However, it appears that the Encased S22+ holsters are simply not available anywhere!  Encased's website shows out of stock, Amazon and other sites simply don't have it available.  Does anyone know of somewhere to buy this holster for the Tough Armor case?  I have emailed Encased, but so far no response. 
If it's absolutely impossible to get the Tough Armor & Encased combo, what about the Slim Armor?  It looks to have less hard shell poly carbonate area than the Tough Armor and minus the new internal foam.  But it appears Amazon doesn't sell the Slim Armor for the S22+. 
It seems like if I want the Encased & Tough Armor combo, I either need to get the S22 Ultra or standard S22... both phones that aren't either in my budget, or a tad smaller than I would prefer.

Advice for S22 Ultra and Two Carriers	"Hi!  I'm a longtime Verizon customer.  I have a Samsung S10e and I'm in America (New England).
I bought a house ~4 blocks away from where I was renting since 2018 and was shocked to discover that my new house has horrible wireless service, as I had no issues in my other home.  Calls drop walking between rooms, going inside and outside the house, people can't hear me and hear digital noise although I can hear them.  When I measure signal strength inside and outside, it's about the same.  I live near a pond and have been told it is an issue with bouncing signals off the water.
I looked into signal boosters and they only helped a little. WiFi calling also helped a little but makes the problem worse when it comes to carrying calls between the car and the house, which I do frequently.  I have a case open with Verizon engineers but I'm not hopeful as this has been a documented problem since 2012 or so.  (If only I had thought to look before I bought the house!)
Anecdotally T-mobile is supposed to be better in the area.  But switching providers seems like a big hassle without confirmation.  So, since I need a new phone anyway, I had an idea.
I would like to get the Samsung S22 Ultra, because I need a new phone anyway, and get the $10/month T-mobile voice plan as a second line on the phone, because it comes with dual sim.  This way I could test whether T-mobile works better in my house, and theoretically I could switch if needed or keep both lines to ensure I always have coverage, as I do travel regularly.
My questions are... Are there any flaws with this plan?  Could I do this by getting my device through Verizon, or do I need to get the unlocked phone through Samsung?  I would prefer to get my phone through Verizon because I should be due for some loyalty rewards, but I don't want to wait 60 days to add the T-mobile sim or be locked into Verizon if I need to switch.  Also I'm wondering if I could set a workflow on the phone that calls coming into my Verizon line get automatically forwarded to the T-mobile line when in the vicinity of my house only."	N
love the S22 Ultra but missing Pixel 6 Pro's call-handling	Just about only thing I miss from my Pixel 6 Pro is the way that it would answer calls from unknown numbers for me ("call screening" I think it's called). On my S22 Ultra, calls from spam callers very often still ring the phone and annoy me. Is there a way to improve this? I've already played around in the settings and as far as I can tell, spam and robocall blocking is enabled. Just something the Pixel is better at?	N
Stuck between iPhone 13 PRO MAX and Samsung S22 ULTRA. Please advise.	"Hi &amp; thanks in advance for reading this,
About to purchase two new phones (one for my wife and one for myself) and I'm stuck between the iPhone 13 PRO MAX and Samsung's S22 ULTRA. I love SAMSUNG but currently, phones are pretty similar and **the only thing that matters in the end is performance.** Here's my Pros and cons for each device. 
iPhone Pros will be noted as (i) and Samsung as (s) 
PROS: 
Best performance (i)
Best display (s) , best design (s)
Pen (s)
Camera (i) (s) , front camera (i) , videos (i) 
Software support &amp; value (i) 
Apps, freedom, etc... (s) 
&amp;#x200B;
I have contemplated the idea of acquiring an S22U for myself and the iPhone 13PM for my wife but my friend, who's a Samsung fan advised me to go for the 13PM too. 
What do you guys think?"	N
Shutter lag in S22 Ultra?	"I have been a long time user of Android, and since every other Android device manufacturer sans Samsung left my market, they are the only option to buy a flagship Android.
Planning to upgrade to a S22 Ultra, and was checking the phone today in a shop. What I noticed is that there is a slight shutter lag between clicking the button and the pic being taken. Whereas the iPhone 13/14 is almost instant. This seems like a major issue for a phone that costs more than even the iPhone 14.
Has anyone noticed this issue? Is this due to the phone being a demo unit? I really like the Android platform and don't want to switch. But this seems like a serious issue for a flagship."	N

Should i get a base S22 from the Poco X3 Pro?	So, my Poco has been really good this last year, but i still kinda feel like it was more than it what actually was, i mean the camera is way better than what i had before (Xiaomi note 5 and 7), and performance wise it's pretty decent, but i want something that's actually really good, but im not expecting to pay as much for the S22 Ultra, and i've seen really mixed reviews on the base S22, so my question is: would it be a good jump from the Poco x3 Pro or is there a better option? like, i've seen i a couple of YT channels and sites that the Oppo Find x5 pro is also a beast, but i'd have to import it and it kinda scares me to get scammed or get a broken/faulty unit	N

You should try the Samsung Silicone case if you want a minimal case. Its really amazing.	"In the past i always bought Samsung protective rugged or soft touch silicone cases for my phones, and book covers for the tablets but i cheaped out this time to save $8. Big Mistake!
The reviews don't do it justice. Its destroys the spigen i bought initially in every criteria of mine.
\- Its lighter and less bulky than the spigen thin fit which really surprised me at first. I was fully expecting a heavy chunky feel but was wrong. Its feels like a skin.
\- it doesn't get as oily or dirty or sticky like my past note 9 and s21 silicone cases. Also a nice surprise but not a deal breaker if it was.
\- the corners soften the phone from digging into my hands. This was a huge problem for me. I no longer need to support the phone with my pinky.
\-the grip is perfect. Just enough friction to stop it from sliding but smooth enough to not feel rubbery and sticky. While being soft enough to squeeze comfortably.
In contrast the spigen was slippery plastic with a sharp manufacturing seam that hurt and felt cheap. If I gripped too hard it would hurt and if i gripped less it would slip out my hands. 
\- the lips. The Samsung has a nice thick forehead and chin lip for gripping in landscape for videos or resting face down. The Samsung also has lower side lips which not only look better as you can see the curve in all its glory but it prevents dust from getting stuck where the phone meets the case. A single wipe was all it took to keep it clean.
The spigen has higher sides that was so hard to clean the gunk out. When i took it off it was disgusting.
A case can truly enhance your experience from  tolerable to heavenly. I am going to get another as a spare when they drop to $10 eventually.
I didn't think i would ever review a phone case but this was too enjoyable not to share."	N

This is best phone I've ever had - exynos 3 weeks user	"Hi,
I am following this subreddit almost 1,5 mo because before buying s22u I wanted to check if it is worth to go for it. I saw many ppl are complaining about s22u, especially for exynos version.
I am s22u 8/128gb 3 week user and from my point of view:
this is the best phone I ever had.
I always had chinese ""flagships"". I am a person which don't like to pay more than something is worth. So I read alot that chinese phones are same as samsung and iphone flagships and cost 3x less. So I had xiaomi mi5, then xiaomi redmi 6 (oh this was totally worst phone I ever had I have to admit), then oneplus 6t, then realme x50 pro and xiaomi 11t. Every of this phone, expect redmi, was called flagship killer, and for years I believed that. Why should I buy samsung or iphone if xiaomi has same things. Well after 3 weeks of use I will say for sure, nah - xiaomi flagship is not same as samsung flagship. Design, components, cameras, software, everything is on samsung favor, and its same if I compare my old xiaomi 11T and samsung s22u. Ofc I can't say if spending additional few hundred of bucks is worth for this difference, but difference is real.
Maybe shortly after release s22u had problems with exynos version, but right now this phone is totally flying. 0 lags, 0 problems with anything. Battery on my xiaomi 11t with same usage was 8,5h sot, with s22u I got around 13h. Photos are amazing, maybe SD do them better, I dont know, but right now I really love how camera work, and it is beating easly my wife Iphone 13. Well if someone would offer me exchange my exynos for SD I wouldn't go for it, seriously. No throttling, beast in battery life and I am not gamer so I don't see any difference.
Just posting what this camera can do (well I am pretty proud of this photo never did even close on my previous phones to this one - and it is just easy 3x optical portrait mode done by full amateur)

verizon sending me a dud worse than my first dud	To make a long story short, bought one June 30 from verizon. Started tweeking out and freezing. After a pain in the butt process dealing with Samsung and vzw, vzw sent me a like new device aka refurbished and it's worse than my first one, this one has hepatic and vibration issues, over sensitive to touch and constantly clicks on junk I'm not clicking on. Vzw just wants fo send me another refurbished one. I am on the fence because I am debating just saying screw it. I opened an account and tmobile with a temporary number and got a 5g iPhone se. I am just so frustrated with Samsung and Verizon. I am debating porting my number to tmobile yet to see if vzw will get their head on straight. Ugh.	N

What's the best tempered screen protector for this?	"I have tried 3 different branda now and each time, either the protector comes off, starts breaking itself (yes, you read that right) or the fingerprint scanner becomes completely useless. All 3 bought from Amazon.
I have had several phones in the past saved by the Tempered screen protector so I do want to get that instead of the film (which doesnt do much). Would appreciate any advice."	N
Ok, fine, the Dbrand Grip case is awesome	"I've never really paid more thank $20 for a case in the past because I felt that that there were plenty of options that provided decent protection and aesthetics for that price point for normal use (I'm an IT guy, so don't work outdoors or in challenging environments), and particularly for flagship phones.  Never really felt the need to go above that.
So I had been running with the Ringke Onyx case for grippyness (great case btw).  My only issue with it was the P-shaped camera cutout.  Didn't really like the look of that, but I had those individual lens protectors on the cameras that didn't play well with cases with individual camera lens cutouts.  Then I recently decided to take those lens protectors off and get a case with the individual cutouts.  I have had Dbrand skins for previous phones before, and seeing so many recommendations on this sub for the Dbrand Grip, I decided to try it out.
My first impression (outside of the nice packaging) was the feel of the case.  The general texture of the case feels really nice in the hands, not too rough and not too smooth, just right.  And I particularly like the grip stripes on the bottom half of each side, as well as the snug fit.  I ordered the Swarm skin for the back, and the texture and look for that one is great, as well.  The pattern changes depending on what angle the light hits it, creating a pretty cool effect.
Protection-wise, I'd place it at a medium level of protection, with adequate top and bottom lips on the front, and the sides come up to within 0.5 to 1 mm from the screen level.  I have it paired with a screen protector, so I feel that my phone has decent protection coverage all around. 
Anyway, all-in-all a decent case and good purchase.
Edit:  fyi, the ring on the case in the photo is for use with Magsafe accessories

traded a note4 for s22 ultra 512 got $800 off that's some aggressive sales right there	I honestly thought the sales person was shitting me. The terms says $35 or more getting $800 off and the note4 is one of the phones. Honestly I would have kept my note 10 plus and not switched to the s22 ultra but I can't pass up that deal.	N
help can't choose a s22 or flip4	"I can get a s22 with 200 off at TMobile them selfs 
https://imgur.com/gallery/RkB7bOb
While best buy I can get the s22  for 22 a month with 115 in trade in and 200 instant credit 
Idk which I should do
But the thing is I can get the fold for 500 off the phone and 10 trade in on the same.6s for 22 a month as well but that's Thu a TMobile deal not best buy  that's the one I was going towards as it's newer even tho the camera not as good as a s22 .. but then s22 is conventional to go towards since the other has to flip
Backstory
I ordered like 2 weeks ago Thursday it shipped the 9th it never left there ware house even tho there systems said otherwise they had to investigate that and found it in there warehouse not sent out yet
I have bought the case for the fold 4 already. For s22 I'll have to buy the case for it then"	N

should I upgrade my s10 to an s21 or s22? Explanation below	"The battery life of my s10 is really terrible now and after over 2 years of usage, I'm thinking of upgrading it and also because Android 12 is gonna be the last update, that's why I've decided to change the phone instead of just changing the battery. Initially I wanted to buy the s21 because it's cheaper than the s22 but now I'm thinking of getting the s22 because the s21 is gonna be 2 years old in few couple months, but the price difference between the s21 and s22 is $150 but both phones are very similar. Is it worth it to buy the s22 or I should just get the s21 instead? I plan on using whichever phone I get for a minimum of 3 years hopefully. Some might advise to wait for the s23 but when that comes out, I won't be able to afford it because it will be very expensive in my country

Galaxy S22 battery: how is this possible?	"I'm right now at 68%, starting from 100% with 1 hour SOT, and 4.26 hrs in idle and I did literally NOTHING.
The most used app is the Clock which I used as timer while cooking and it got 1.8%...
If I sum up all the apps that have consumed my battery so far, according to the Battery Usage in the Settings, I don't even reach 10% of total usage...
And 1 hour SOT for a 10% of battery would be pretty normal...if I end up at 90/89%...I would be very satisfied.
I have several apps in deep sleep, some other in sleep. Honestly more than I would but...ok...
I also disabled my second SIM card since it is from another country and I thought it could suck energy.
Where is that 22% of battery that I can't see in the Battery Usage?
I'd really like to optimize my battery but how can I if I don't see which app or service is sucking it up?
Moreover, in the very first days the battery seemed to be better. Could the adaptive algorithm messing up somehow?
(Writing this post, it dropped to 66%...)"	N

If I go slower, with my touch, I am able to move to the next app.

How is this wireless charger for S22, is it good enough?	"It seems my charging port will need repairing, so until then, i am going to charge wirelessly. I didn't want to break bank for a wireless charger. Saw this one for ~$26 bucks. Anyone else use it? I saw some others that were cheaper and higher W output, but they were store brand so i disnt feel comfoetable with them. 
Anker has a good reputation as a 3rd party charging accessory supplier don't they? Would habe preffered a stand but they didnt have any. So pad it is."	N

Power users guide to getting the most out of your battery and device	"As a frequent visitor of this sub I have gotten pretty tired all of these posts about battery life. Either people will post their screenshots of like 3 hour SOT with comments full of people cursing the day SmartSwitch was created, or it's people creating guides on how to completely cripple your device with power saving settings that you feel like you're using a moto z2 play just to end up with like 8 hour SOT
This phone is a 1000+ dollars, it's time to treat it like one. In this short guide I will (hopefully) show you how to reach a 12 hour SOT WITHOUT messing with any settings. Yes that means you can keep your screen resolution, your refresh rate, and yes even your processing speed.
All you need are 3 things (and some bonus optional stuff)
1. [Universal Android Debloater ](https://github.com/0x192/Universal-Android-Debloater) with all the big tech companies that put their grubby hands on your device there is bound to be TONS of garbage they leave behind. From Google, to Samsung, to your carrier, there is about 100-200 completely unessesary garbage applications (most are hidden) sitting on your device day one. Universal Android Debloater (UAD) removes it all. Simply follow the instructions (a computer is required) and it will automatically delete everything that is bloating your device and constantly phoning home.
There are some features that by default UAD will remove, but luckily you can manually tell it to keep programs like Google maps, edge panel, and Google lens. Notably for gamers this will also remove Game Optimization Service which needs to die or be fixed already.
2. [Greentooth](https://f-droid.org/repo/com.smilla.greentooth) this F-Droid application compared to the previous tip is pretty insignificant, but it does one small thing that GREATLY improves battery life (especially if you use wireless headphones)
All it does is if you are no longer using Bluetooth, it just turns it off automatically. I know crazy, but you would be surprised by how much battery Bluetooth roaming takes up while your device is just constantly looking for a device to connect to.
3. Last not not least. I know I already went on a deal about SmartSwitch, but if you are one of many who are plagued by its disease... Just bite the bullet and reset. I know it's a pain, but if you continue to wait to do it you are only delaying the inevitable so do it ASAP
BONUS TIPS: if you haven't already download [Good Guardians ](https://apps.samsung.com/appquery/appDetail.as?appId=com.android.samsung.utilityapp) almost every tool it provides is great for detecting bad behaving applications so you can remove them.
Also, I know I said no settings talk but one big thing is turning down or completely off Ram Plus. It utterly guts performance and its just a terribly implemented feature.
That's it, hope this helps some of you. If you have any questions feel free to ask."	N

Does cable affect Samsung Dex?	"I tried to plug my S22U into my monitor the other day (Aorus FV43U), using USB-C, and it shows me the error that Dex wasn't supported on my monitor. 
As far as I knew, there shouldn't be anything that stopped me from using Dex on this monitor. It has USB-C with display output (DisplayPort Alt mode I believe) and it works on my laptop as well. So I suspect that my cable (which is cheapo Samsung cable that came in the box) might be the reason that Dex won't start. 
Do you think that's likely the case? Want to hear some opinion before I've decided to go out and buy some cable just for this. Or is it needs to be HDMI in order for Dex to work? Is it also possible that some monitor isn't compatible despite having all the required hardware?"	N

Is Smart Switch really a problem for battery and performance? Before and after reset	"So, I was using OnePlus 7 pro from July 2019 to April 2022. That's when I shifted to S22 Ultra(SD) 256gb. Did Smart Switch and did set everything to max, except the 5G, as it is not available here, but yes, ram plus to 8 gb, 120hz, wqhd+ etc. With Adaptive battery and Adaptive power saving enabled as well. Later ram plus I did set it to 0gb but the battery was still shit. Eg. in the screenshot below
[Before Reset.](https://preview.redd.it/pljap8n0xbq91.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c695179e13b0ddff5165a88d114c5b9fc15aa3de)
How was the battery and performance?Battery - 5-6hours sot, if not gaming and the screen off drain being 2-3% every hour. Phone would last 15 hours max. And if you just watch content, it went up to 7 hours at best.Performance - Below 900 scores for geekbench single core and below 2800 for multi core.I think that was happening because it was heating a lot too, one crazy day, placed the phone on ice pack, temps went down to 10 degrees, could see some moisture condensing on the phone screen, as the ice pack was just under the phone on the other side, and the scores went up to 1200 and 3500. And I was in no mood to play using that. Sorry I don't have screenshots of that to show. But it did that.
Then I finally did reset my phone on 22nd sept., and now with everything set to max, without 5G, this is what I get.

Yes, I agree I am no expert on doing things, no body is. But so far, I love resetting it and starting from scratch. Phone feels smooth, no stutters.

I will update you guys on how it goes after that, and would definitely tell you more about it. Listing the settings soon too.
Performance is set to high as well.

S22U vs N20U (2 months in)	"Alright guys,
Pro samsung products and supporter of DEX development.
Here is my take on the s22U vs an N20U.
Its crazy, but I feel that things are snappier on my Note 20 U, however I have DEV mode on, and all the transition speeds are set to 0.
Performance test via Dex. Note 20U: (newest software build, US version)
I use OPEN VPN + TEAMVIEWER + RD CLIENT + MS TEAMS constantly on my N20U, heavily. I access Windows Environments, and Linux.
I would hit 10GB/12GB on the RAM, and will need to clear it from time to time. Using a Docking Station, to enable DEX,  It sits up right (SkullCO) and it does heat up, but normally.
With this set up, I also have Dual Sim, and both NETWORK is constantly accessing 5g/LTE. Also have 3 simultaneous Bluetooth Connections: Keyboard, Headset, Mouse.
This set up is worked on for 8-10 hours a day. I am connected to a pretty large screen and Im able to get 1080, 1200, 1440 from Dex using my docking stations (alternative), have not used Samsung's dock.
To me, this is actually pushing it on the phone, but Im one of the few that actually maxes out the resources of the phone. (ram plus enabled and FAST DATA search is on)
With OPENVPN + TEAMVIEWER + RD CLIENT + MS TEAMS, all peripherals, web browsers on the background, youtube app open, I would max out of resources where:
I would need to force close all apps and run them again, my issue though could be an ANDROID limit with the CALL to RAM-situation. However when its running, its smooth, and Im able to do work.
Often times, my bluetooth connections would lag out, music will stutter, mouse and keyboard stroke would be delayed.. then Id have to wait for things to catch up. Again, I think Im one of the few that actually maxes out resources..
With the constant clear of apps, and maybe a reseat to the dock station, my issues are resolved.
Performance test via Dex, S22U:  (software build is before 9/22 release)
Hardware is newer or they say it is, but we will see on how it crunches:
Same situation, OPENVPN + TEAMVIEWER + RD CLIENT + MS TEAMS, paired with  3 bluetooth connections, DEV is not enabled, all animations are stock speed, fast data search and ram plus.
Immedietly I notice a hang, RD CLIENT hung. Closed everything, and launched  my apps again. 
Every 10-20 minutes my Bluetooth would lag out, I researched the chip inside the s22, and its just a .1 revision vs the Note, so they gotta be using the same chips for the wireless portion. 
Then I would notice extreme lags when launching all 3 apps: OpenVPN + TEAMVIEWER + RD CLIENT, something that isnt visible in the Note 20U. (this maybe a software update fix)
Then used stadia app, just for giggles and I wanted to see how it handled playing cloud games.
To my suprise, the app is much cleaner, quicker on the S22U over dex vs N20U, so maybe there are some new optimization.
I undocked my phone after 3-4 hours of work, and boy the phone is warmer than the N20u. Hmm..(both phones are US version, however the S22 still has August or July patch, so maybe theres something there)
Outside of DEX: immediete things to notice:
BRIGHTER screen, smaller, more in-tact.
120HZ at full WQHD is nice, but noticable? only if you bring your eyes as close to the screen as possible.
Battery: Maybe because S22 is newer, it lasted 2 hours 27 minutes longer, both doing the same task.
S22 heats up more than N20, but I think this can be solved by a software update.
S-PEN - didnt think Id say this, but I notice the speed difference vs the N20. Also, the S22U pen, feels more ergonomic than the N20u pen.
Camera - I really think Samsung is software-optimizing the images produced from the S22+. I am NOT a photographer or Graphic designer, I am a Network Administrator, and I could care less about the photos. BUT I firmly believe they are on the same level with S22+ enhancing it
UFS 3.1 can you tell the difference? I can using USB ON THE GO adapter, I transfer FILES, sometimes I grab ISO's from my network, and drop them on my phone locally then transfer it to a USB stick. 
a 3.8 GB finished 13 secs quicker transfering to a Sandisk 3.0 Stick.
OneU1 - waiting for 5.0
Summary:
I REALLY FEEL that the S22 is a gimmick, and you will not notice anything quicker on the S22 unless you do what I do and actually use all resources.
I really felt that my N20u was quicker, and did not heat up like the S22+, however, do I recommend this phone for an upgrade:
YES, stop being a horder, upgrade! 
Because this is a newer model in which will probably get 2-3 feature updates, I will recommend this on that aspect. Note20U will be caput after 13 update, and will not get anything more for sure, IDC what other samsung fanboys will say, but N20U stops at 13.
Performance wise- If you are basing your need to upgrade solely to the functionality of the N20u, I would say hold. I did not get any delays or the S22 was not that much faster than the N20.
I will update my S22 to the newest patch to see if that improves the phone!
to the people that wants to switch from the N20u to the S22u, hope this helps"	N

GPS Navigation and Power Saver	Not really sure if I have a One UI 5 beta issue, or phone always worked this way, since it‚Äôs not something I do all that often.

The plan is ultimately to get a clear case and make small prints to swap out for the S23 and I am hearing the 23 and 22 will have the same dimensions. Also not sure if im gonna go for the plus or ultra so trying to plan this out way in advance for both phones

SIM Unlock S22 from $800 trade-in	"Back about March 2022 I did that trade-in deal where you turn in any Galaxy phone and get an $800 credit on a Galaxy S22 for $800.
While this effectively allowed me to ""upgrade"" for ""free"", what wasn't so explicitly stated was how it would be ""paid off"" over 36 installments. So over the past few months, my monthly bill would show an additional charge of $22.23 which would be covered out of that $800 credit at no extra cost out of my pocket.
Fast-forward to now, I would like to get this S22 SIM unlocked. As per ATT rules, you can't unlock any phone that hasn't been paid off. So while the phone hasn't been ""paid off"" because the installments haven't finished, it has been credited in full and I don't owe ATT anything out of my pocket.
I haven't spoken to customer service yet as I'm still confused if I'm in the right or not. The 'Get info about device unlock eligibility' page says under 'Manage Your Device' that my S22 is 'Good To Go', yet when I go through the device unlock process, it is immediately denied and states 'Your unlock request was denied because all of the installment payments for this device have not been paid.'
Can anyone clue me in if I should be able to unlock it or am I basically stuck till 2025 even though I don't owe anything?"	N
5g gateway consistently sucks, how about my s22 ultra?

Notification reminder is off, the whole phone is silent, all the apps are updated, NiceCatch catches NOTHING. I've reset the network, reset everything. The only way it does not vibrate is in safe mode and I can't live like that.  Please help me"	N
Just wanted to share my screen settings for anyone who was dealing with the new screen and feeling colours were a little washed out. These have saved me from returning the phone. (Moving from an S20+ 5G)		N
Found the bug - improved performance!!	"Since I have had my 22U (US Snap) I have been plagued by constant lag, bugginess and sluggish performance that has been driving me crazy that I never had on any other Android.  I have reset the phone 2 times and optimized apps every  month and it had pissed me off to the point where I actually started to consider apple since the top of the line Android has been disappointing.
I realized that the official Weather Channel App had been going crazy and acting up for  a while (but not as long as the phone was acting up) so I decided to delete it and suddenly its been a whole new phone.  Better performance, no freezing, better battery and everything for a week now when I would maybe get 1-2 days of good performance before this .
If your phone is still running sluggish and buggy delete the weather channel asap"	N
Camera/System Lag + Battery Life Fixed! (SD)	"I know the title shows some big claims considering these are issues that have plagued a lot of users with this phone, but I am 7 days into some big changes!  
Ever since getting this phone 4 months ago, I have loved this phone...except the camera lagged a lot, as did the phone in general at random times, and the battery life was worse than my Fold 3. I had heard people talking about how Smart Switch was a potential cause, but it is obviously convenient.  
I was using the One UI 5 beta, but I had to ditch it because of apps that I like not supporting the update so I had to wipe my phone to downgrade, and I decided that I would try not using Smart Switch (other than transferring calls/messages)  and see if it really did change anything.  
Well a week has passed and I have fallen in love with this phone in a way I never could after trading in my Fold 3. The camera has been perfect and my SOT went from 3h to 7-8 depending on the day. I still have some weird system lag once in a while, but it was while I was doing a lot at once.  
I am not saying it will work for everyone, but I would do it again in a heartbeat, and these were the things keeping me from saying I loved this phone."	N

S22 Ultra Exynos overheat	"Hello people!
I think I'm kinda in need of your help. I bought my s22 ultra exynos version like 1 week ago and I'm not sure if whats happening means my phone is overheating.
The top half of my phone gets hot from crazy little things like watching streams for 20 minutes. I wouldn't say it's hot like super hot but significantly warmer and it makes me kinda uneasy. Also, I'm not a big phone gamer but I tried some games out. I'm a chess player so I immediately downloaded the chess.com app and played for 10-20minutes and I thought my phone will explode, which is super crazy because its a simple 2D game. The top half of the phone was kinda burning hot. Hot enough to make my hands sweat. I figured the app might not be optimised well for my phone or whatever, so I deleted it. I also play an idle game, prolly around 20 minutes a day and the heat with that game is acceptable. Not high just barely noticable. (Significantly better visuals than the chess.com app)
I was worried and ran a 20 minute benchmark thingy which said my phone heat was okay but it only commented on my battery heat and if i'm not mistakin the top half is not where my battery is.
Please note: Yes, I was aware of the rumours about exynos overheat and yes I did research before I bought the phone, I just thought even if these heat problems are real they wouldn't come out while watching simple videos and streams and while playing simple games.
(My screen settings are 2k res and adaptive framerate btw)
So my question really is, how do I know if whats happening is overheating? I might overreact so thats why I need help. Do your phones get warmer even after 20 minutes of watching videos?
Thanks for any help!
Edit: forgot to say I'm not a case user, prolly should change that (?)"	N

Would a replacement back affect photo quality?	"Hi all,
My s22u has a cracked back, so I was looking to replace it
Found some cheap replacements on aliexpress, and noticed that it also comes with the camera lens glass

My question is, is that just regular glass on the original part of the s22u, if replaced, would it cause any quality difference in photos?

S22 Battery Life (Exynos)	"Hello, so I've had my S22 (Exynos) for about 6 months now, and the battery life is not good, like at all. 
So I just wanted to check with the rest of you if you're having the same issue as me where you constantly feel like you have to actively think about how you use your phone on a daily basis because if you don't it won't last all day. 
I'm using today as an example from my daily life because this is how it usually is and and how it will be, and today I came home from work with about 20% left and only 2h41m sOt, which I feel is exceptionally bad. So I've been thinking if it's maybe just my device that does this or if its just the way it is with Samsung flagship devices nowadays. And another thing, i have adaptive power saving ON and it turned on today at about 62% so for most of the day I've had power saving mode on. Any thoughts or comments at all is greatly appreciated."

Super Fast Charging Gone After August Update And Still Not Returning	"WTH Samsung!

I understand if it's proprietary standard like SuperVOOC or VOOC from Oppo or Hypercharge from Xiaomi. Even third party SuperVOOC charger is available in my country. Samsung uses PD PPS standard which is, based on my understanding, not proprietary.
I've been using Samsung for years but if by the next update SFC does not return, the next phone I buy will be iPhone.

12 to 13 Days now since my return	"It's been about 12 or 13 days since I switched from the 13 pro max to this S22 Ultra and my experience has been mixed. 
The S22 Ultra is doing what I want it to do and that is multitasking. Having 2 apps in split screen mode while having the map float around, the link to windows, controlling the tv through smart things is all great "" but it's not consistent"". 
Im very happy that app crashing isn't as bad as it was on the Note 20 ultra I once owned but apps loading is far worse here and that's on 5G mobile data and WiFi. The lag that happens sometimes when switching between apps is really bad. Combining those 2 things together just makes me beg the phone to work faster and not crash. 
Super fast charge and buying the phone battery case has helped with my battery but I just shouldn't have to abuse a 5000mah battery this much to get through a day 
I want to love this phone so much more as it really does have the elements of a fantastic device it's just the most important thing is something that it struggles with and that's ""consistency"""	N

How to force local/national roaming switching	"Hey! Is there a way to make s22u more aggresively/quickly use local/national roaming and switch to other network based on poor reception? 
I work in a place where on my private sim card I have a very, very poor reception, usually 1 bar when the phone is on the side of my desk, by the window, sometimes even 0 bars. When I go to the kitchen or to the conference room I get 0 bars and internet connection drops, problems during phone calls. The 2nd problem is elheavy battery drain. And the 3rd problem is the fact that it's hard to stream music when it drops internet connection randomly, even with 1bar on my desk.
Sometimes when I go to the conference room, far from the window and any traces of reception, and when I stay there for a while, phone eventually switches to local roaming/different network (from Play to Orange) and then I get 4-5 bars, but it's very rare, takes so, so much time and I wonder if there's a way to make it faster?"

Hoping someone has a solution for an issue I'm having that not even Samsung has been able to figure out.
Bluetooth on my S22 Ultra feels broken.  All my Samsung products pair perfectly like my buds pro 2 and Galaxy Watch 5 but nothing else does if it requires an app.

1.) Sony Headphones app for my WX4, will never find the headphones, I can manually connect to them but the app never sees them so I can't adjust anything.
2.) Bose connect app for my sunglasses and Sound Link Speaker, the app never finds it and I have to connect manually but like the Sony app even after connecting manually the app never sees it
3.) Wyze App, my Wyze scale uses Bluetooth to connect and again it must go through the app.  The scale if I try to connect manually tells me an app is required (phone tells me) so I haven't been able to use the scale on my phone and have resorted to using my iPad
4.) Govee App, my Bluetooth smart lights can't be controlled or connected to on my Samsung phone, iPad connects fine and so does my old Pixel but not my Samsung. 
5.) Sena App for my bicycle helmet for Bluetooth connectivity, the app never sees the helmet and even using manual connect it doesn't work.  My wife also has the same helmet and her Flip 4 can't connect either.
6.) Nissan connect for my car same deal as all the others the app never can connect or see the car in pairing mode.  iPad and old Pixel connect right away.
7.) Alexa Auto for my car, same story as the rest of the apps.
So in summary no Bluetooth device that requires an app will connect via the app or be visible.
Steps tied.
1.) Factory Reset with restore from Samsung Cloud.
2.) Factory Reset fresh, no restore and hours of work getting things back up.
3.) Clearing a network settings and Bluetooth devices.
4.) Sending the phone to Samsung support who determined nothing was wrong with the phone via diagnostics.
I am on the latest software build and I'm out of ideas.  The Samsung support forms are full of people like me with this problem but also many others who say their decide works great.
It's annoying me so much that I'm thinking about giving up this great phone and going to a different vendor.

Is the S22 worth getting?	Currently I have the A20 and have been looking into a upgrade. The S22 seems perfect for me because I prefer smaller phones and like the design. I have also been debating with the Z Flip 4 but I'm not sure about the durability.	N
Pixel density of the S22+ vs the S10+?	i'm looking to upgrade from the s10+ to the s10+. but there's quite a bit of difference in the pixel density. 522 vs 393. I've not been keeping up. was there a discussion around this when samsung decided to lower the resolution on their plus phones? which gen did it start at? is there going to be a noticeable difference, especially for youtube? My eyes aren't great to begin with, high myopia+astig, hence why i'm not considering the s22 non-plus (which would have a better pixel density)	N

Unlock Galaxy S22 bought from Samsung with T Mobile software	"I bought from another guy who said it was bought from Samsung directly but didn't get a receipt from original purchase. Phones was sealed and working fine, gets all software upgrades etc. Contacted today T mobile and they said phone wasn't sold by them and they can't unlock it: 
"" That is actually not going to be a device sold by TMOBILE. I certainly apologize for the confusion! 
Device Samsung - Galaxy S22
IMEI 359xxxxxxxxxxx
MSISDN Sold By Unknown
Unlock Status Locked
Eligibility cannot be determined for devices sold by other sources""
I'm trying to recontact the seller from OfferUp to get the receipt and eventually call Samsung directly but I've seen so many posts on the internet saying they got ping ponged from Samsung to T Mobile.
Is there a way to unlock it without having the receipt?
Is there a rule that these phones can be unlocked automatically after a period of time?
I want to travel overseas and use another sim card that's why I want it unlocked.
Thanks in advance"	N
Is Samsung Galaxy S22 any good?	"Hey guys. The title basically speaks for itself. I was thinking of finally changing my 4-year-old Galaxy S9 for something new. I've initially been thinking of getting myself S21, but it seems to be out of stock everywhere. This brings me to considering getting S22, and I was wondering if anyone could share their user experience. 
I was also thinking of getting Pixel 6, but apparently it's gotten quite laggy and glitchy (at least according to some of the YouTube videos I've seen). S21 FE was also a smartphone I considered, but it's a bit too big to my liking, and as far as I know it's got a worse camera than original S21.
P.S. Just so you know, I'll only be able to get an Exynos version. I'm not aware of the current state of those chips, but from what I know, Snapdragon used to be better."	N

S22 Exynos 40% Battery drain OVERNIGHT - Possible culprit found	"Last night I took my S22 Exynos out of charging before I went to sleep. I woke up in the morning to find 40% of my battery DRAINED. 
I'm really frustrated with this S22 as idle battery drain in general with screen off according to Accubattery is 5% PER HOUR. My S22 does not enter deep sleep overnight or during the day. 
I opened ADB and looked and noticed a LOT of screen wakeups when I was sleeping and the phone was not charging.

My first week with the s22 Ultra	"Hello, long time iPhone guy here. My last Android was the S7, and since I wasn't embedded in the apple ecosystem I thought I'd try to change it up a little.
First thing, I wanted the s22 Ultra and didn't care to wait for the s23 series. Seeing as how Samsung supports their phones the longest out of all the android manufacturers, I feel like buying a Samsung premium phone right now is a good choice since 4 years OS and 5 years security is great.
I had a iPhone 13 pro max, which is known as a beast of a phone. The differences between the two aren't as many as I thought. My only really big thing I miss is using face ID to log into my bank, but that's a nitpick. I'm now used to using my fingerprint to log on and in apps and it took just like 3 days. Some of the apps actually work better (cough, Pandora).
Fast charging is really useful, I don't use Super fast charging but fast charging is plenty fast enough for me. My iPhone took like an hour for 15% charge. Also USB C is more convenient and cheaper than Apple's stupid lightning connector.
The main thing I see people talk about is the battery. Yes, the iPhone has a better battery. But the s22 Ultra doesn't have a bad battery plus it charges fast, I can easily last the day and some on one charge. I unplug in the morning, do some Duolingo, browse the internet, listen to streaming music in the gym (Sirius xm/Pandora for a hour and thirty minutes), make calls, and play games for around 20 minutes. That takes less than 15% battery when I'm done.
&amp;#x200B;
TLDR: I'm using the phone the same as my iPhone and see no reason to go back to an apple device. The customization of this device is amazing, the features are outstanding and I'm still learning, the battery life is great, and the fact that Samsung has those insane trade in deals for future purchases. I love this phone."	N

Internal photo editor ruins quality?	"Hi,  
I've noticed recently something, if I take a photo with the phone and zoom in after I see a lot of details and all god.  
Then for example I press edit just to let's say remove a person in the image or a shadow, once I do that and save the image if I zoom again I see the quality is worse and less details (not the are where I remove a person, the whole image).  
Is it something happened as a bug on the latest update and soon to be fixed hopefully? or is this the limit always of that editor? I usually edit with Lightroom which doesn't lower the quality but the shadow/people remove in the stock editor is awesome!"	N

From iPhone 12 Pro Max to S22 Ultra - 2 Days In	"As the title says, I've had this phone for 2 whole days now coming from the Apple ecosystem and so far I'm thoroughly enjoying the experience. I've switched almost entirely to Samsung's ecosystem with a Watch 4 Classic (gotta love that stupid clicky bezel lol) and I've been enjoying the Buds 2 for a month or so coming from some infuriating Sony headphones (""stop connecting to my phone from the case!"")
A large reason behind the switch is because of the host of features this phone has, the S pen is surprisingly more useful than I thought, especially the remote shutter function which I predict will be greatly utilized at work. Plus being able to use multiple windows at once is amazing. I haven't messed with Dex yet, but I think I'll get a lot of use out of that too. 
I do have some questions that some of you longer time users might be able to answer. Is there a way for the auto correct to function a little more like the iOS? Specifically so it can auto capitalize and automatically do contractions such as ""I'll"" or ""don't"" without needing to select it from the suggestion bar. Or even add a space after completing words. 
Also, if any of you wonderful people have MagBak case, do you know if MagSafe phone grips are compatible with the case? I'm looking at the GripMini from RhinoShield to fill the Popsocket hole in my life. If not, they seem cheap enough that I'll be the guinea pig here and let everyone know. I know their website says it's MagSafe compatible but I'm not sure if that includes accessories or just the MagSafe charging feature. 
Anyway, having a blast so far. If there's any other must-haves or must-knows any of think I need, I'd love to hear about them.

Trade in money and glass type	So I've looked around but all the other trade in questions seem to ask about the condition of the trade in device such as scratches and cracks. My question is about the amount of money you receive. When trading in is it a simple yes or no? As in let's say your phone is worth up to $1000 and you trade it in. If it is determined to be within the requirements do they just give you $1000 and if not only $25? Or after inspection is it a take it or leave it kinda situation where when (excepted but not to their liking) they come up with some random value like $625 final offer? My phone has a lot of micro scratches but they are only noticeable under a lamp at specific angles. I'm mostly wondering for when the s23 ultra roles around. I just bought a screen protector so there shouldn't be a problem with the screen getting any more micro scratches going forward. Side note, I baby the phone but it seems to get the micro scratches (not deep scratches mind you) really easy. Is this because of the new glass type? Thanks	N
Have you ever wondered about the reason why people are having issues?	"How many people actually have a factory unlocked and ""clean"" phone with lag and battery problems? 
I can't help think, what if its the buggy phone carrier firmware like Verizon. Thats 3 layers of potential bugs. First Google modifications,  then Samsung and then tweaked again by some underpaid phone company worker.
Then there's the people who just restore from Google drive or use smart switch. Sure thats what it is there for but maybe just maybe you are bringing over problems or errors in the transfer that can cause battery drain.
Then there's the people who use different launchers over the OS or run stuff like good lock on top and then run into problems with lag and stuttering.
Sure the snapdragon 8 gen 1 is not efficient but i can't imagine thats its the ONLY reason for the problems. That doesn't make sense to me.
Maybe i am 100% in the wrong. All i can say is that with my factory unlocked s22U with stock Samsung settings i have no problems."	N

S22U is the best phone I have ever owned!	"One month user.
I have owned my fair share of phones throughout the past 15 years, from Nokia 2100, Motorola razr v3, Sony Ericsson, iPhone and the recent 3-4 years I switched to Samsung with the S series, and the S22U my absolute favorite that I feel that I WANT to keep it for many years.
The Pen, the battery (at least for me), the screen, camera etc..
My only problem initially was the design, even though it was rated as a top-notch design by many people, plus the square bulky frame.
However, it grew on me a lot, and I love the curved screen.
I just wanted to share my experience"	N
anyone know what this new volume bar is? it will overide the main audio control if set to mute.		N
S22 Ultra Case that passes S-Pen Test with Tempered Glass?	I'm on the hunt for a case that passes the S-Pen test (test where you lay the S-Pen across the screen and it should not be touching the screen, should only touch the case edges). I have an Otterbox Defender case, and while it's a great case (barring the fact that while wireless charging works... it can be spotty), with my Tempered Glass protector (amFilm), the S-Pen is gliding on the screen when I lay it across (meaning it touches the glass before the case), if it does this on the Defender, I wouldn't expect more than that from Otterbox React/Commuter/etc... I wanted to hear some suggestions. I seen some videos of even the Supcase Unicorn Beetle, and I don't think this would pass the S-Pen test, especially with a screen protector on (Would like to hear from someone that has it). Some interesting prospects I'm currently looking at are an Encased X Armor and Encased Rebel.. again not sure if they'll fit the bill. Ideally I also would prefer a case with a camera slide protector as well or at least individual camera cutouts that pass the S-Pen Test but I have a feeling I'm asking too much there. Other interesting ones I've heard about are the Caseborne V... but again I'm not sure it would pass the S-Pen Test WITH Tempered Glass on. I also looked at Spigen cases but I don't think any of them are close to what I'm looking for.. Looking forward to everyone's input!	N
I got a replacement...	And the same issue I had with my previous 22U, going into camera mode and it freezing and being unable to be used. Luckily I got it fixed. I'm almost 100% sure it's a software issue. It's only when I go into the .6x that it lags and eventually stops working. SAMSUNG, FIX PLEASE.	N
Video Sizes	"Generally the videos on the internet have certain aspect ratios (16:9) and samsung phones are generally taller than the actual video so there are black bars on the sides. What I am confused by is even though s22 ultra has a bigger display than s22 plus the width of the phones are similar. So does the videos played in them have same (or close) size ?

Big Difference In Performance in 8gb Ram and 12gb Ram Version?	"Best Buy has an incredibly good promo right now. S22 Ultra 128gb Unlocked model is $899.99 with activation on any carrier. I have ATT Elite with the signature discount, so I get free activations. They will also give me $900 for my old S21 Ultra or my old iPhone 12 Pro, so essentially making the phone free. Most all stores have the 8gb Ram 128gb storage model in stock ( the $899.99), so I could walk in and out with a free upgrade  ( excluding taxes ), or I could order the 12gb Ram /256gb storage option for pickup in a week.
I already have a 12gb Ram version on Verizon...will I notice any performance differences going with the 8gb option. I'm quite happy with my 12gb model, it doesn't lag etc, just wondering if the $100 is worth it.
Thanks"	N

Samsung Galaxy A53 5G vs Samsung Galaxy S22 5G	" 
Hi guys, I cant decide which Samsung model to buy so I hope someone can help me a bit. I'm deciding between A53 and S22.
These are the prices in my county:
A53 - 310$ or 320‚Ç¨
S22 - 649Àò$ or 664‚Ç¨
A53 is twice as cheap as S22, and has larger battery (A53: 5000mAh vs S22: 3700mAh). One of my concerns is the lag that always comes to an Android after some time of using it. I know that S22 series are definitely better with performances. My issue is that I do not like these bigger phones and S22 has 6.1"" screen which is a big plus for me, while A53 has 6.5"" screen. I also love the physical design of S22, but it's not so important because it would be in protective mask. Also my next concern is the small battery in S22. 3700mAh just sounds too bad for a phone which costs around 650‚Ç¨ and it is the only reason why am I considering A53 model.
I would like to buy a phone that I will use for the next 4 years. I basically use my phone to read, go online now and then, listen to music and to take photos.
The money difference isn't that much of a problem if the S22 is really worth that money."	N
S22Plus stutter after Beta 3 (Exynos)	"Hi all,  
I installed beta 3 on my S22Plus (Exynos) and wiped cache partition.   
Everything works fine except the phone is overall very laggy, sometime takes time to register my finger at the begining of a scroll, some animations are just skipped (when I dismiss a notification, scroll on home screen, open an image in the gallery, ...)  
I tried restarting the phone but it's still the same.  
I have the feeling that it happens when the screen goes from 24Hz to 120Hz but I'm really not sure.  
Is anyone else having the same issue ?"	N
S22 battery life improvement	"I bought s22 plus 2 weeks back . I used dual sim esim+sim since start. The max sot I used to get was 5hr with 18 hrs off screen time. And always charged to 85% only and never went below 20%.Just yesterday i decided to test battery life at full capacity.   I drained phone to 8% , disabled esim,only physical sim active and charged phone to 100% for the first time. Now suddenly my battery life is better. I don't know what made such huge difference. But its first time since purchase that i m satisfied with battery life. Hope its permanent improvement and not temporary. 
Power saving is on, Bluetooth &amp; location off,60hz, whole time on wifi, brightness to 30%.

Should I upgrade from an S10 to an S22/S22+?	"My current S10 is starting to feel a little old. The camera has a little shadow glitch thing on one side and it doesn't focus well at all. The battery is slowly starting to drain faster as well. I do use the camera semi-professionally (mostly photos, but also videos) but do not need something crazy good, just better. Would the S22 or S22+ be a good fit for me?
With a trade in I could get the S22 256GB for $550 or the S22+ 256GB for $650, which seems like a good deal to me. It's hard to pick out a good, affordable phone these days. And I don't really feel like getting an iPhone, because I feel like I have more freedom with android.
To me it seems worth it, but I just wanted to get other opinions on this."	N
General Question	I recently upgraded to the S22+ and all day today I've had security/software update 4, 5 and 6 in a row and now it's telling me there's another "software update 7" 20 mins later. Was it maybe because the phone was sitting in a box for a long period before I bought it and turned it on, needing updates overtime, or something else?	N
Mac charger for new s22+	"Is it okay to charge newly bought s22 plus with Mac charger ? Don't want to spend extra bucks as I have plenty type C charger lying around ( coming from one plus ) .

Samsung Pay is useless without MST	"I was at Home Depot the other day and didn't have my card with me. Nbd, I'll use Samsung Pay.
The cashier sees me pull out my phone: ""We don't have that.""
Me: ""Oh, my phone works anywhere."" I touch the phone to the terminal and it's not working. Weird. ""Let me try again.""
Cashier: ...
Me: Embarrassed and panicked because I don't have any money on me. The line behind me grows impatient. ""I don't know what happened, I'll come back later.""
A quick Google search tells me that Galaxy S22U doesn't have MST. What! I find it ridiculous that Samsung would remove such a useful feature. That was Samsung Pay's main selling point over Google Pay and Apple Pay. They would even run commercials advertising it.

S22 Pink Pixel + Screen Burn-In + Flickering	"(Sorry if this has been posted / discussed before but I could only find related threads to S22+ and S22U.) 
My S22 was delivered early last month (September 2022), and yesterday after using Google Maps as SatNav for a few hours, that night I've noticed one pink pixel as well as screen burn-in. The burn-in resembles the Google Maps app in navigation mode (circles on the upper left side), noticable mostly when a dark background is up. 
There's also now some sort of flickering, it's faint but noticeable when using the phone in the dark and if a large part of the screen is in dark grey (such as when opening the Reddit app in dark mode).
Needless to say I'm very disappointed in this experience. I've had a S10 for 3 years, used exact same way but a camera focus issue got worse and worse and eventually I went for the upgrade. I'm based in the UK.
I feel that Samsung support may dismiss the burn-in and flickering isses as they are most noticeable hiring the night. But does anyone know if I'd be able to claim warranty repairs at all, even if based on the one pink pixel? Thank you."	N

10h SOT...	"I recently sold my **iPhone 12PM** and bought my self a **S22U**.
At first glance, the device was the most amazing thing ever, the display is an **absolute eye candy**... Androids freedom to do what ever you want, customize it the way you want and just having that feeling of actually **OWNING** the device, was everything I wanted.
On the second day with the S22 I noticed that battery life was utter garbage, 4h SOT at max, I waited for two more days hopping it would get better, and it was still shit.
Browsing through reddit, I was looking for a way to increase my battery life and came across a lot of tutorial, most of the tutorials would just tell me to gut my device and disable everything. 
But, since I wanted more battery for my day to day use, I just followed a guide and managed to go from 4h to [7h SOT](https://ibb.co/92QX6pH).
7h is... ok? But I wanted more, I would get 8 to 9 on my 12PM that I owned since it released... 
So I kept searching, this time I came across a post that the guy suggested to debloat the device, but that was out of the question for me, since I like to have all the features samsung offers, and I already had compromised some of them by turning off in the settings.
And again I came across a video that explained how bad the [Snapdragon 8 Gen 1](https://youtu.be/7uXe1TtTaQw) actually is, and how it would destroy battery life on the devices... Also, even tho the GPU offers good performance, it drain battery like crazy.
And I had read somewhere that the refresh rate of the displays are controlled by the GPU... *No wonder my phone would get warm on regular use.*
Yesterday I decided to turn the features I had disabled back **on** and lower the displays refresh rate from 120hz to 60hz, and let me tell you, the difference on battery life and phone temperature is night and day, I have everything I need toggled **on** and the only compromise I had to make is lower the refresh rate, which for me is not a problem at all.
And I finally managed to get this amazing screen on time [10h SOT](https://ibb.co/rHMPXqF). I'm sure I could get more by turning some settings off, but the way it is now is just perfect. 9-10h SOT is just perfect to get me through any day.
I hope this post helps you guy's out there that are having awful battery life and just not being able to enjoy your device."	N
phone sized secondary display	Not sure if this is the right place to ask, but here goes. With folding phones becoming more popular, are there any products on the horizon for turning regular phones into "folding" phones by just plugging in an external phone sized display? Personally I feel like I wouldn't love to be locked into the form factor of a z fold or surface duo, so the ability to just unplug a second display would be awesome	N
Hot-take - using power saver mode on base S22 to get better battery isn't a compromise for most users	"https://ibb.co/HXsrzt2 
Used power saver with all features turned on EXCEPT decrease brightness by 10% and limiting apps/home screen.
10 hour SoT (extrapolating to 100% usage).
Home on wifi all day with 50% brightness during daytime, 30% in evening, then 10-15% at night. 
Mainly chrome and youtube, no gaming or camera usage.
Idle overnight with wifi turned off. 
Yes you miss the smoothness of 120hz but you gradually get used to 60hz again, and I say this as someone who has a 144hz PC monitor.
5G doesn't provide enough of a boost over 4g for me to justify using it, and I don't notice the 30% CPU loss as I don't game on phone. 
Many will say ""I paid full flagship price, I'm using all the features I can get"" regarding 120hz, then continue complaining about the battery. Have you considered how iphone 13 and 14 (non-pro models which are closer in price to s22 base) still use 60hz and have excellent battery? Yes their chipset is also better optimised but that's not a quick easy fix for android.
The 120hz is equivalent to the 1440p back when galaxy s8 came out, in that it was a nice feature but turned off by many due to the battery consumption."	N
HELP! S22 Exynos 40% Battery drain OVERNIGHT - Possible culprit found	" 
Last night I took my S22 Exynos out of charging before I went to sleep. I woke up in the morning to find 40% of my battery DRAINED.

I poked the SIM ejector into both holes...	"So... coming from the S10, I had stupidly assumed that the SIM tray on the S22 would also be at the top of the phone, so I poked it.

After that, I flipped the phone around and decided to poke the *other* hole in the bottom of the phone! 
I know this is a (somewhat) common mistake, but I just wanted to make sure that no damage to the water resistance can come from this. Particularly in the top hole as I haven't seen that one spoken about as much.

I'm considering the base S22, but it sounds like the battery on that is even hotter garbage than the S22 Ultra (which I thought was pretty bad considering I am a 'light' user).
What's the best alternative to the S22? I really want a phone around that exact physical size, as I feel that it's the perfect size for one handed usage. It's sad that there's no true 'flagship' at that size."	N
5UW on unlocked S22?	"I have an unlocked Galaxy S22 that I just put a VZW 5G SIM in.  I'm on the 5G Do More plan. I expected to see the 5UW in the notifications bar, but I haven't seen it.  I was in Orlando a few days ago, where VZW is suppose to have C-Band, but I never saw it.  I haven't seen 5UW anywhere I've been.
Is the unlocked version of the S22 missing N77 C-Band?  Could I possible be connected, when available, and it just not show because it's an unlocked version?
Thanks!"	N
Help with switching S22+ To Verizon eSIM	So, I had this S22+ On T-Mobile.. It's paid off, unlocked, and currently has a working physical verizon sim card inside. For some reason, it's still showing the T-Mobile logo on startup. And Verizon reps are seemingly unable to activate as eSIM because of this. It's on the Beta OneUI 5 software, if that makes a difference. Any questions, please reach out. All help appreciated.	N

How's your battery life on the S22 Ultra? Mine is 7h47m SoT from 100% to 0%. WQHD+, 120Hz. Mostly browsing and watching videos.	"[Here's a picture of my battery life](https://i.imgur.com/Fq3EyTs.jpg) from a full charge to 0%. 7h47m screen-on time and 13h8m total with screen off. 
My usage was just browsing all day and watching videos. Have my settings on WQHD+, 120Hz, and optimized processing speed. Nothing else different than defaults. This is on a Snapdragon S22U1. 
Just wondering if this is a good battery life or if I should expect better compared to other phones for my usage habits.

Pixel Buds Pro or Air Pods Pro 2: Which is better with a S22U?	"I'm currently using the first gen Galaxy Buds Pro, and while they seem to be fine for listening, battery life and most indoor phone calls, I do find myself needing to reposition them within my ear a lot more often than I would like, at the risk of them falling out. 
I have been watching reviews on the newer Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, and I'm a bit disappointed to see that the mic quality is not as good as (almost any) Air Pods or the Pixel Buds Pro. 
What I would like to know is if anyone is indeed using the Pixel Buds Pro or Air Pods Pro 2 with their S22U and how has the experience been? 
I don't use many advanced features, but this is what I've grown used to with the Galaxy Buds Pro and am hoping that the functionality still exists on either Google's or Apple's buds: 
Features:
1. Single tap to pause/play music
2. Double tap to go to next track
3. Double tap to answer/end phone call
4. Long tap to switch between ANC and transparency mode
5. Charge the buds on a Qi wireless charging pad. 
Other characteristics:
6. Use my S22U/iPhone 13/Tab A to ""take over"" connection to the buds by just connecting to them from the list of bluetooth devices (or using the Galaxy Buds widget.)
7. Not have to worry about volume.  They can get loud enough when necessary.
8. Not sure what the technical term for this is... but one thing I like about my Galaxy Buds Pro is that they don't ""leak"" sound... people around me can't hear what I'm listening to... especially useful when I like to catch up on sports highlights and the person next to me is trying to sleep.   
Any feedback would be appreciated!"	N

App to record 4k 120fps videos.	"Before I made my final decision to get my Exynos S22 Ultra. I was inclined on getting the Sony Xperia 1 IV. But when it launched here in Europe, the price was really absurd (still is, for 1400 **‚Ç¨**) and the only storage option was 256GB. 
There was one thing I really hoped Samsung would introduce with their software updates for the camera app was the option to record videos in 4k 120.  Seems like this will not be the priority even for their next flagship. So I'd like to know if someone has come across a camera app that can do that?"	N
the good facial recognition made my phone last a whole work day with only one small charge at the beginning of the day	"my previous phone i switched over from is the a71. i got it partly because i heard how big the battery is and how good the battery life is. i took good care of it, only charging up to 80%. occasionally to 100 and trickle charging it a bit at night when i forgot to charge it before bed but these were rare occurrences. at work i listen to youtube all day and i would keep the display on constantly because putting a screen protector on it makes the fingerprint sensor not work, and the facial recognition was always very temperamental. it worked but only when everything was perfect, lighting, my facial hair, if i'm not wearing sunglasses, if i'm not wearing my work safety glasses. the only alternative is entering a pin or password but it's so tedious that i would just leave it on to not have to deal with this. i had to charge it so much that in a 40 hour work week i would fully drain a 20,000 mah powerbank and go maybe 20% or so into a second one.  
today was my first day at work with my new s22 ultra. i left it plugged in overnight because it can automatically stop charging at 85%, which makes it do on it's own what i've been doing manually for the past year and a half. why doesn't every phone have this feature built in? i woke up to it at 85% and after i ate breakfast and got to work it was down to something like 65%. i topped it off back to 85% and originally planned to use it the same way i used my a71, with the screen on all day but i found that the facial recognition works so well and it wakes up and unlocks so fast that i was able to leave the screen off for most of the day and only turn it on when i wanted to switch to a different video or check emails, discord, etc. i also got a screen protector that uses UV cured resin and now the fingerprint sensor actually works with a screen protector. i used this a couple of times today to wake it up at work. i don't have any power saving options turned on, i used max brightness with the full high frame rate, listening to youtube for 10 hours straight since i woke up to when i got home from work. by the time i got home it was still at roughly 35%. not only is this going to help keep my battery in better shape in the long run, but it's also going to minimize burn in. my a71 has really bad burn in from youtube and i expect this to be a thing of the past on my new phone.   
best phone i ever bought. i could never imagine spending $1200 bucks on a new phone to be worth it but my mind is changed. these quality of life improvements alone for me make it worth every penny, and that's before considering the huge storage option i got and the massive bump in specs, performance, having a built in stylus, really good cameras, etc. i could see myself not feeling a need to replace this phone for like the next 4 or 5 years assuming the battery doesn't turn into a pillow before then."

How to prioritize WiFi 6E network when available, and fallback to 5ghz when not?	"I recently upgraded my home network to a WiFi 6E router and it works great with my S22 Ultra. However, with the 6E SSID seperate from my 5ghz band, anytime I go to a part of the house where the 6E SSID gets too weak, it transitions to my 5ghz band but never comes back to the 6E network when it is strong again.
Other Android phones / roms have a feature called WiFi Priority in the advanced wifi settings, but Samsung doesn't have that.
I've tried a couple WiFi switcher apps, but none of them have been updated to handle 6ghz bands yet. I was going to go the Tasker route but just feels that's overly complicated for this.
Ideally I would have my router combine the 6ghz and 5ghz bands to a single SSID and then intelligently switch them, but either I haven't figured that out just yet or it isn't available. There's settings in my router under the Smart Connect settings that seem to imply this is possible, but I haven't gotten it to work.
Anyone else working through this situation?"	N

Coming from pixel 4a5g to S22 ultra. Fingerprint reader completely unusable (copied from r/samsunggalaxy to see if anyone has ideas)	I like to pay quickly for transit or at the store.

I have to retrain the same fingerprint region even with soft vs hard press. On pixel, the training takes place through daily use rather than tedious finger scanning sessions. It's impossible to position your fingerprint just right because the region is tiny and not indicated well. I have a glass screen protector because frankly it's necessary when your phone costs over a thousand dollars and has a special curved screen. The screen protector was expensive, very high quality and UV cured, yet it still doesnt work with the fingerprint sensor. How is this acceptable when the fingerprint could be recessed on the back?

Exynos S22 battery life 8 months after release	"I am curious as the how the Exynos S22 battery is holding up after almost 8 months of updates and the application of optimisation strategies from the users themselves.
I know the S23 looks very promising on paper, but it will be very expensive upon release and I kinda want a phone now-ish. I can get the S22 right now for 640 EUR and I expect to get an even better deal during black friday in early november. 
I am a moderately intense user that is using the phone for the occasional photo, net browsing and social media apps (fb and reddit mostly) + email. No gaming, video stuff or anything intense. I do hate battery anxiety though and I am willing to play with the settings, but I do not want to disable the phone more than 5G and AOD and minor stuff maybe.

I also thought about getting the Iphone 13 Pro since my partner has one and the battery life on that phone is pretty amazing.   
What are your opinions on that? Do I go for the S22+ or try to go for something else. I currently have the S10 and the battery life is just getting worse by the day."	N

Samsung Data Breach and moving forward.......	"I have the s22u and I love this phone and I generally enjoy what Samsung is doing as a phone company as well. They have a solid design and solid software.  
I just don't know if I really trust them all that much anymore as a company. I know you shouldn't really put trust in these big companies. At the end of the day all that matters to them is profits.  
My bank account compromised and it was directly related to Samsung. The only account that I had my bank card linked to was my Samsung account for premium care. Everything else is linked to PayPal. I have 2fa on everything as well, which is why it could only be the data breach.  
What I am having trouble with is not wanting to support them anymore. At the sametime they make such great devices that really fit into my life and what I want out of a device.  
I plan on ordering the pixel 7 but I have tried the 5 and the 6pro and returned them because of samsungs features.  
Just wonder if anyone else finds themselves in those boat after the data breach."	n

Individual transparent camera protectors for red S22U	"I ordered the red phone and would like to keep the flat look of the cameras but any individual camera protectors I found are in black or silver, some in burgundy but none in red.

Dispelling some bad reviews?	"Hello, I am a user of Note9, recently the phone is starting to feel a bit sluggish.
On my favorite online shop S22 is getting quite a lot of heat in user reviews, mainly - allegedly GPS stops working at times, problems with signal for calling, freezing and restarts, choppiness of UI (on this flagship phone?), low battery screen time. Compared to Note9 allegedly worse display (huh) and repro. Most (but not all) reviews are roughly 6 months old
I understand that people with bad experience are more motivated to write a review + I didn't find as bad feedback elsewhere. I am a bit skeptical of them to some degree
Is that bad feedback valid? Have things changed since then and did OS updates fix stuff?

Which is a proper screen protector which works with the fingerprint sensor?	"Hey all!

Charging Speed got faster over time?	When i first got my S22 Ultra the fast speed charge was alright (around 1h) but after 3+ months of using this phone the charging speed suddenly got way better (30-45mins) without making the phone hot or anything.

Pixel 7 is only $48 with an S22 trade-in...	"I love my Galaxy devices and been using them since like the S5 back in the day, maybe even earlier that I can't recall! But I also love technology and its interesting to see what is out there and available. 
Google just released the Pixel 7 today (I don't like the huge oversized Pro models, hence why I have a regular S22 right now) and their trade-in offer is pretty compelling. 
Unfortunately they don't do it like Samsung where they give you the discounted price up front, but they are basically giving fair market value ($600) for the S22 and will credit that back to you after verifying your trade in. 
I also got $100 Google Store credit plus an additional $17 and change (credit back) for being a Google One subscriber. 
Ultimately I may not keep the phone and will return it back to Google, but this is an interesting offer and I for one am looking forward to comparing the two phones and testing out the battery life on the Pixel. We know that the battery on our S22 regular has been pretty poor.

galaxy trade in?	"Hi there. I think it's about time for me to get a new phone, and I've been considering trading in my base s10 for an s22+. However, I've been looking at stories of people's phones not being accepted and the credit not going through and now I'm a bit nervous to try lol
My phone is in pretty good condition- there's no cracks or major scratches, and works pretty well all things considered. The only thing I'm worried about is the battery- it's not swollen or anything, but I do have to charge it for a little while a couple times a day so it doesn't die on me. I'm a little confused if this would disqualify my phone from credit? According to the terms and conditions it says it has to hold a charge, but it doesn't say that up front.
Does anyone have any experience with this? I'm very unsure about what to do."	N
Battery performance when gaming?	Hey guys. I have the base Exynos S22 and I know this phone is not really ment for gaming but I just feel like I might got a faulty unit. What I did was playing Asphalt 9 for 15min on default graphics setting with 48hz(setting in game launcher) with about 40% brightness on WiFi. After that time my battery dropped from 71% to 60%. Device Care claims that it drained 4%(Again I know it's not that accurate but the difference between 4% and 11% is big). I get that Asphalt 9 is a pretty demanding game but I wouldn't expect the battery to be that bad on a newest flagship. Considering that the best I can get is 5 hours SoT(on the lightest usage possible) playing a game for a while would just be a huge hit on the battery. Also camera and image proccesing apps consume tons of battery. I just don't understand the point of having such powerfull CPU when it's limited so much by the battery. Literally using anything that makes this phone a flagship drains battery like crazy. The question for you is: is it just the way S22 is or there is something wrong with my unit? I showed a gaming battery performance because I think it's easy to replicate since there are no background activities, no switching through apps, just using one thing at the time with consistent CPU load.	N
I just bought my S22 Plus this week. Why is my phone overheating even with minor use?	"Hey guys. Some background, my last phone was an S10+ that lasted me 3 years and was probably the best phone I had without issue (I give credit due to probably going through ADB and disabling any kind of software update the moment I first turned on my phone)
I did the same thing with my S22 Plus and so far it's working great except the battery. Everytime I plug in my wired headphone all the way to using Instagram, it begins warming up and I can see how it's affecting my battery %. I don't have  many apps installed nor do I have any programs running at the same time. I'm concerned and was hoping someone could point me in the right direction to help optimize my battery"	N

I don't want to miss out on it. I already asked in the live chat on their website, but they said they don't know.

Has anybody ever tried to compare S22 Ultra 10x RAW image with RX100 camera?	"I bought S22 Ultra mainly for the 10x camera and had been having this phone for quite a while now. I found the image quality 'usable' and can be decent in some specific circumstances (the example being the water lily image in the thumbnail, still object - lot light), however, it wasn't something that I would consider great (and it's pretty close to actually being unusable outside of Pro mode) 
Something came up and I may actually need to buy a camera, and that RX100 is one of the options on the list. I wonder if that camera will be a major improvement over my phone. My major wishlist for it would be a significant improvement on the zoom camera, and I have seen some German sites comparing the 10x image to the RX100 10x, and the latter do look quite a bit better - however, my understanding is that the image wasn't taken in Pro mode (and the 10x can look significantly worse with the phone AI post-processing, you can take significantly better images without it) 
So I wonder if anyone ever try comparing those personally? Both shoot in full manual.

Super quick and snappy S22U settings.	"Hey everyone, if you're looking for a quick and snappy experience on your S22U, here are some settings I have landed on. **Disclaimer:** **These settings will take a toll on your daily battery life.**  
**Good Guardians and Memory Guardian -** Once you have downloaded the **Good Guardians** app, download the **Memory Guardian** module and open it. Once inside, click on **Customize** at the bottom right, and select **'Speed up top app mode'**. The description of what it does is included once you click on it. Hit **apply**.   
**Processing Speed -** I have mine set to 'Maximum', but you could likely fare out with the 'High' setting.  You can find this in your quick toggles from the pull down menu.   
**Animations Disabled -** If you really want an even snappier experience, turn off your animations completely. Go into **Developer Options** and scroll down until you find the animation settings. I have turned **Window Animation Scale**, **Transition Animation Scale**, and **Animator Duration Scale** **off**. This is personal preference, but in my experience, animations tend to slow navigation down at times.   
Once you apply these settings, you should see an increased speed in daily tasks and navigation. I also noticed that a lot of the screen lag went away, and the refresh rate looks smoother than ever. Please let me know if you have any questions."	N

Issue I'm running is both say they support the wired standard of PPS 45W and support the device but 'Super Fast Charging 2.0' does not show up. 'Super Fast Charging' shows up. Only the Samsung one shows the 2.0 one. I did link both chargers below for reference. I want to know a few things from the community, is the charger not doing it or the phone doesn't recognize the 2.0 but is in fact doing it at 45w like some sort of proprietary thing to Samsung. I do like to charge with multiple devices. 
Couple of other things I like to mention, I have a MacBook air, that does in fact take the charge from Aergiatech one and a couple of other devices using full speeds but not the S22 Ultra.
I did find out from other posts that the Spigen one doesn't support it. It's lying about that so any help would be greatly appreciated. 
The Samsung charger is the solution but I want alternatives with better warranty than the Samsung one. I had one and it burned by getting too hot. Got it from Verizon and they refused to do anything about it. Told me to call Samsung. Samsung said it was my fault and they can't do anything so moved on to a different brand after spending 50 bucks"	N
Is there a setting to show more on screen at once? Like less spacing?	"I have switched from an Xperia 5ii to this phone and I'm absolutely loving it so far, the size difference is especially insane.
The problem I'm having is that on a lot of apps I can still only see the same amount of info as on my far smaller Xperia. For example on Tidal and Signal, there is soooo much space inbetween tracks and chats respectively. In fact on Signal I can actually see more chats on a screen half the size of the Ultra.
I have text size at its absolute lowest right now, but is there anything else I can do? I think it's mostly just so much blank space right now, far more than on my previous phone. I want to be able to utilise the far bigger screen properly!"	N
What parameters will make you upgrade S22U with new S models?	"To me:

S22 Ultra developers mode battery savings	"Hey fellow S22 users! I was wondering if someone could briefly help me with some dev mode setting I could tweak to help battery.

Thanks!"	N
S22 Ultra Pitaka case	"So I just got a pitaka case with the new design for my S22 Ultra, ive been on the market for both a slim case as well as a magsafe feature and finally ordered one from pitaka despite the price.
Arrived home, took it out of the box and install it on my phone and went ahead to test out the wireless charging compatibility using my samsung ep-n3300 charger. 
The issue is that it starts charging and then after a minute stops working. Anyone has a ideas why that's happening? Worked fine with my supcase beetle pro case which is 3 times thicker then pitaka so the pitaka case its either interfering with the charger or idk what's going on."	N
Anybody help make my dad's experience using a s22 ultra for the first time better?	"So my dad is coming from an iPhone 13. I thought it was a 12 but he said 13 so that's what I'm going with and everything to a Samsung device that he got on Friday. Below I've listed some of his complaints with the device and everything but if you guys could help me out that would be nice.
Loud alarm(something like iPhone/something loud)
Camera sucks (doesn't like how you have to learn to use it because it should be simple just to use without having to learn how to do everything on it. He also says it just sucks in general)
App drawer (prefers how it's done on an iPhone)
Battery life (sent him a video on that and hasn't seen that yet)
He just doesn't like it versus the iPhone though. He just got it and everything on Friday. I'm trying to tell him to give it some time to get used to the device and everything because this like the only other time he's been on in Android devices 2016 around the time that Nintendo released Miitomo
The reason you switch to an iPhone from that Android was because previously before having an Android he had gotten an iPhone and when he went to Android he didn't like it and everything and he went back to and iPhone and he hasn't had an Android since 2016. Like I said and I think it was an HTC but I could be wrong. Both him and my mom had one and everything but I want his experience to be good and everything because I'm someone who likes Android and has used Samsung devices more budget phones but I wouldn't say they're terrible and everything. Currently running a pixel 6 that I love a lot but I just want his overall experience. Like I said to be good, I don't want him to go back to an iPhone and everything because he didn't give the phone a try and because you just hated it along the way the entire time"	N
Samsung Pay functionality with a phone case that has a magnet.	"Hey, fellow s22ultra'ers.
I have a question about S22 Ultra payment functionality with a protective case that has a magmet in it, whether it's MagSafe or just a magnet for a phone holder. Do you know if the functionality is still there?
I remember having a Xiaomi device before and it had an option, which let me choose with which part (top, middle) of my phone I'd like to make contact with a card reder for ex. Does S22 Ultra have that, if the magnetic case does block the ability to pay?
Thanks."	N

Advice on returning	"I got the s22 ultra recently. I just saw the battery video by Mrwhostheboss.

Is this normal? My phone is charging very slow when connected to PC.	"It charges fast when connected to a wall socket. But when connected to the PC with a USB cable, it's really really slow. It says it will take almost 8 hours to fully charge (when the battery have less than 10%). Another day, I think it had an app open and it said it would take 11+ hours. I don't know if these times are accurate cause I didn't really wait, I switched to the wall charger.
I don't think the cable is a problem, I even bought another cable to try. 
And for comparison, my old motorola G6 would charge a lot faster when connected to PC, I know the battery have a different capacity, but the capacity / time to charge ratio is not right."	N
International Samsung Care Plus	"So I live in India and I purchased my S22 Ultra in Dubai and it came with an extended warranty and Samsung care plus. But they said it would be valid only in Dubai.

Why would they do this. Apple always gives an international warranty if I'm not wrong?"	N

Why can't samsung improve charge time with 45W charger?	"I had in the past some unusual experience that my S22U were charged in 30mins(!!!) from 0%&gt;100% for once. I shared my experience here in the past here. 
My question is - why can't samsung make charging faster that battery will be charged to 80% with 45W, 80-95% with 25W, and 95-100% will use 15W?
It's literally mess that phone can be fully charged in 30mins, but still it's charged in 60mins... at least they could improve charge time to 45mins with firmware upgrade.

S22 Ultra or S23 Ultra	"Hi everyone, i was about to purchase an S22 ultra on release day, but due to my carrier being the worst, i couldn't make it in time. Now, thanks to some student discounts, i can purchase an S22 ultra 256gb for about 926‚Ç¨ (instead of 1279‚Ç¨), plus i would get a galaxy watch 4 for free.
Considering I'm in Italy, so i would get the Exynos variant, would it be worth to take advantage of the discount and have a relatively ""old"" phone? Or would it be better to wait for the S23 ultra?"	N

Battery leaking at daytime	"Hello to all!
Not a ""default"" battery post about ""battery is trash"", specific problem
Intro: WQHD+, 120gz, wifi, cellular off, Bluetooth on, dark mode,  medium to high user (insta, tiktok sometimes, slack, telegram a lot, some easy games at night)
Adaptive battery is on
No smartswitch, cache cleared twice, factory reset
Before this problem, 100% to 15% SOT 3-4,5 hours, off screen time 9 to 13 hours. For me it's not great, but not awful 
A PROBLEM - noticed for a last week that my battery is draining a lot during daytime, like from 9 AM to 5 PM without any reason. To be honest - I even use my phone LESS during a daytime, and it's a time when I don't use my device much. Mostly I don't put down a phone at night before sleep, and it's draining much less then at the day when it's discharges a lot.
What could be wrong?"	N

Not Recieiving Messages...	Hey guys I wanted to know if you can help me out. I have the Samsung Galaxy s22 Ultra and I been having a problem where my phone won't receive messages.

Be careful with beta versions, New beta bricked phone	So i updated to the latest one UI 5 beta and my phone got kinda laggy, so i went to reboot my phone, It got stuck on the Samsung logo for 5 minutes while vibrating and then it kept rebooting.

So please don't use a beta on your main phone, and if you do use the beta expect bugs and crashes.	N

Buggy S22 SD. Factory reset.	"I've noticed that my handset kinda gets hung on the multitask. Ie: quickly switching between apps makes the phone to get hung on either of both screen apps. Also, coming from OnePlus 9 Pro, I feel like this phone doesn't feel as snappy although it has better hardware.

Screenshot button: pressing is very stiff/hard	"I love my SD version over everything. Battery, performance, camera, SPen and so on... it really feels like a flagship phone and boosted my motivation and productivity.
One of the few drawback right away was the a bit unpractical big size, though. Coming from a S8 size, this one lays quite heavy and big in the hand. But even after getting used to it, I am still quite uncomfortable with the combination of button presses for a screenshot (volume down + lock) executed by one hand.

Sharp Corner Issue	"I've used many Galaxy S line up ( S6 S8 S10 S21Ultra)
Currently using the S22 Ultra since it's release. The more I use the more I'm annoyed with the sharp corners. I hardly use the SPen too. It's too small and also it's doesn't feel write writing on such a small screen (It's a big phone but it's not very comfortable writing on it.)
I just miss when samsung has a flagship with rounded corners without the pen. If I'd chosen the S22+ then I would missed out on the camera, better screen, ram etc. 
Looks like I have to look elsewhere. iPhone maybe but I love the samsung phone may it just not suited for me anymore.
Anyone else has this problem like me?"	N
Rip to the best designed smartphone	"Anyone else think the S22 is the most beautiful smartphone design ever? The S21/22 camera island is a simple and elegant solution to the problem of lenses getting bigger. They perfected it this year with the subtle chamfered corners and matte glass back.  It still bamboozles me that Samsung scrimped on the battery size. I'm sure customers would've traded a slightly thicker device for manageable battery life.
It's also a shame Samsung are ditching this design next year and going down the route of the S22 Ultra with separate camera lenses. That look isn't anywhere near as distinctive, and it homogenizes the Samsung flagships with their midrange cousins."	N

My Take on Galaxy S22 Battery	"Hi All!
A couple of weeks ago I have done a post (and several comments) here on Reddit with regards of the Galaxy S22 battery. 
I was experimenting with several configuration and settings, obtaining sometimes even more than 7 Hours of SOT with still 20% of juice. 
Now I have finally dropped a resuming article on Medium about it. If you want to have a look, the link is here: [https://medium.com/@naivebanana/my-take-on-galaxy-s22-battery-7e29a66f151b](https://medium.com/@naivebanana/my-take-on-galaxy-s22-battery-7e29a66f151b)
I hope this may help someone with their choice or daily usage.
TL;DR  
Battery can be great if you are willing to accept limitations and if you don't care about paying attention to it during the day."	N
Help with a Samsung S21 Ultra and Genshin Impact	Not me, but my friend is having heavy visual glitches only with Genshin Impact, he bought the phone some time ago and the 3.0 update went smoothly, but 3.1 came in and he has been experiencing very much how the game closes by itself, visual glitches as a random sprite appearing on the screen or things getting out of it‚Äôs place, and never ending downloads any time the game closes.

Airtel 5G and Samsung updates	"Airtel seems to have released 5G in a bunch of cities. Apparently, phones need to be updated for 5G to work, including Samsung and Apple. 
Thing is, I bought my Samsung Galaxy S22 in Dubai and its a Hong Kong model (9010). This means whatever OTA update was released for the Indian variant of the S22 won't be pushed to my HK variant. 
I used to NetMonster to check if the tower next to where I live has 5G support, and sure enough, it says 5G NSA is supported.
I bought the S22 thinking it'll have support for Airtel NR bands in India, which is does. I believe it is NR 98.

Is the S22 (base) battery life that bad?	People are always complaining about it‚Äôs battery life and now I‚Äôm worried since I bought an S22. I always use the ‚Äúbattery saving‚Äù feature on my phones and my brightness is never 100%, so I‚Äôm starting to think people just use really high brightness and play games on it. What‚Äôs the battery life of the S22 like for you?	N
actual display vs screen recording	I switched from 120 refresh rate to 60 but this stuff don't look like 60 it looked like 30. I took a screen recording of me on the home screen and it looked like 60 frames per second. So my screen recording frames are higher than the display I'm looking at ? Does anyone know what is going on.	N
What will I miss on Pixel 7 Pro if I shift from S22U?	"I am really tempted to get the Pixel 7 Pro. What are those Samsung features which I will miss out on if I switch?

how can I enable emoji reactions?	It's truly puzzling. My mom and I have the same phone (S22+) and she's able to send emoji reactions to messages but I'm not.

How to prevent going to the home screen when trying to type a space (sorry, please read the description for a better explanation)	"Hey everyone - so I have a base S22. Love the phone, had it for a month or so now.
One thing is bugging me though. I use the gesture buttons to go to the app switcher/home/back (ie. just swipe up in the 3 sections at the bottom of the screen to do the corresponding action).
When I'm typing, I often end up back at the home screen when I try to hit the space bar. When I say ""often"", I mean it happens to me like 5-10 times/day.
I'm coming from an S10e and had the same gesture controls on, same keyboard, same settings, and this NEVER happened.
I've tried adjusting the way I hold the phone (b/c the screen goes right to the edge vs. the tiny tiny bezel on the S10e) but that doesn't seem to help at all.
Has anyone else run into this problem? Has anyone figured out a solution?
Thanks for the read - love this phone but this one thing is driving me NUTS over time."	N

S22 regrets	I upgraded 6 months ago from S20, which was my first Samsung phone and I was really impressed. The S22 is such a let down. I didn't pay ‚Ç¨800 to have to monitor battery, adjust frame rates, scale down CPU and still reach 6hrs/day. I assumed it would 'adapt' over time, but nope. The display isn't even that good. Seems like Samsung is a hit or miss.	N

change distance for palm rejection?	"Absolutely love this phone. Cutting way down on doom scrolling by pulling up the Concept app and doodling instead, good for the brain.
However, palm rejection is super awkward, I naturally rest my palm with the pen tip too high and slip my canvas around. Can I increase the sensitivity of this? I can't find settings."	N
NFC and pop socket	"Just got the s22 and an otter box. Seems I cannot go without a pop socket as I had it on my old phone and this new one is just not feeling right without a pop socket lol

I'm thinking of selling my S22 ultra and getting a Pixel 7 Pro	Am I nuts .. I genuinely am a little disappointed with S22 Ultra... I don't think it's as snappy as a $1800 phone should be... Is anyone else toying with the idea of changing to the Pixel 7 Pro	N
Brief comparison between the S22 and the new Pixel 7 (with photos)	"Today I stopped by Best Buy and was able to look at the new Pixel phones 7 and 7 Pro in hand and do some quick views of the body, the cameras, etc. I pre-ordered the Pixel 7 as I wanted to test it out in comparison to my S22.
**Photos link** \- [https://imgur.com/a/mBU6woG](https://imgur.com/a/mBU6woG) \- I would love to get comparison shots against the S22 in hand, but I didn't have another device with me that I could take pictures with like that! :D
In my initial view, the new Pixel phone might be a downgrade in some respects if just looking at a quick camera comparison. Of course, we know that Google does an amazing job with post processing, and I did not get an opportunity to see that in action which is why I'm keeping my pre-order so that I can.
And I do personally believe that the Pixel 7 might achieve better battery life than the S22 and I want to test that as well for my type of usage.
Cameras:-  
\- main camera on the S22 is slightly wider than main camera on Pixel 7 - noticeable  
\- ultra wide camera on S22 is also slightly wider than ultra wide camera on Pixel 7 - noticeable  
\- selfie camera on the Pixel 7 appears to be slightly sharper than the S22  
\- selfie camera on the Pixel 7 in ""wide"" mode (you have to press the button just like on Samsung) is ever so slightly wider than the S22 selfie camera. Pixel was advertising this as ""ultra wide"" but I don't believe either phone offers an ultra wide selfie experience  
\- zoom on the S22 is far superior to the zoom on the Pixel 7 - you are limited to 8x on the Pixel 7 and it will not go any further. Of course on the S22 you can go up to 10x, 20x, and 30x and also with the space zoom at night. I've actually gotten some cool shots of the moon using space zoom, so that's not a worthless feature for me.  
\- of course the higher 20x and 30x zooms on the Samsung start to lose detail and become grainy, but the 10x was still very clear and offers those 2 zoom stops above where the Pixel 7 can get to.
Body:  
\- S22 is obviously smaller and more ""one hand"" appropriate, but the Pixel 7 does not feel extremely larger in hand. If you look online you can see that it is slightly taller and wide. The Pixel 7 might not fit in some top flap closed pockets (cargo, shirt, etc) like the S22 can.  
\- The Pixel 7 feels thicker in hand than the S22 and that is not including the camera bar at the top which obviously protrudes out  
\- Pixel 7 does have a larger over 4300 mah battery and perhaps this will offer a better battery experience than the S22."	N

Can't decide between the S22 Ultra or the Z Fold 4	"Yes I realize this is the Fold subreddit but I posted this same post on the Galaxy subreddit as well in hopes of getting a couple unbiased responses.
Currently using a Note 10+ for the last 2.5 years. I use my phone for all the basics like email and text. Also use it for fantasy sports, a lot of video streaming, most of it is live sports, some light gaming, kodi, nothing to crazy.  I am unable to split view screen when using Kodi on my Note 10+ which is annoying because I'd like to have my fantasy football app on one screen and kodi on the other. 
Opinions on the crease in the middle of the screen would be greatly Appreciated. Also would like to know if you recommend getting an S-pen."	N

S20 Ultra supports 5G SA, Does the S22 Ultra not?	"Kind of left my mind for a while but I remember what a big deal it was when the S20 Ultra got 5G NR SA (Standalone Support).

I live in the same area, same SIM that SA worked on in the past but no SA. I'm also a bit perplexed on how I'm getting 5G over NSA when I explicitly disabled it.

S22 vs S22+ Battery Life	I initially wanted to buy S22 but after reading a lot of bad experiences with their battery duration I am now more leaning towards S22+. Although S22 fits me more in terms of size I am considering S22+ just because of the better battery , at least in theory. Did anonye make this switch or do you know how noticeable the difference between battery is ? Is it worth the price difference just for the battery duration?	N
Make S22U remember app settings	Is there a way to back up app settings and preferences so that when changing phone you can restore everything? When I initially setup my S22U using Smart Switch from my old S10+, it did restore the app themselves, but I had to spend hours setting up all my settings within each app again. I might need to switch to a new S22U soon to overcome an issue, but I'm put off doing it because it took me so long to set it up in the first place. When my wife switched iPhones it seemed to restore all app settings so I hope I can do the same with my Samsungs. Thanks for any advice!	N

How do you think the phone fairs against the new Pixel 7 Pro	"Recently bought the SD 128 version and I'm slightly regretting for not waiting until the 7 Pro released.

To anyone who owns the S22U 256gb version, is there any camera/shutter lag when taking photos?	"Or is it instant? This is pretty much going to be the deciding factor for me between the iPhone 14 pro Max. I've never owned an iPhone before, however over the years every android phone that I've ever owned has always had some lag and it drives me crazy. I hear the iPhone is reliably instant with its camera and it might just be the reason for me to jump ship. 
I currently own a Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 pro, before that I had a Samsung S9; both have been equally as bad with regards to shutter lag. Of course no matter what I choose it's going to be much better than what I'm currently using, but to pay ¬£1000+ and still experience the same problems would drive me nuts."	N
