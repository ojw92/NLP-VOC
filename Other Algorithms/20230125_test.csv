0,S22U trouble with Google Messages,"Been having some issues and just wondering if anyone is having similar issues or can point me in the right direction. As you can see in the attachment, having trouble with Chat connecting, disconnecting, refusing to send. Frustrating when I think I send a message through Android auto only to arrive at my destination and he never got it because it never sent. Trying to do some trouble shooting on my own before going in to TMO. FWIW he is on a Fold 4, other son is on a pixel 7 but it doesn't happen as frequently with him. Any thoughts appreciated

1,Minimize - maximize required to transition screen,"This first occurred a few months ago after an automatic OS update. In most apps if I click an option that would normally take me to another screen, nothing happens. I have to minimize the app and then maximize it to see the screen change. This was corrected with one update but is back. Don't think I'm running anything that would affect my display settings. 
Any ideas or suggestions to fix this problem?

4,S908U1UES2BWA2 Update and Bluetooth Issues,"Hey hey. Anyone else having issues with the [S908U1UES2BWA2](https://doc.samsungmobile.com/SM-S908U1/XAA/doc.html) over-the-air update and Bluetooth? After installing this, my Xbox Elite Series 2 stopped working and now I can no longer pair it. Additionally,  my SPen also stopped connecting. Interestingly enough, other Bluetooth devices such as earbuds, watches, computers still pair and work appropriately.

I'm thinking this has to be a bug with the specific Bluetooth profile being used by these devices (BLE, maybe?), but wanted to check with ya'll before found any deeper. 

Any trouble shooting advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!
