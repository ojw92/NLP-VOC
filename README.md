# NLP-for-Text-Classification

Hello!


This repository stores (lots of) notes, project files and data files that I have used to teach myself about natural language processing (NLP) for text classification.

Some of the concepts covered in the notes and projects of this repository include:

    * NLP & sentiment analysis
    * data preparation (preprocessing) for NLP
    * word embeddings
    * convolutional neural network (CNN)
    * recurrent neural network (RNN)
    * Bag-of-Words
    * ROC curve & AUC
    * Tf-idf
    * Word2Vec
    * CART
    * Random forest
    * ... and much more!

This will mainly serve as a backup folder for my ongoing projects and notes I will be taking from learning new skills related to NLP. But I hope that it can also help others who are also on a journey to become better data scientists!

Thank you!


P.S.
Currently, there are lots of unorganized code blocks that I have written for just myself to understand concepts and test functions for my project.
I will be cleaning these code blocks and uploading them in parts over time in order to create a more pleasant reading & learning experience for myself and my potential audience.
If there are any questions or suggestions for improving this repository, please do not hesitate to contact me at joh15@illinois.edu.
Thank you!
